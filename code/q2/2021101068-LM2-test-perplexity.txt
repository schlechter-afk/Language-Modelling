besides athos was very easy and a noble to his fingers ends	277.5216194398596
when a thing suited him he paid the price demanded without thinking to ask for a	318.5139117283055
dartagnan would have remonstrated at this but athos put his hand upon his should	91.42850393832259
the musketeer met with a superb andalusian horse black as jet nostrils of fire l	337.0482827935803
he examined him and found him sound and without blemish	491.51694455667376
they asked a thousand livres for him	147.3809912832307
he might perhaps have been bought for less but while dartagnan was discussing th	162.67408399038626
grimaud had a stout short picard cob which cost three hundred livres	266.2132440594735
but when the saddle and arms for grimaud were purchased athos had not a sou left	283.25566704319914
dartagnan offered his friend a part of his share which he should return when con	94.8538841968315
but athos only replied to this proposal by shrugging his shoulders	416.5592361232623
how much did the jew say he would give for the sapphire if he purchased it said 	193.34097084271082
five hundred pistoles	14.51056389035494
that is to say two hundred morea hundred pistoles for you and a hundred pistoles	77.65799235147406
well now that would be a real fortune to us my friend let us go back to the jews	32.35556070728215
what will you	13.643170270215098
this ring would certainly only recall very bitter remembrances then we shall nev	1012.8304267720764
go and tell him the ring is his dartagnan and bring back the two hundred pistole	146.26321328586377
reflect athos	10.87701658402377
ready money is needful for the present time and we must learn how to make sacrif	178.3671541182665
go dartagnan go grimaud will accompany you with his musketoon	87.07598596640538
a half hour afterward dartagnan returned with the two thousand livres and withou	95.15563923689685
it was thus athos found at home resources which he did not expect	104.08291642101467
chapter xxxix	2.563630071088459
a vision	11494.332594417949
at four oclock the four friends were all assembled with athos	38.501666375097656
their anxiety about their outfits had all disappeared and each countenance only 	543.6385145342716
suddenly planchet entered bringing two letters for dartagnan	143.1671205167506
the one was a little billet genteelly folded with a pretty seal in green wax on 	561.7040196273161
the other was a large square epistle resplendent with the terrible arms of his e	225.38261583961102
at the sight of the little letter the heart of dartagnan bounded for he believed	78.86486851578982
he therefore seized the little epistle and opened it eagerly	226.8800152193473
be said the letter on thursday next at from six to seven oclock in the evening o	118.09846282891581
no signature	208566.95666405457
that s a snare said athos do nt go dartagnan	24.9718243957933
and yet replied dartagnan i think i recognize the writing	52.05688310647335
it may be counterfeit said athos	14.725889621026466
between six and seven oclock the road of chaillot is quite deserted you might as	157.24469422466638
but suppose we all go said dartagnan what the devil they wo nt devour us all fou	128.7603689189976
and besides it will be a chance for displaying our new equipments said porthos	146.17717483263624
but if it is a woman who writes said aramis and that woman desires not to be see	78.62073490668229
we will remain in the background said porthos and he will advance alone	66.40153646649124
yes but a pistol shot is easily fired from a carriage which goes at a gallop	388.4175634909569
bah said dartagnan they will miss me if they fire we will ride after the carriag	96.68403843458358
they must be enemies	435.8155090421379
he is right said porthos battle	120.80198731684973
besides we must try our own arms	100.19842420254709
bah let us enjoy that pleasure said aramis with his mild and careless manner	117.06738064008586
as you please said athos	10.414112124232695
gentlemen said dartagnan it is half past four and we have scarcely time to be on	51.71298911514394
besides if we go out too late nobody will see us said porthos and that will be a	56.899033911174804
let us get ready gentlemen	124.93231872971265
but this second letter said athos you forget that it appears to me however that 	48.784367599309455
for my part i declare dartagnan i think it of much more consequence than the lit	179.90279332570182
dartagnan blushed	649.1678542760837
well said he let us see gentlemen what are his eminences commands and dartagnan 	105.70202252289356
dartagnan of the kings guards company dessessart is expected at the palaiscardin	130.09812765551348
la houdiniere captain of the guards	36.78295614913945
the devil said athos heres a rendezvous much more serious than the other	102.98928544762364
i will go to the second after attending the first said dartagnan	83.77350586755959
one is for seven oclock and the other for eight there will be time for both	124.51493858318459
hum i would not go at all said aramis	30.232562525497407
a gallant knight can not decline a rendezvous with a lady but a prudent gentlema	293.33433626171166
i am of aramiss opinion said porthos	27.25055091851623
gentlemen replied dartagnan i have already received by monsieur de cavois a simi	17.84320975032935
i neglected it and on the morrow a serious misfortune happened to meconstance di	367.7160226448523
whatever may ensue i will go	172.34955115944624
if you are determined said athos do so	45.693668066771345
but the bastille said aramis	22.714402423294487
bah you will get me out if they put me there said dartagnan	64.17605420488924
to be sure we will replied aramis and porthos with admirable promptness and deci	66.70260114852098
let us do better than that said athos do not let us leave him during the whole e	35.97146559268681
let each of us wait at a gate of the palace with three musketeers behind him if 	160.79804098419976
it is a long time since we have had a skirmish with the guards of monsieur the c	40.91584244872878
to a certainty athos said aramis you were meant to be a general of the army what	76.0804188850899
admirable replied the young men in chorus	40.5776534080573
well said porthos i will run to the htel and engage our comrades to hold themsel	67.96421155854723
meantime you see that the lackeys saddle the horses	185.8039095422867
i have no horse said dartagnan but that is of no consequence i can take one of m	39.21125838064209
that is not worth while said aramis you can have one of mine	42.44120017437034
one of yours how many have you then asked dartagnan	79.2935686932062
three replied aramis smiling	91.97096513765517
certes cried athos you are the bestmounted poet of france or navarre	25.411518383221622
well my dear aramis you do nt want three horses i can not comprehend what induce	62.69372219890966
therefore i only purchased two said aramis	76.22697775710277
the third then fell from the clouds i suppose	291.0765725770199
no the third was brought to me this very morning by a groom out of livery who wo	243.0791771811554
or his mistress interrupted dartagnan	272.51227490176746
that makes no difference said aramis coloring and who affirmed as i said that he	199.5516220298418
it is only to poets that such things happen said athos gravely	198.78890457786827
well in that case we can manage famously said dartagnan which of the two horses 	166.27835087294923
that which was given to me assuredly	389.05874017359645
you can not for a moment imagine dartagnan that i would commit such an offense t	97.96417779272197
the unknown giver interrupted dartagnan	3412.353762666925
or the mysterious benefactress said athos	86.76720281801663
the one you bought will then become useless to you	403.04020131811575
nearly so	317.5282248115154
and you selected it yourself	452.08798574230565
with the greatest care	129.57652597512347
the safety of the horseman you know depends almost always upon the goodness of h	303.15518694437776
well transfer it to me at the price it cost you	177.06375353381026
i was going to make you the offer my dear dartagnan giving you all the time nece	41.96910314616475
how much did it cost you	62.42212100763124
eight hundred livres	46.88580202630529
here are forty double pistoles my dear friend said dartagnan taking the sum from	85.28569812962122
you are rich then said aramis	20.840051299424324
rich richest my dear fellow	124.42270657451905
and dartagnan chinked the remainder of his pistoles in his pocket	92.20096565072258
send your saddle then to the htel of the musketeers and your horse can be brough	53.18707635250579
very well but it is already five oclock so make haste	115.2059901266756
a quarter of an hour afterward porthos appeared at the end of the rue frou on a 	10.733789200273836
mousqueton followed him upon an auvergne horse small but very handsome	403.95623133542205
porthos was resplendent with joy and pride	180.35286529689543
at the same time aramis made his appearance at the other end of the street upon 	21.72112861437888
bazin followed him upon a roan holding by the halter a vigorous mecklenburg hors	405.7105725559487
the two musketeers met at the gate	26.100072578044593
athos and dartagnan watched their approach from the window	54.479717889141206
the devil cried aramis you have a magnificent horse there porthos	60.442856533555634
yes replied porthos it is the one that ought to have been sent to me at first	41.661116802667294
a bad joke of the husbands substituted the other but the husband has been punish	621.7407782079264
planchet and grimaud appeared in their turn leading their masters steeds	158.79204956888083
dartagnan and athos put themselves into saddle with their companions and all fou	105.90296704673086
the lackeys followed	1497.4517358290962
as porthos had foreseen the cavalcade produced a good effect and if mme	82.1258409035062
coquenard had met porthos and seen what a superb appearance he made upon his han	152.6358034502925
near the louvre the four friends met with m	40.27860084706829
de trville who was returning from st	24.29281866556545
germain he stopped them to offer his compliments upon their appointments which i	203.2340426513927
dartagnan profited by the circumstance to speak to m	139.01684433184786
de trville of the letter with the great red seal and the cardinals arms	188.46918465758836
it is well understood that he did not breathe a word about the other	23.77459294035198
de trville approved of the resolution he had adopted and assured him that if on 	135.82495206832908
at this moment the clock of la samaritaine struck six the four friends pleaded a	82.82780237456944
de trville	1.057343244662749
a short gallop brought them to the road of chaillot the day began to decline car	110.63609322465344
dartagnan keeping at some distance from his friends darted a scrutinizing glance	361.62192167926185
at length after waiting a quarter of an hour and just as twilight was beginning 	94.35288915358754
a presentiment instantly told dartagnan that this carriage contained the person 	411.37747466495915
almost instantly a female head was put out at the window with two fingers placed	222.39788657917472
dartagnan uttered a slight cry of joy this woman or rather this apparitionfor th	44.18564377124576
by an involuntary movement and in spite of the injunction given dartagnan put hi	133.56299132265477
dartagnan then remembered the injunction if you value your own life or that of t	385.27525793936394
he stopped therefore trembling not for himself but for the poor woman who had ev	83.52688150608377
the carriage pursued its way still going at a great pace till it dashed into par	510.52532990610996
dartagnan remained fixed to the spot astounded and not knowing what to think	271.6677807642679
if it was mme	15.742001538633845
bonacieux and if she was returning to paris why this fugitive rendezvous why thi	252.1232849363024
his three companions joined him	162.60234844257607
all had plainly seen a womans head appear at the window but none of them except 	450.27629079539736
the opinion of athos was that it was indeed she but less preoccupied by that pre	135.65724598749006
if that be the case said dartagnan they are doubtless transporting her from one 	72.06021290998503
but what can they intend to do with the poor creature and how shall i ever meet 	69.72093539786572
friend said athos gravely remember that it is the dead alone with whom we are no	64.1083687434537
you know something of that as well as i do i think	29.93780310583281
now if your mistress is not dead if it is she we have just seen you will meet wi	59.78466941329282
and perhaps my god added he with that misanthropic tone which was peculiar to hi	96.31220065688747
half past seven had sounded	618.4925796306128
the carriage had been twenty minutes behind the time appointed	98.17447136402204
dartagnans friends reminded him that he had a visit to pay but at the same time 	57.32960504496172
but dartagnan was at the same time impetuous and curious	43.20929283135955
he had made up his mind that he would go to the palaiscardinal and that he would	20.29906967289325
nothing could turn him from his purpose	320.43075337861694
they reached the rue st	21.792229453542628
honor and in the place du palaiscardinal they found the twelve invited musketeer	235.62030268920776
there only they explained to them the matter in hand	246.9413803400513
dartagnan was well known among the honorable corps of the kings musketeers in wh	195.9370447618779
it resulted from these antecedents that everyone entered heartily into the purpo	456.9143626737164
athos divided them into three groups assumed the command of one gave the second 	724.0395512883108
dartagnan on his part entered boldly at the principal gate	330.33900003969524
although he felt himself ably supported the young man was not without a little u	65.73695944292476
his conduct toward milady bore a strong resemblance to treachery and he was very	387.2613428329743
still further de wardes whom he had treated so ill was one of the tools of his e	95.53080099783215
if de wardes has related all our affair to the cardinal which is not to be doubt	127.59768120025062
but why has he waited till now that s all plain enough	260.04220494397265
milady has laid her complaints against me with that hypocritical grief which ren	218.9491961117235
fortunately added he my good friends are down yonder and they will not allow me 	115.23252654441265
nevertheless monsieur de trvilles company of musketeers alone can not maintain a	103.26072485677732
dartagnan my friend you are brave you are prudent you have excellent qualities b	269.75976279695806
he came to this melancholy conclusion as he entered the antechamber	145.26227438142251
he placed his letter in the hands of the usher on duty who led him into the wait	101.59182777447121
in this waiting room were five or six of the cardinals guards who recognized dar	147.6045000494183
this smile appeared to dartagnan to be of bad augury	288.83398302628603
only as our gascon was not easily intimidatedor rather thanks to a great pride n	240.17437063703662
the usher returned and made a sign to dartagnan to follow him	39.246649795332246
it appeared to the young man that the guards on seeing him depart chuckled among	104.96169221492038
he traversed a corridor crossed a grand saloon entered a library and found himse	251.0489944425066
the usher introduced him and retired without speaking a word	191.50589190720723
dartagnan remained standing and examined this man	93.2080773627255
dartagnan at first believed that he had to do with some judge examining his pape	188.57957624226015
he saw then that he was with a poet	65.09383780689924
at the end of an instant the poet closed his manuscript upon the cover of which 	74.7922977633138
dartagnan recognized the cardinal	73.83040857872767
chapter xl	2.568348419228478
a terrible vision	4541.851948529053
the cardinal leaned his elbow on his manuscript his cheek upon his hand and look	165.67164096259978
no one had a more searching eye than the cardinal de richelieu and dartagnan fel	53.002157619642524
he however kept a good countenance holding his hat in his hand and awaiting the 	147.65180521266788
monsieur said the cardinal are you a dartagnan from barn	24.980053829697358
yes monseigneur replied the young man	25.143348815540975
there are several branches of the dartagnans at tarbes and in its environs said 	173.37213099176478
i am the son of him who served in the religious wars under the great king henry 	118.83400506751828
that is well	36.13568888269931
it is you who set out seven or eight months ago from your country to seek your f	76.29363250144314
yes monseigneur	15336.705752167165
you came through meung where something befell you	365.4021735638107
i do nt very well know what but still something	182.79894689602142
monseigneur said dartagnan this was what happened to me	35.96042105832802
never mind never mind resumed the cardinal with a smile which indicated that he 	55.152353042110654
you were recommended to monsieur de trville were you not	30.48588367850939
yes monseigneur but in that unfortunate affair at meung	374.80965275314213
the letter was lost replied his eminence yes i know that	142.91959233999302
but monsieur de trville is a skilled physiognomist who knows men at first sight 	153.5625785694857
monseigneur is correctly informed said dartagnan	543.0876770924616
since that time many things have happened to you	74.0246436339456
you were walking one day behind the chartreux when it would have been better if 	58.9874030554042
then you took with your friends a journey to the waters of forges they stopped o	58.309381418119514
that is all very simple you had business in england	106.40251092705996
monseigneur said dartagnan quite confused i went	211.7801818429144
hunting at windsor or elsewherethat concerns nobody	654.8570461548277
i know because it is my office to know everything	99.47548311226889
on your return you were received by an august personage and i perceive with plea	217.76191818258553
dartagnan placed his hand upon the queens diamond which he wore and quickly turn	178.15660446632228
the day after that you received a visit from cavois resumed the cardinal	59.81455279376896
he went to desire you to come to the palace	96.78828634119155
you have not returned that visit and you were wrong	91.89679210957078
monseigneur i feared i had incurred disgrace with your eminence	1099.9240871268141
how could that be monsieur could you incur my displeasure by having followed the	525.4337187203358
as a proof remember the date of the day on which i had you bidden to come to me 	73.95535140119198
that was the very evening when the abduction of mme	49.72912115050606
bonacieux took place	83.00061668591064
dartagnan trembled and he likewise recollected that during the past half hour th	255.46881746673486
in short continued the cardinal as i have heard nothing of you for some time pas	37.3361036547588
besides you owe me some thanks	73.75570600721451
you must yourself have remarked how much you have been considered in all the cir	70.802200413135
dartagnan bowed with respect	190.50848448755488
that continued the cardinal arose not only from a feeling of natural equity but 	144.14592420230377
dartagnan became more and more astonished	132.96274921128247
i wished to explain this plan to you on the day you received my first invitation	115.2000573537716
fortunately nothing is lost by this delay and you are now about to hear it	85.35327342147652
sit down there before me dartagnan you are gentleman enough not to listen standi	132.36608826904867
and the cardinal pointed with his finger to a chair for the young man who was so	32.14423000687524
you are brave monsieur dartagnan continued his eminence you are prudent which is	114.23578029317349

do nt be afraid said he smiling	32.946741334691524
by men of heart i mean men of courage	425.7740578443148
but young as you are and scarcely entering into the world you have powerful enem	296.1447486561001
alas monseigneur replied the young man very easily no doubt for they are strong 	109.48874538313542
yes that s true but alone as you are you have done much already and will do stil	82.78156620152049
yet you have need i believe to be guided in the adventurous career you have unde	103.85758958969635
i am at the age of extravagant hopes monseigneur said dartagnan	115.31387702905263
there are no extravagant hopes but for fools monsieur and you are a man of under	194.5854969051301
now what would you say to an ensigns commission in my guards and a company after	104.9630936140567
ah monseigneur	23289.44692393812
you accept it do you not	56.767814372749
monseigneur replied dartagnan with an embarrassed air	26.922312359946776
how you refuse cried the cardinal with astonishment	79.72893313656255
i am in his majestys guards monseigneur and i have no reason to be dissatisfied	115.26808283529805
but it appears to me that my guardsmineare also his majestys guards and whoever 	128.08138743355403
monseigneur your eminence has ill understood my words	280.24506794913646
you want a pretext do you not i comprehend	221.58471934927525
well you have this excuse advancement the opening campaign the opportunity which	780.2345158401771
as regards yourself the need of protection for it is fit you should know monsieu	278.8095484955907
you do not consecrate your days and nights wholly to the kings service	233.2623291188299
dartagnan colored	2706.4440251853184
in fact said the cardinal placing his hand upon a bundle of papers i have here a	36.55648486315318
i know you to be a man of resolution and your services well directed instead of 	171.4692472977354

your goodness confounds me monseigneur replied dartagnan and i am conscious of a	117.40352045312707
dartagnan paused	1396.6086940914345
yes speak	2130.6790578637924
then i will presume to say that all my friends are in the kings musketeers and g	47.04740723405074
do you happen to entertain the haughty idea that i have not yet made you an offe	66.97755907143335
monseigneur your eminence is a hundred times too kind to me and on the contrary 	59.000230537796156
the siege of la rochelle is about to be resumed monseigneur	166.6997430225986
i shall serve under the eye of your eminence and if i have the good fortune to c	59.79025715457009
everything is best in its time monseigneur	778.9939895395997
hereafter perhaps i shall have the right of giving myself at present i shall app	60.69186616852913
that is to say you refuse to serve me monsieur said the cardinal with a tone of 	21.61963052830159
well well said the cardinal i do nt wish you any ill but you must be aware that 	34.504130597766355
we owe nothing to our enemies and let me give you a piece of advice take care of	88.74443203749404
i will try to do so monseigneur replied the gascon with a noble confidence	62.3156525397149
remember at a later period and at a certain moment if any mischance should happe	281.5817519991785
i shall entertain whatever may happen said dartagnan placing his hand upon his b	126.04613457616198
well let it be then as you have said monsieur dartagnan we shall see each other 	22.52589973842388
i will have my eye upon you for i shall be there replied the cardinal pointing w	35.54792704458265
ah monseigneur cried dartagnan spare me the weight of your displeasure	249.04080257663924
remain neutral monseigneur if you find that i act as becomes a gallant man	486.4213084055867
young man said richelieu if i shall be able to say to you at another time what i	21.542527836755298
this last expression of richelieus conveyed a terrible doubt it alarmed dartagna	473.7552245711483
the cardinal then was seeking to preserve him from some misfortune which threate	154.7294258461815

with a word dartagnan reassured them and planchet ran to inform the other sentin	94.38110270511216

and you were right cried aramis and porthos with one voice	54.83372161853952
athos fell into a profound reverie and answered nothing	182.35529162357122
but when they were alone he said you have done that which you ought to have done	44.24383347852061
dartagnan sighed deeply for this voice responded to a secret voice of his soul w	114.43974140324438
the whole of the next day was spent in preparations for departure	119.82315423289516
dartagnan went to take leave of m	85.9860854302164
de trville	1.0459206090293438
at that time it was believed that the separation of the musketeers and the guard	61.68640934910822
de trville contented himself with asking dartagnan if he could do anything for h	71.74847904917465

dessessart and the company of musketeers of m	99.02068897341067

they were parting to meet again when it pleased god and if it pleased god	484.11247056782963
that night then was somewhat riotous as may be imagined	318.83560248009695
in such cases extreme preoccupation is only to be combated by extreme carelessne	604.0160030797803

to whom nobody knew	4978.429878678602
kitty who was to set out that evening for tours was waiting in the next chamber	57.148484180515425
athos sipped the last bottle of his spanish wine	282.32187185381616

chapter xli	2.395726707219773
the siege of la rochelle	64.58742753045168
the siege of la rochelle was one of the great political events of the reign of l	53.0769058067236
and one of the great military enterprises of the cardinal	262.5026038961641
it is then interesting and even necessary that we should say a few words about i	102.02510069502586
the political plans of the cardinal when he undertook this siege were extensive	1322.3991853273008
let us unfold them first and then pass on to the private plans which perhaps had	167.48446779286078
of the important cities given up by henry iv	281.62230404896616
to the huguenots as places of safety there only remained la rochelle	539.9905233032065
it became necessary therefore to destroy this last bulwark of calvinisma dangero	121.34686843259387
spaniards englishmen and italian malcontents adventurers of all nations and sold	1023.6324097160441

we have hinted that by the side of these views of the leveling and simplifying m	104.10351515892773
richelieu as everyone knows had loved the queen	508.49812337138053
was this love a simple political affair or was it naturally one of those profoun	258.9759081785301
it was then richelieus object not only to get rid of an enemy of france but to a	48.34604173936489
richelieu knew that in combating england he combated buckingham that in triumphi	228.78968009115385
on his side buckingham in pretending to maintain the honor of england was moved 	190.9331871009604
buckingham also was pursuing a private vengeance	1022.6712924491909
buckingham could not under any pretense be admitted into france as an ambassador	311.65568774681014
it resulted from this that the real stake in this game which two most powerful k	579.7135175021475
the first advantage had been gained by buckingham	88.61748835527625
arriving unexpectedly in sight of the isle of r with ninety vessels and nearly t	286.5906321304753

this event had hastened the resolutions of the cardinal and till the king and he	139.9252992769275
it was of this detachment sent as a vanguard that our friend dartagnan formed a 	214.47069787775126

he was notwithstanding anxious to set out but his illness becoming more serious 	474.6655880113693
now whenever the king halted the musketeers halted	989.2021869685282

dessessart took up their quarters at the minimes but as we know dartagnan posses	57.0217193062601
his reflections were not very cheerful	373.4803492644158
from the time of his arrival in paris he had been mixed up with public affairs b	67.63616325329535
as to love the only woman he could have loved was mme	155.53439451741536
bonacieux and mme	9.937407117501595
bonacieux had disappeared without his being able to discover what had become of 	89.37527739832572
as to fortune he had madehe humble as he wasan enemy of the cardinal that is to 	226.36509974263055
that man had the power to crush him and yet he had not done so	41.68497224499322
for a mind so perspicuous as that of dartagnan this indulgence was a light by wh	142.39573644448615
then he had made himself another enemy less to be feared he thought but neverthe	137.84913447479758
this enemy was milady	106.5815080837404
in exchange for all this he had acquired the protection and good will of the que	131.08011692206185
what he had clearly gained in all this was the diamond worth five or six thousan	154.3596366807429
we say the gravel he trod under his feet for dartagnan made these reflections wh	414.14376379846203
now these reflections had led him further than he intended and the day was begin	395.80484275925636
dartagnan had a quick eye and a prompt understanding	208.5691246227114
he comprehended that the musket had not come there of itself and that he who bor	160.00969595987783
he determined therefore to direct his course as clear from it as he could when o	117.1951712498172
this was evidently an ambuscade	342.7277752353108
the young man cast a glance at the first musket and saw with a certain degree of	48.44136832076549
at the same instant the gun was fired and he heard the whistling of a ball pass 	52.46824752433575
no time was to be lost	117.52915606351527
dartagnan sprang up with a bound and at the same instant the ball from the other	59.48041544419193
dartagnan was not one of those foolhardy men who seek a ridiculous death in orde	235.6496285205941
besides courage was out of the question here dartagnan had fallen into an ambush	255.56653340396863
if there is a third shot said he to himself i am a lost man	45.89014163079091
he immediately therefore took to his heels and ran toward the camp with the swif	68.55163267785382
as he however had no other hat he picked up this as he ran and arrived at his qu	154.08496887001252
he sat down without saying a word to anybody and began to reflect	123.03976913253736
this event might have three causes	709.9121294365262
the first and the most natural was that it might be an ambuscade of the rochella	58.55261695195977
dartagnan took his hat examined the hole made by the ball and shook his head	106.30595214499029
the ball was not a musket ballit was an arquebus ball	212.20899231147604
the accuracy of the aim had first given him the idea that a special weapon had b	234.44768593017452
this could not then be a military ambuscade as the ball was not of the regular c	269.9503332990245
this might be a kind remembrance of monsieur the cardinal	83.76911188754555
it may be observed that at the very moment when thanks to the ray of the sun he 	66.31398349215927
but dartagnan again shook his head	69.72445951339417
for people toward whom he had but to put forth his hand his eminence had rarely 	387.7336230700857
it might be a vengeance of milady that was most probable	95.29758332666718
he tried in vain to remember the faces or dress of the assassins he had escaped 	180.46667780063532
ah my poor friends murmured dartagnan where are you and that you should fail me	64.15732880257143
dartagnan passed a very bad night	240.15169594271018
three or four times he started up imagining that a man was approaching his bed f	149.86260309415442
nevertheless day dawned without darkness having brought any accident	1702.113069177954
but dartagnan well suspected that that which was deferred was not relinquished	2585.4640663057835
dartagnan remained all day in his quarters assigning as a reason to himself that	509.9866437975376
at nine oclock the next morning the drums beat to arms	205.23502943910873
the duc dorlans visited the posts	272.07225039362874

at the expiration of a minute or two it appeared to dartagnan that m	46.80419222705558
dessessart made him a sign to approach	33.246718798583515
he waited for a fresh gesture on the part of his superior for fear he might be m	74.72100427066177

thanks my captain replied dartagnan who wished for nothing better than an opport	73.27059819426691
in fact the rochellais had made a sortie during the night and had retaken a bast	59.23985058289745
the matter was to ascertain by reconnoitering how the enemy guarded this bastion	433.23486857399587

two of his comrades of the guards immediately sprang forward and two other soldi	178.16807331347394
dartagnan declined all others being unwilling to take the first chance from thos	281.67629299094955
it was not known whether after the taking of the bastion the rochellais had evac	77.47368982866855
dartagnan set out with his four companions and followed the trench the two guard	89.43700877976578
they arrived thus screened by the lining of the trench till they came within a h	91.31400407178812
there on turning round dartagnan perceived that the two soldiers had disappeared	118.2420938114841
he thought that beginning to be afraid they had stayed behind and he continued t	152.1443687525998
at the turning of the counterscarp they found themselves within about sixty pace	262.0648707859185
they saw no one and the bastion seemed abandoned	433.9998984348722
the three composing our forlorn hope were deliberating whether they should proce	710.075649795169
they knew all they wished to know the bastion was guarded	160.89621427682496
a longer stay in this dangerous spot would have been useless imprudence	908.95226208133
dartagnan and his two companions turned their backs and commenced a retreat whic	120.75838980853884
on arriving at the angle of the trench which was to serve them as a rampart one 	60.21034153400362
a ball had passed through his breast	67.1395494615981
the other who was safe and sound continued his way toward the camp	172.86198073512287
dartagnan was not willing to abandon his companion thus and stooped to raise him	222.99467324227805
one ball struck the head of the alreadywounded guard and the other flattened its	69.41961921241001
the young man turned quickly round for this attack could not have come from the 	61.667998700079096
the idea of the two soldiers who had abandoned him occurred to his mind and with	77.59040460510828
he resolved this time to know with whom he had to deal and fell upon the body of	90.33429255804029
he quickly saw two heads appear above an abandoned work within thirty paces of h	900.1606109739374
dartagnan had not been deceived these two men had only followed for the purpose 	60.97591060252606

the assassins comprehended that if they fled toward the camp without having kill	949.9642303903495
one of them took his gun by the barrel and used it as he would a club	107.6818556699057
he aimed a terrible blow at dartagnan who avoided it by springing to one side bu	486.11245741802634
as the rochellais who guarded the bastion were ignorant of the intentions of the	115.27500852058508
meantime dartagnan had thrown himself upon the other soldier attacking him with 	230.0357671224175
the conflict was not long the wretch had nothing to defend himself with but his 	203.39381234632936
the sword of the guardsman slipped along the barrel of the nowuseless weapon and	125.4258951104707
dartagnan immediately placed the point of his sword at his throat	79.76604706484883
oh do not kill me cried the bandit	29.796922804085874
pardon pardon my officer and i will tell you all	42.95403729278644
is your secret of enough importance to me to spare your life for it asked the yo	87.68619010698738
yes if you think existence worth anything to a man of twenty as you are and who 	146.06241953898294
wretch cried dartagnan speak quickly who employed you to assassinate me	177.6108628869034
a woman whom i do nt know but who is called milady	43.491389703503195
but if you do nt know this woman how do you know her name	28.237793827219487
my comrade knows her and called her so	341.6810034962779
it was with him she agreed and not with me he even has in his pocket a letter fr	116.96582853180766
but how did you become concerned in this villainous affair	89.10816758754936
he proposed to me to undertake it with him and i agreed	107.79775617626993
and how much did she give you for this fine enterprise	190.41721062751418
a hundred louis	93.90575202265285
well come said the young man laughing she thinks i am worth something	101.77690215817329
a hundred louis well that was a temptation for two wretches like you	908.7043783819369
i understand why you accepted it and i grant you my pardon but upon one conditio	128.71923901142628
what is that said the soldier uneasy at perceiving that all was not over	129.66497320520816
that you will go and fetch me the letter your comrade has in his pocket	64.37161992348769
but cried the bandit that is only another way of killing me	128.24883946416256
how can i go and fetch that letter under the fire of the bastion	73.42634304106035
you must nevertheless make up your mind to go and get it or i swear you shall di	114.46566467142443
pardon monsieur pity in the name of that young lady you love and whom you perhap	114.39849458266775
and how do you know there is a young woman whom i love and that i believed that 	33.83267041993897
by that letter which my comrade has in his pocket	178.25781066334815
you see then said dartagnan that i must have that letter	42.22241134968659
so no more delay no more hesitation or else whatever may be my repugnance to soi	193.58820376784792
stop stop cried he regaining strength by force of terror	678.9330993165086
i will goi will go	58.829146038656475
dartagnan took the soldiers arquebus made him go on before him and urged him tow	126.02936682046618
it was a frightful thing to see this wretch leaving a long track of blood on the	77.75911359167705
terror was so strongly painted on his face covered with a cold sweat that dartag	225.02212494721022
stay where you are i will go myself	95.92290061615579
and with a light step an eye on the watch observing the movements of the enemy a	165.01890252163327
there were two means of gaining his objectto search him on the spot or to carry 	191.65589334230555
dartagnan preferred the second means and lifted the assassin onto his shoulders 	1025.3827882456999
a slight shock the dull noise of three balls which penetrated the flesh a last c	391.63199435783605
dartagnan regained the trench and threw the corpse beside the wounded man who wa	65.25621962227417
then he began to search	46.026549249878656
a leather pocketbook a purse in which was evidently a part of the sum which the 	177.28974943012815
he left the box and dice where they fell threw the purse to the wounded man and 	136.9531140070969
among some unimportant papers he found the following letter that which he had so	185.84431471787602
since you have lost sight of that woman and she is now in safety in the convent 	59.80556910104521
if you do you know that my hand stretches far and that you shall pay very dearly	258.28763043203566
no signature	333483.9462852628
nevertheless it was plain the letter came from milady	69.83103170069087
he consequently kept it as a piece of evidence and being in safety behind the an	296.9007770002225
he confessed that he had undertaken with his comradethe same who was killedto ca	284.3294524794116
but what were you to do with that woman asked dartagnan with anguish	34.90557773630326
we were to have conveyed her to a htel in the place royale said the wounded man	63.85962146378359
yes yes murmured dartagnan that s the placemiladys own residence	154.03472123270203
then the young man tremblingly comprehended what a terrible thirst for vengeance	889.0720683158756
there could be no doubt she owed this information to the cardinal	155.80258209234267
but amid all this he perceived with a feeling of real joy that the queen must ha	135.16084725979496
bonacieux was explaining her devotion and that she had freed her from that priso	211.44588378921256
then also as athos had predicted it became possible to find mme	135.13764735396506
bonacieux and a convent was not impregnable	872.9145859255259
this idea completely restored clemency to his heart	810.8916318403998
he turned toward the wounded man who had watched with intense anxiety all the va	85.60549455009962
lean upon me and let us return to the camp	35.14330657417576
yes said the man who could scarcely believe in such magnanimity but is it not to	41.8500582679637
you have my word said he for the second time i give you your life	35.095998127821346
the wounded man sank upon his knees to again kiss the feet of his preserver but 	206.39159964907748
the guardsman who had returned at the first discharge announced the death of his	117.05861690202659
they were therefore much astonished and delighted in the regiment when they saw 	115.37872368038568
dartagnan explained the sword wound of his companion by a sortie which he improv	260.05944120743584
he described the death of the other soldier and the perils they had encountered	433.82713185411933
this recital was for him the occasion of veritable triumph	661.3250865568265
the whole army talked of this expedition for a day and monsieur paid him his com	368.496765589204
besides this as every great action bears its recompense with it the brave exploi	868.7542420881028
in fact dartagnan believed that he might be tranquil as one of his two enemies w	79.62578181737523
this tranquillity proved one thingthat dartagnan did not yet know milady	313.938618106873

dartagnan as we have said had become more tranquil as always happens after a pas	174.58823986421194
he only felt one uneasiness and that was at not hearing any tidings from his fri	224.56913631616038
but one morning at the commencement of the month of november everything was expl	37.667190043061794
dartagnan mm	14.654555931484998
athos porthos and aramis after having had an entertainment at my house and enjoy	127.87250177141821
they are desirous that you should drink to their health in their favorite wine	278.700819258263
i have done this and am monsieur with great respect	183.99228325566327
your very humble and obedient servant godeau purveyor of the musketeers	533.7668866599369
that s all well cried dartagnan	41.299503069614886
they think of me in their pleasures as i thought of them in my troubles	246.13117369219884
well i will certainly drink to their health with all my heart but i will not dri	67.05364517845821
and dartagnan went among those guardsmen with whom he had formed greater intimac	145.39823874765924
one of the two guardsmen was engaged that evening and another the next so the me	116.82330220723959
dartagnan on his return sent the twelve bottles of wine to the refreshment room 	189.6197718691173
planchet very proud of being raised to the dignity of landlord thought he would 	337.4678547597287
the hour of the banquet being come the two guards arrived took their places and 	218.23842746486287

of this wine the first bottle being a little thick at the bottom brisemont poure	112.45656761431545
the guests having eaten the soup were about to lift the first glass of wine to t	199.50928315737525
the guardsmen imagining this to be caused by some unexpected attack either of th	414.84738656557715
dartagnan not less forward than they did likewise and all ran out in order to re	244.7197032529537
but scarcely were they out of the room before they were made aware of the cause 	85.43393744572712
cries of live the king live the cardinal resounded on every side and the drums w	185.3771797620702
in short the king impatient as has been said had come by forced marches and had 	306.1929649164998
his musketeers proceeded and followed him	231.35394001069744
dartagnan placed in line with his company saluted with an expressive gesture his	543.9390417148503
de trville who detected him at once	53.946124245862315
the ceremony of reception over the four friends were soon in one anothers arms	498.7756002836762
pardieu cried dartagnan you could not have arrived in better time the dinner can	115.8245040018234
ah ah said porthos it appears we are feasting	161.2675896711996
i hope said aramis there are no women at your dinner	92.43837319334146
is there any drinkable wine in your tavern asked athos	102.34874197814145
well pardieu there is yours my dear friend replied dartagnan	74.9291933623118

the wine you prefer	2020.84476716669
well in the absence of champagne and chambertin you must content yourselves with	165.72260276353705
and so connoisseurs in wine as we are we have sent you some anjou wine said port	385.25670331669664
not exactly it is the wine that was sent by your order	133.42187008237013
on our account said the three musketeers	58.354942291275364
did you send this wine aramis said athos	35.40146307304077
no and you porthos	81.4044772822561
no and you athos	84.28967806873789
if it was not you it was your purveyor said dartagnan	84.80061955259477
our purveyor	539832.7582874518
yes your purveyor godeauthe purveyor of the musketeers	448.5236102380107

no said athos do nt let us drink wine which comes from an unknown source	89.06407379206472
you are right athos said dartagnan	6.069188593298616
did none of you charge your purveyor godeau to send me some wine	344.34031592639985
no and yet you say he has sent you some as from us	83.40445816510233
here is his letter said dartagnan and he presented the note to his comrades	44.308923682081975
this is not his writing said athos	43.19677783779579
i am acquainted with it before we left villeroy i settled the accounts of the re	171.1045642678833
a false letter altogether said porthos we have not been disciplined	144.25649107133367
dartagnan said aramis in a reproachful tone how could you believe that we had ma	69.72924727645804
dartagnan grew pale and a convulsive trembling shook all his limbs	141.37764060399135
thou alarmest me said athos who never used thee and thou but upon very particula	188.80604516178784
look you my friends cried dartagnan a horrible suspicion crosses my mind can thi	383.04739987863405
it was now athos who turned pale	39.053443682285
dartagnan rushed toward the refreshment room the three musketeers and the two gu	115.43936819527875
the first object that met the eyes of dartagnan on entering the room was brisemo	50.86273604686984
planchet and fourreau as pale as death were trying to give him succor but it was	103.55346831189954
ah cried he on perceiving dartagnan ah this is frightful you pretend to pardon m	146.60584649048127
i cried dartagnan	59.63075605065105
i wretch what do you say	200.08223679977465
i say that it was you who gave me the wine i say that it was you who desired me 	36.18596033043438
i say you wished to avenge yourself on me and i say that it is horrible	53.33623363597743
do not think so brisemont said dartagnan do not think so	20.926625608053673
i swear to you i protest	84.95028411651569
oh but god is above god will punish you my god grant that he may one day suffer 	511.7595867225879
upon the gospel said dartagnan throwing himself down by the dying man i swear to	105.84213386926356
i do not believe you cried the soldier and he expired amid horrible tortures	251.77716387194891
frightful frightful murmured athos while porthos broke the bottles and aramis ga	129.9116582670358
oh my friends said dartagnan you come once more to save my life not only mine bu	77.72486066440031
gentlemen continued he addressing the guardsmen i request you will be silent wit	85.07436796156206
great personages may have had a hand in what you have seen and if talked about t	171.73346308488178
ah monsieur stammered planchet more dead than alive ah monsieur what an escape i	405.677879492136

alas said fourreau whose teeth chattered with terror i wanted to get him out of 	76.86832895572485
gentlemen said dartagnan addressing the guardsmen you may easily comprehend that	39.1537313725597
the two guardsmen courteously accepted dartagnans excuses and perceiving that th	912.4436650215298
when the young guardsman and the three musketeers were without witnesses they lo	100.76792982009073
in the first place said athos let us leave this chamber the dead are not agreeab	34.34231080771172
planchet said dartagnan i commit the corpse of this poor devil to your care	146.8043771853746
let him be interred in holy ground	347.867417357635
he committed a crime it is true but he repented of it	122.25534051456815
and the four friends quit the room leaving to planchet and fourreau the duty of 	89.54356148342025
the host gave them another chamber and served them with fresh eggs and some wate	411.57917664474087
in a few words porthos and aramis were posted as to the situation	73.54762103479038
well said dartagnan to athos you see my dear friend that this is war to the deat	21.353560632756682
athos shook his head	10.600201219743273
yes yes replied he i perceive that plainly but do you really believe it is she	46.044428690803784
i am sure of it	7.692017226985908
nevertheless i confess i still doubt	244.74724398424692
but the fleurdelis on her shoulder	2480.6705351429396
she is some englishwoman who has committed a crime in france and has been brande	34.45099593589003
athos she is your wife i tell you repeated dartagnan only reflect how much the t	172.7574948700744
yes but i should think the other must be dead i hanged her so effectually	181.48401595543137
it was dartagnan who now shook his head in his turn	24.638868075780916
but in either case what is to be done said the young man	28.038754611933904
the fact is one can not remain thus with a sword hanging eternally over his head	340.99365843898585
we must extricate ourselves from this position	445.5476498012459
but how	48.52755665072384
listen you must try to see her and have an explanation with her	72.05529945634399
say to her peace or war my word as a gentleman never to say anything of you neve	149.68962673859835
if not i will apply to the chancellor i will apply to the king i will apply to t	87.6271296022224
i like the means well enough said dartagnan but where and how to meet with her	131.03893334244938
time dear friend time brings round opportunity opportunity is the martingale of 	880.5890081778617
the more we have ventured the more we gain when we know how to wait	556.8769517979657
yes but to wait surrounded by assassins and poisoners	505.6787588275038
bah said athos	2.448322623822919
god has preserved us hitherto god will preserve us still	800.75724983544
yes we	110.83605841801104
besides we are men and everything considered it is our lot to risk our lives but	252.36612952962105
what she asked athos	41.3357346332778
madame bonacieux ah that s true said athos	24.107851014799106
my poor friend i had forgotten you were in love	57.76762123470419
well but said aramis have you not learned by the letter you found on the wretche	46.46433530881621
good cried athos good yes my dear aramis we all know that your views have a reli	108.92073570891182
i am only temporarily a musketeer said aramis humbly	339.8481296540564
it is some time since we heard from his mistress said athos in a low voice	37.95808319922103
but take no notice we know all about that	141.9176451115625
well said porthos it appears to me that the means are very simple	34.968208014695335
what asked dartagnan	18.915824845194628
you say she is in a convent replied porthos	31.59912814780785
very well	2.758717391937096
as soon as the siege is over well carry her off from that convent	387.14613176086766
but we must first learn what convent she is in	348.1108427426174
that s true said porthos	8.810020179375712
but i think i have it said athos	15.826014798145858
do nt you say dear dartagnan that it is the queen who has made choice of the con	32.5122122984624
i believe so at least	44.653067929738526
in that case porthos will assist us	47.15050308372172
and how so if you please	30.992534034756748
why by your marchioness your duchess your princess	1565.9588889862878
she must have a long arm	150.92769490307396
hush said porthos placing a finger on his lips	21.251261814577575
i believe her to be a cardinalist she must know nothing of the matter	69.28112697817959
then said aramis i take upon myself to obtain intelligence of her	80.86917747013622
you aramis cried the three friends	52.913370800495564
you and how	548.5249995735079
by the queens almoner to whom i am very intimately allied said aramis coloring	330.9818252033813
and on this assurance the four friends who had finished their modest repast sepa	125.81194882277445
dartagnan returned to less important affairs and the three musketeers repaired t	385.18249376139096

the sign of the red dovecot	209.918980507984

bassompierre and schomberg against the duc dangoulme	54.783960787430345
bassompierre and schomberg were marshals of france and claimed their right of co	138.79237437513794
the result was that to prevent mm	77.20190267553723

the cardinal fixed his piercing eyes on this courageous speaker	403.9857034757274
you have a quick ear monsieur athos said the cardinal but now listen to this	60.59375167526008
it is not from mistrust that i request you to follow me but for my security	138.39558973582749

what have been the results of your quarrel said the cardinal knitting his brow	123.61790728757923
my friend aramis here has received a slight sword wound in the arm but not enoug	178.12305170911316

these fellows were drunk said athos and knowing there was a lady who had arrived	104.06768094135555
force her door said the cardinal and for what purpose	91.14999852890095
to do her violence without doubt said athos	363.3796690267171
i have had the honor of informing your eminence that these men were drunk	88.23429569726446
and was this lady young and handsome asked the cardinal with a certain degree of	119.61553020825413
we did not see her monseigneur said athos	57.30131834869357
you did not see her ah very well replied the cardinal quickly	47.64424764638079
you did well to defend the honor of a woman and as i am going to the red dovecot	39.342930932448645
monseigneur said athos haughtily we are gentlemen and to save our heads we would	79.12417150740399
therefore i do not doubt what you say monsieur athos i do not doubt it for a sin	34.171357936341536
the lady had a cavalier shut up with her said athos but as notwithstanding the n	140.13696662718996

the host stood at the door	29.98891713802566

then seeing that none of their replies could throw any light on the subject port	453.33614491417865
porthos and aramis placed themselves at the table and began to play	32.989996403437424
athos walked about in a contemplative mood	235.30592556174525
while thinking and walking athos passed and repassed before the pipe of the stov	207.96690963023426
athos went close to it and distinguished some words that appeared to merit so gr	136.76797087026856

i must go thither tonight	147.78951285975384
instantly that is to say when you have received my instructions	44.401815714950324

now let us return to the mission with which you wish to charge me and as i desir	28.890656491959064
there was an instant of profound silence between the two interlocutors	34.075454909250425
it was evident that the cardinal was weighing beforehand the terms in which he w	85.53804587263797
athos took advantage of this moment to tell his two companions to fasten the doo	38.656753651565914
the two musketeers who loved their ease brought a chair for each of themselves a	300.77220600615846
all three then sat down with their heads together and their ears on the alert	95.92500466098477
you will go to london continued the cardinal	17.611006476296662
arrived in london you will seek buckingham	80.89112189995745
i must beg your eminence to observe said milady that since the affair of the dia	54.19233110043921
well this time said the cardinal it is not necessary to steal his confidence but	46.4644460885563
frankly and loyally repeated milady with an unspeakable expression of duplicity	166.85099898015505
yes frankly and loyally replied the cardinal in the same tone	35.310079210173505
all this negotiation must be carried on openly	603.1913969798755
i will follow your eminences instructions to the letter	113.06867705631622
i only wait till you give them	131.7421364691678
you will go to buckingham in my behalf and you will tell him i am acquainted wit	39.180485217989805
will he believe that your eminence is in a position to accomplish the threat thu	101.4635839194577
yes for i have the proofs	48.81443162056393
i must be able to present these proofs for his appreciation	85.27231960776861
without doubt	2190.8883458353434
and you will tell him i will publish the report of boisrobert and the marquis de	53.044988052296056

your eminence will judge the ball of madame the constable the night at the louvr	182.08819151195019
that s it said the cardinal that s it	31.19055896701934
you have an excellent memory milady	45.66393652469313
but resumed she to whom the cardinal addressed this flattering compliment if in 	487.01057023257147
the duke is in love to madness or rather to folly replied richelieu with great b	162.12844960172973
like the ancient paladins he has only undertaken this war to obtain a look from 	205.7219887593011
if he becomes certain that this war will cost the honor and perhaps the liberty 	183.78175360258052
and yet said milady with a persistence that proved she wished to see clearly to 	86.65494555981977
if he persists said the cardinal	204.72667102939837
that is not probable	20.82530954658157
it is possible said milady	8.918776295109549
if he persists his eminence made a pause and resumed if he persistswell then i s	207.2966359061959
if your eminence would quote to me some one of these events in history said mila	124.84299212145919

your eminence means i presume the knife stab in the rue de la feronnerie	151.92224371472162
precisely said the cardinal	20.88276582706686
does not your eminence fear that the punishment inflicted upon ravaillac may det	169.61903223954312
there will be in all times and in all countries particularly if religious divisi	272.6314595857008
ay and observeit just occurs to me that the puritans are furious against bucking	183.0324374782468
well said milady	4.660696501358198
well continued the cardinal in an indifferent tone the only thing to be sought f	74.21623999479127
the duke has had many affairs of gallantry and if he has fostered his amours by 	233.65618643489975
no doubt said milady coolly such a woman may be found	80.69999289579768
well such a woman who would place the knife of jacques clment or of ravaillac in	63.79491620545177
yes but she would then be the accomplice of an assassination	124.7927590980099
were the accomplices of ravaillac or of jacques clment ever known	187.47543496992978
no for perhaps they were too highplaced for anyone to dare look for them where t	167.28708344726226
the palace of justice would not be burned down for everybody monseigneur	417.5414303771184
you think then that the fire at the palace of justice was not caused by chance a	86.65911901041328
i monseigneur replied milady	176.77928238911653
i think nothing i quote a fact that is all	225.99948113338178
only i say that if i were named madame de montpensier or the queen marie de mdic	28.897235347052526
that is just said richelieu	14.90199965547031
what do you require then	21.91358369775132
i require an order which would ratify beforehand all that i should think proper 	445.00303924544346
but in the first place this woman i have described must be found who is desirous	147.77661713217802
she is found said milady	66.45681090601417
then the miserable fanatic must be found who will serve as an instrument of gods	207.94013643919143
he will be found	25.481609623164577
well said the cardinal then it will be time to claim the order which you just no	62.39560585923821
your eminence is right replied milady and i have been wrong in seeing in the mis	30.832264410121414
then if he persists notwithstanding all thisas that is as i have said the limit 	254.34339984025252
that is it is it not monseigneur and i shall have nothing else to do	34.44909039685124
that is it replied the cardinal dryly	53.38115397000445
and now said milady without appearing to remark the change of the dukes tone tow	197.83260157289737
have you enemies then asked richelieu	36.42145776985572
yes monseigneur enemies against whom you owe me all your support for i made them	317.8214884751812
who are they replied the duke	44.67905202227637
in the first place there is a little intrigante named bonacieux	25.605993925438256
she is in the prison of nantes	21.937415623885496
that is to say she was there replied milady but the queen has obtained an order 	41.233416598185215
to a convent said the duke	39.229857339640276
yes to a convent	337.9875343324343
and to which	629.0099717952517
i do nt know the secret has been well kept	79.29315278297742
but i will know	28.813544329112844
and your eminence will tell me in what convent that woman is	67.72736724788179
i can see nothing inconvenient in that said the cardinal	224.1163115195176
well now i have an enemy much more to be dreaded by me than this little madame b	199.88131594741145
who is that	18.986463942507076
her lover	224.8249959467186
what is his name	10.930022356652392
oh your eminence knows him well cried milady carried away by her anger	123.91292788196003
he is the evil genius of both of us	291.4530921858159
it is he who in an encounter with your eminences guards decided the victory in f	198.04487239390224
ah ah said the cardinal i know of whom you speak	37.62716701343709
i mean that miserable dartagnan	232.6082253884638
he is a bold fellow said the cardinal	26.45128645367457
and it is exactly because he is a bold fellow that he is the more to be feared	74.46835424802879
i must have said the duke a proof of his connection with buckingham	102.61017500998695
a proof cried milady i will have ten	61.56155420794263
well then it becomes the simplest thing in the world get me that proof and i wil	92.05362540864935
so far good monseigneur but afterwards	1610.6617006511922
when once in the bastille there is no afterward said the cardinal in a low voice	54.64328634144808
ah pardieu continued he if it were as easy for me to get rid of my enemy as it i	63.09514237178586
monseigneur replied milady a fair exchange	730.6729853772049
life for life man for man give me one i will give you the other	131.76129782402376
i do nt know what you mean nor do i even desire to know what you mean replied th	51.52340404348253
an infamous scoundrel monseigneur a scoundrel	2916.1797326367546
give me paper a quill and some ink then said the cardinal	349.69718175182334
here they are monseigneur	563.4428531078726
there was a moment of silence which proved that the cardinal was employed in see	65.76084930144737
athos who had not lost a word of the conversation took his two companions by the	51.587542557282404
well said porthos what do you want and why do you not let us listen to the end o	18.71060099680573
hush said athos speaking in a low voice	13.617403298691688
we have heard all it was necessary we should hear besides i do nt prevent you fr	76.0022800121602
you must be gone said porthos and if the cardinal asks for you what answer can w	78.00153872760296
you will not wait till he asks you will speak first and tell him that i am gone 	74.8044957592796
i will say two words about it to the cardinals esquire likewise	473.9088642631595
the rest concerns myself do nt be uneasy about that	244.2755124505236
be prudent athos said aramis	17.03353583955305
be easy on that head replied athos you know i am cool enough	82.11021728942833
porthos and aramis resumed their places by the stovepipe	61.997926722050934
as to athos he went out without any mystery took his horse which was tied with t	74.49541723455073
chapter xlv	3.0333201067552
a conjugal scene	1274.0070513273683
as athos had foreseen it was not long before the cardinal came down	78.28215052850345
he opened the door of the room in which the musketeers were and found porthos pl	26.103072112140474
he cast a rapid glance around the room and perceived that one of his men was mis	31.2372350127804
what has become of monseigneur athos asked he	37.52169933362308
monseigneur replied porthos he has gone as a scout on account of some words of o	50.59692628468068
and you what have you done monsieur porthos	44.36422938675885
i have won five pistoles of aramis	112.1919259257013
well now will you return with me	73.10186684932685
we are at your eminences orders	73.42676319116744
to horse then gentlemen for it is getting late	162.07843847832902
the attendant was at the door holding the cardinals horse by the bridle	63.749546024935235
at a short distance a group of two men and three horses appeared in the shade	66.87065422638612
these were the two men who were to conduct milady to fort la pointe and superint	24.706839936601735
the attendant confirmed to the cardinal what the two musketeers had already said	161.8431991788295
the cardinal made an approving gesture and retraced his route with the same prec	466.3947627384487
let us leave him to follow the road to the camp protected by his esquire and the	129.3960486627683
for a hundred paces he maintained the speed at which he started but when out of 	168.3173447355847
having recognized the laced hats of his companions and the golden fringe of the 	260.65224450092137
the host recognized him	320.4113492183546
my officer said athos has forgotten to give a piece of very important informatio	112.27246822752358
go up said the host she is still in her chamber	69.36055754197528
athos availed himself of the permission ascended the stairs with his lightest st	348.07880772502085
he entered the chamber and closed the door behind him	24.50180237602997
at the noise he made in pushing the bolt milady turned round	178.13409369102175
athos was standing before the door enveloped in his cloak with his hat pulled do	225.55592537860795
on seeing this figure mute and immovable as a statue milady was frightened	288.4248114191569
who are you and what do you want cried she	39.127770077306735
humph murmured athos it is certainly she	68.17505941247704
and letting fall his cloak and raising his hat he advanced toward milady	166.79261160344885
do you know me madame said he	11.316060950264774
milady made one step forward and then drew back as if she had seen a serpent	45.96662862266504
so far well said athos i perceive you know me	33.60885524816805
the comte de la fre murmured milady becoming exceedingly pale and drawing back t	52.657015450345
yes milady replied athos the comte de la fre in person who comes expressly from 	62.303589653435694
sit down madame and let us talk as the cardinal said	34.24855718343856
milady under the influence of inexpressible terror sat down without uttering a w	279.4924001841085
you certainly are a demon sent upon the earth said athos	235.5197686417374
your power is great i know but you also know that with the help of god men have 	147.31340056973178
you have once before thrown yourself in my path	212.63775848711802
i thought i had crushed you madame but either i was deceived or hell has resusci	171.87355020307066
milady at these words which recalled frightful remembrances hung down her head w	200.57389789304267
yes hell has resuscitated you continued athos	1148.207793519009
hell has made you rich hell has given you another name hell has almost made you 	420.21710079207907
milady arose as if moved by a powerful spring and her eyes flashed lightning	153.43368462481249
athos remained sitting	724.2301537989043
you believed me to be dead did you not as i believed you to be and the name of a	61.95797054164624
was it not so you were called when your honored brother married us our position 	570.3422993608829
we have only lived up to the present time because we believed each other dead an	152.76810641867974
but said milady in a hollow faint voice what brings you back to me and what do y	79.75726136781526
i wish to tell you that though remaining invisible to your eyes i have not lost 	122.35920959214484
you know what i have done	18.088753196025436
i can relate to you day by day your actions from your entrance to the service of	234.0192385355152
a smile of incredulity passed over the pale lips of milady	37.053634270827416
listen it was you who cut off the two diamond studs from the shoulder of the duk	140.2967634712896
in short it was you who have but now in this chamber seated in this chair i now 	178.63348073150647
milady was livid	166.4674008419114
you must be satan cried she	56.095080157848166
perhaps said athos but at all events listen well to this	77.72960475819225
assassinate the duke of buckingham or cause him to be assassinatedi care very li	158.56044599020714
besides he is an englishman	23.21361943406972
but do not touch with the tip of your finger a single hair of dartagnan who is a	50.53164594942296
monsieur dartagnan has cruelly insulted me said milady in a hollow tone monsieur	85.43678915863616
indeed is it possible to insult you madame said athos laughing he has insulted y	44.42696510192885
he shall die replied milady she first and he afterward	255.6639209867755
athos was seized with a kind of vertigo	93.44789987149112
the sight of this creature who had nothing of the woman about her recalled awful	439.68816915513287
he thought how one day in a less dangerous situation than the one in which he wa	111.1118591112233
his desire for blood returned burning his brain and pervading his frame like a r	370.12181739424517
milady pale as a corpse endeavored to cry out but her swollen tongue could utter	438.52693284104976
motionless against the dark tapestry with her hair in disorder she appeared like	334.90121939990127
athos slowly raised his pistol stretched out his arm so that the weapon almost t	262.85381811140775
with another man milady might have preserved some doubt but she knew athos	172.33500544066143
nevertheless she remained motionless	210.54582216353975
you have one second to decide said he	205.8094107657797
milady saw by the contraction of his countenance that the trigger was about to b	95.15881545202741
take it said she and be accursed	317.4862872172027
athos took the paper returned the pistol to his belt approached the lamp to be a	75.7708375350817
3 1627	10.989544100555216
it is by my order and for the good of the state that the bearer of this has done	89.64579539027879
and now said athos resuming his cloak and putting on his hat now that i have dra	41.27498254873355
and he left the chamber without once looking behind him	114.09402358385904
at the door he found the two men and the spare horse which they held	81.21414904850174
gentlemen said he monseigneurs order is you know to conduct that woman without l	524.6308307194184
as these words agreed wholly with the order they had received they bowed their h	313.14010049209213
with regard to athos he leaped lightly into the saddle and set out at full gallo	51.284015851370995
in one of those halts he heard the steps of several horses on the road	45.074899032524606
he had no doubt it was the cardinal and his escort	43.72065247558482
he immediately made a new point in advance rubbed his horse down with some heath	724.6163466807684
who goes there cried he as soon as he perceived the horsemen	56.675097627432386
that is our brave musketeer i think said the cardinal	136.97146575432308
yes monseigneur said porthos it is he	37.61688763382019
monsieur athos said richelieu receive my thanks for the good guard you have kept	113.70737621450616
gentlemen we are arrived take the gate on the left	141.182207466922
the watchword is king and r	227.99945157341233
saying these words the cardinal saluted the three friends with an inclination of	65.21478548374752
well said porthos and aramis together as soon as the cardinal was out of hearing	59.864600959912195
i know it said athos coolly since here it is	53.297971156356276
and the three friends did not exchange another word till they reached their quar	79.98974213721209
only they sent mousqueton to tell planchet that his master was requested the ins	67.53345598800978
milady as athos had foreseen on finding the two men that awaited her made no dif	173.32063506021998
she had had for an instant an inclination to be reconducted to the cardinal and 	98.16225386972027
she might say that athos had hanged her but then athos would tell that she was b	122.63520248807944
she thought it was best to preserve silence to discreetly set off to accomplish 	750.4071749654909
in consequence after having traveled all night at seven oclock she was at the fo	127.94636304534701
chapter xlvi	2.634917008110275
the bastion saintgervais	3080.3801812873935
on arriving at the lodgings of his three friends dartagnan found them assembled 	164.78686005528553
athos was meditating porthos was twisting his mustache aramis was saying his pra	208.1760573936357
pardieu gentlemen said he	48.31536767958811
i hope what you have to tell me is worth the trouble or else i warn you i will n	43.961624771640565
ah why were you not there gentlemen it was warm work	319.94249281274733
we were in a place where it was not very cold replied porthos giving his mustach	48.611997531819085
hush said athos	3.599722389834504
oh oh said dartagnan comprehending the slight frown of the musketeer	195.8064730585316
it appears there is something fresh aboard	929.0372954589421
aramis said athos you went to breakfast the day before yesterday at the inn of t	30.504023733987847
how did you fare	298.84098058030077
for my part i ate but little	298.6173416828475
the day before yesterday was a fish day and they had nothing but meat	323.33807393175954
what said athos no fish at a seaport	776.8447595414492
they say said aramis resuming his pious reading that the dyke which the cardinal	150.18709671878125
but that is not quite what i mean to ask you aramis replied athos	27.362725122257892
i want to know if you were left alone and nobody interrupted you	170.03153909639042
why i think there were not many intruders	107.8942808741739
yes athos i know what you mean we shall do very well at the parpaillot	34.31995708144625
let us go to the parpaillot then for here the walls are like sheets of paper	71.20927612962794
dartagnan who was accustomed to his friends manner of acting and who perceived i	116.70114782914747
porthos followed chatting with aramis	337.562165422297
on their way they met grimaud	54.054026410498174
athos made him a sign to come with them	31.813450546153646
grimaud according to custom obeyed in silence the poor lad had nearly come to th	170.18403286709886
they arrived at the drinking room of the parpaillot	62.71444264679499
it was seven oclock in the morning and daylight began to appear	50.60686737689871
the three friends ordered breakfast and went into a room in which the host said 	152.74355945423042
unfortunately the hour was badly chosen for a private conference	383.2068875989586
the morning drum had just been beaten everyone shook off the drowsiness of night	1718.291414501411
dragoons swiss guardsmen musketeers lighthorsemen succeeded one another with a r	215.17104243474805
thus they applied very curtly to the salutations healths and jokes of their comp	286.1967840336566
i see how it will be said athos we shall get into some pretty quarrel or other a	74.98366418389415
dartagnan tell us what sort of a night you have had and we will describe ours af	131.37778530889963
ah yes said a lighthorseman with a glass of brandy in his hand which he sipped s	104.5858433447575
i hear you gentlemen of the guards have been in the trenches tonight and that yo	73.02163365977896
dartagnan looked at athos to know if he ought to reply to this intruder who thus	113.22065863962716
well said athos do nt you hear monsieur de busigny who does you the honor to ask	21.774062568088137
have you not taken a bastion said a swiss who was drinking rum out of a beer gla	147.6941956286429
yes monsieur said dartagnan bowing we have had that honor	74.5621577729469
we even have as you may have heard introduced a barrel of powder under one of th	195.79377544915982
without reckoning that as the bastion was not built yesterday all the rest of th	161.9566058117493
and what bastion is it asked a dragoon with his saber run through a goose which 	178.1967911469755
the bastion st	4116.272753954667
gervais replied dartagnan from behind which the rochellais annoyed our workmen	646.1389022707543
was that affair hot	3235.1235417996154
yes moderately so	453099.3306753535
we lost five men and the rochellais eight or ten	114.20854760727157
balzempleu said the swiss who notwithstanding the admirable collection of oaths 	466.8210650287998
but it is probable said the lighthorseman that they will send pioneers this morn	330.0540156217445
yes that s probable said dartagnan	46.30731633114655
gentlemen said athos a wager	59.946211505612695
ah wooi a vager cried the swiss	32.54821475221185
what is it said the lighthorseman	8.59845861441823
stop a bit said the dragoon placing his saber like a spit upon the two large iro	249.8150786374326
you cursed host a dripping pan immediately that i may not lose a drop of the fat	1014.8511926400595
you was right said the swiss goose grease is kood with basdry	35.47298292254497
there said the dragoon	586.6762268158712
now for the wager we listen monsieur athos	346.444960160283
yes the wager said the lighthorseman	145.52107630934938
well monsieur de busigny i will bet you said athos that my three companions mess	55.32598676450413
gervais and we will remain there an hour by the watch whatever the enemy may do 	133.53210631246577
porthos and aramis looked at each other they began to comprehend	20.162543848308516
but said dartagnan in the ear of athos you are going to get us all killed withou	36.37154421068467
we are much more likely to be killed said athos if we do not go	28.141073669811217
my faith gentlemen said porthos turning round upon his chair and twisting his mu	72.2130750419951
i take it said m	57.16355570553858
de busigny so let us fix the stake	207.57537324757197
you are four gentlemen said athos and we are four an unlimited dinner for eight	103.67797601970481
will that do	290.61682687959734
capitally replied m	131.82690729831666
de busigny	1.0456674114853182
perfectly said the dragoon	485.5661884767113
that shoots me said the swiss	678.3318557915667
the fourth auditor who during all this conversation had played a mute part made 	1047.8416965888773
the breakfast for these gentlemen is ready said the host	117.88758744148726
well bring it said athos	54.915936298417755
the host obeyed	309.6014295059423
athos called grimaud pointed to a large basket which lay in a corner and made a 	145.06257806298473
grimaud understood that it was to be a breakfast on the grass took the basket pa	141.26382400702457
but where are you going to eat my breakfast asked the host	28.884623173343766
what matter if you are paid for it said athos and he threw two pistoles majestic	126.42330617336603
shall i give you the change my officer said the host	68.06452302853418
no only add two bottles of champagne and the difference will be for the napkins	157.90650789095645
the host had not quite so good a bargain as he at first hoped for but he made am	253.33248042484047
monsieur de busigny said athos will you be so kind as to set your watch with min	22.39735755336247
which you please monsieur said the lighthorseman drawing from his fob a very han	44.33688503181699
thirtyfive minutes after seven said athos by which you perceive i am five minute	203.6176815321792
and bowing to all the astonished persons present the young men took the road to 	131.14294836574615
gervais followed by grimaud who carried the basket ignorant of where he was goin	178.35337621235297
as long as they were within the circle of the camp the four friends did not exch	32.754242869028744
but when once they passed the line of circumvallation and found themselves in th	44.539692517225006
and now my dear athos said he do me the kindness to tell me where we are going	31.105461456917375
why you see plainly enough we are going to the bastion	109.12670640361996
but what are we going to do there	13.083654297014194
you know well that we go to breakfast there	58.03845036043178
but why did we not breakfast at the parpaillot	31.445136637366893
because we have very important matters to communicate to one another and it was 	116.245230856755
here at least said athos pointing to the bastion they will not come and disturb 	83.89299054796174
it appears to me said dartagnan with that prudence which allied itself in him so	77.19406196097783
where we should have been seen all four conferring together so that at the end o	127.33249775870198
yes said aramis athos is right animadvertuntur in desertis	24.8608556956886
a desert would not have been amiss said porthos but it behooved us to find it	97.48579439283954
there is no desert where a bird can not pass over ones head where a fish can not	228.83681416746796
better then pursue our enterprise from which besides we can not retreat without 	391.3234270139999
we have made a wagera wager which could not have been foreseen and of which i de	167.3747722201699
we are going in order to win it to remain an hour in the bastion	91.67021675349655
either we shall be attacked or not	105.29951920229635
if we are not we shall have all the time to talk and nobody will hear usfor i gu	70.91140047765717
moreover in defending ourselves we shall cover ourselves with glory	1030.6808990042573
you see that everything is to our advantage	106.74522979642798
yes said dartagnan but we shall indubitably attract a ball	73.11605530446263
well my dear replied athos you know well that the balls most to be dreaded are n	116.01747049783373
but for such an expedition we surely ought to have brought our muskets	363.527327554227
you are stupid friend porthos	282.9473423376938
why should we load ourselves with a useless burden	691.6269802327613
i do nt find a good musket twelve cartridges and a powder flask very useless in 	1342.3992327887267
well replied athos have you not heard what dartagnan said	37.129182393193524
what did he say demanded porthos	28.272433132171134
dartagnan said that in the attack of last night eight or ten frenchmen were kill	221.18368101419122
what then	79.40882199794096
the bodies were not plundered were they it appears the conquerors had something 	579.9385743389689
well we shall find their muskets their cartridges and their flasks and instead o	729.5811817752573
oh athos said aramis truly you are a great man	45.333937294283594
porthos nodded in sign of agreement	980.5475248744029
dartagnan alone did not seem convinced	333.3966251017406
grimaud no doubt shared the misgivings of the young man for seeing that they con	161.89622561249828
where are we going asked he by a gesture	36.73802991970055
athos pointed to the bastion	412.25465555949415
but said grimaud in the same silent dialect we shall leave our skins there	173.86223043486723
athos raised his eyes and his finger toward heaven	60.28486272273745
grimaud put his basket on the ground and sat down with a shake of the head	61.724865915811634
athos took a pistol from his belt looked to see if it was properly primed cocked	123.19369790509919
grimaud was on his legs again as if by a spring	74.03579854776225
athos then made him a sign to take up his basket and to walk on first	161.32619688294434
grimaud obeyed	539.2777536297477
all that grimaud gained by this momentary pantomime was to pass from the rear gu	230.56408956607018
arrived at the bastion the four friends turned round	88.73355732664582
more than three hundred soldiers of all kinds were assembled at the gate of the 	51.707083699749106
de busigny the dragoon the swiss and the fourth bettor	103.59638680839473
athos took off his hat placed it on the end of his sword and waved it in the air	34.888305252224114
all the spectators returned him his salute accompanying this courtesy with a lou	327.4816109864338
chapter xlvii	2.578206400637415
the council of the musketeers	177.3151972967543
as athos had foreseen the bastion was only occupied by a dozen corpses french an	275.1503502767447
gentlemen said athos who had assumed the command of the expedition while grimaud	51.50862834599913
we can talk while performing that necessary task	1578.168612294496
these gentlemen added he pointing to the bodies can not hear us	226.93681936060895
but we could throw them into the ditch said porthos after having assured ourselv	108.12630324480472
yes said athos that s grimauds business	49.75967247968195
well then cried dartagnan pray let grimaud search them and throw them over the w	72.73192032967933
heaven forfend said athos they may serve us	42.08683096514448
these bodies serve us said porthos	270.3644930324259
you are mad dear friend	69.73313757602227
judge not rashly say the gospel and the cardinal replied athos	443.23622158523057
how many guns gentlemen	1197.9162306863648
twelve replied aramis	31.69246660766892
how many shots	697.6393735677086
a hundred	59.60440340882556
that s quite as many as we shall want	108.71836786449289
let us load the guns	505.07076266529214
the four musketeers went to work and as they were loading the last musket grimau	119.45667330776776
athos replied always by gestures that that was well and indicated to grimaud by 	257.54333368380065
only to alleviate the tediousness of the duty athos allowed him to take a loaf t	90.29178778537522
and now to table said athos	38.64604557555052
the four friends seated themselves on the ground with their legs crossed like tu	66.37209666508704
and now said dartagnan as there is no longer any fear of being overheard i hope 	71.09314218469963
i hope at the same time to procure you amusement and glory gentlemen said athos	124.63885300770097
i have induced you to take a charming promenade here is a delicious breakfast an	540.4701780191498
but the secret said dartagnan	43.00749804241563
the secret is said athos that i saw milady last night	70.86478741478449
dartagnan was lifting a glass to his lips but at the name of milady his hand tre	57.168952986399525
you saw your wi	232.17472548559965
hush interrupted athos	47.97372143486336
you forget my dear you forget that these gentlemen are not initiated into my fam	208.59239804213982
i have seen milady	28.145596138302896
where demanded dartagnan	244.09375538382275
within two leagues of this place at the inn of the red dovecot	84.31801850971888
in that case i am lost said dartagnan	17.471602839654427
not so bad yet replied athos for by this time she must have quit the shores of f	103.51732981962682
dartagnan breathed again	932.097692712898
but after all asked porthos who is milady	76.31284336904692
a charming woman said athos sipping a glass of sparkling wine	225.92966023311428
villainous host cried he he has given us anjou wine instead of champagne and fan	482.7125900417775
what by demanding my head of the cardinal cried dartagnan pale with terror	153.96400562201922
yes that is true as the gospel said porthos i heard her with my own ears	70.01184059624964
i also said aramis	50.270370974392655
then said dartagnan letting his arm fall with discouragement it is useless to st	100.03095791762928
i may as well blow my brains out and all will be over	182.10312626790088
that s the last folly to be committed said athos seeing it is the only one for w	68.90360191829531
but i can never escape said dartagnan with such enemies	89.27709813326888
first my stranger of meung then de wardes to whom i have given three sword wound	289.3833460106788
well said athos that only makes four and we are fourone for one	86.75872159813439
pardieu if we may believe the signs grimaud is making we are about to have to do	97.12606271632848
what is it grimaud considering the gravity of the occasion i permit you to speak	98.93460307455022
what do you see	9.55468110360445
a troop	2844.9817169666344
of how many persons	188.39110457882904
twenty men	40.05522865657733
what sort of men	113.24176984407983
sixteen pioneers four soldiers	21953.464887811762
how far distant	27597.857754197747
five hundred paces	79.80093316717748
good we have just time to finish this fowl and to drink one glass of wine to you	150.5049726139838
to your health repeated porthos and aramis	49.330810312620216
well then to my health although i am very much afraid that your good wishes will	71.88717290866467
bah said athos god is great as say the followers of mohammed and the future is i	71.44616745922715
then swallowing the contents of his glass which he put down close to him athos a	92.12348819725334
porthos aramis and dartagnan followed his example	36.65679228815286
as to grimaud he received orders to place himself behind the four friends in ord	61.834246367029365
pardieu said athos it was hardly worth while to distribute ourselves for twenty 	182.14993555956028
grimaud had only to make them a sign to go away and i am convinced they would ha	80.85876655456444
i doubt that replied dartagnan for they are advancing very resolutely	215.15134383919872
besides in addition to the pioneers there are four soldiers and a brigadier arme	306.6342151845004
that s because they do nt see us said athos	33.01970176024354
my faith said aramis i must confess i feel a great repugnance to fire on these p	70.21641711244264
he is a bad priest said porthos who has pity for heretics	45.39813086903384
in truth said athos aramis is right	24.459661691511442
i will warn them	154.2648633063074
what the devil are you going to do cried dartagnan you will be shot	21.312047596925403
but athos heeded not his advice	140.1458543032314
mounting on the breach with his musket in one hand and his hat in the other he s	105.27175633277231
now you know nothing is more disagreeable than being disturbed when one is at br	123.74281715816672
we request you then if you really have business here to wait till we have finish	218.76208133114287
take care athos cried dartagnan do nt you see they are aiming	91.95434552864428
yes yes said athos but they are only civiliansvery bad marksmen who will be sure	45.62292135933875
in fact at the same instant four shots were fired and the balls were flattened a	51.55921245560477
four shots replied to them almost instantaneously but much better aimed than tho	1260.1681151935295
grimaud said athos still on the breach another musket	408.61699802448214
grimaud immediately obeyed	4024.4411461419495
on their part the three friends had reloaded their arms a second discharge follo	119.63355529915772
the brigadier and two pioneers fell dead the rest of the troop took to flight	557.9358671591306
now gentlemen a sortie cried athos	235.9874193553948
and the four friends rushed out of the fort gained the field of battle picked up	85.54086027152819
reload the muskets grimaud said athos and we gentlemen will go on with our break	166.7447396599555
where were we	45.82643232520832
i recollect you were saying said dartagnan that after having demanded my head of	99.26647335837389
whither goes she added he strongly interested in the route milady followed	526.4978628973615
she goes into england said athos	38.38539100898238
with what view	1179.584411045115
with the view of assassinating or causing to be assassinated the duke of bucking	140.7540909297449
dartagnan uttered an exclamation of surprise and indignation	58.465933542773236
but this is infamous cried he	162.82409408352007
as to that said athos i beg you to believe that i care very little about it	48.53329564611892
now you have done grimaud take our brigadiers halfpike tie a napkin to it and pl	287.0143085695531
grimaud obeyed without replying	440.43183116409244
an instant afterward the white flag was floating over the heads of the four frie	208.13953068121367
a thunder of applause saluted its appearance half the camp was at the barrier	357.5524260515775
how replied dartagnan you care little if she kills buckingham or causes him to b	573.4718719130876
the duke is english the duke fights against us	483.35751131643326
let her do what she likes with the duke i care no more about him than an empty b	243.3034489392947
and athos threw fifteen paces from him an empty bottle from which he had poured 	150.08257551484496
a moment said dartagnan	21.998176178623808
i will not abandon buckingham thus	99.91873869451017
he gave us some very fine horses	225.05302915543592
and moreover very handsome saddles said porthos who at the moment wore on his cl	200.59379222580355
besides said aramis god desires the conversion and not the death of a sinner	356.3653737664728
amen said athos and we will return to that subject later if such be your pleasur	79.48364074992787
but this creature must be a demon said porthos holding out his plate to aramis w	52.03191750278679
and this carte blanche said dartagnan this carte blanche does it remain in her h	68.46725163788965
no it passed into mine i will not say without trouble for if i did i should tell	103.07776895815977
my dear athos i shall no longer count the number of times i am indebted to you f	50.59766214811527
then it was to go to her that you left us said aramis	51.96036291972955
and you have that letter of the cardinal said dartagnan	30.400555991702742
here it is said athos and he took the invaluable paper from the pocket of his un	42.01713041343842
dartagnan unfolded it with one hand whose trembling he did not even attempt to c	139.19852686926
3 1627	11.156686915633843
it is by my order and for the good of the state that the bearer of this has done	89.66456304447492
in fact said aramis it is an absolution according to rule	258.036257785599
that paper must be torn to pieces said dartagnan who fancied he read in it his s	172.51605143958867
on the contrary said athos it must be preserved carefully	62.14917741543574
i would not give up this paper if covered with as many gold pieces	294.8137113419085
and what will she do now asked the young man	18.961899725662263
why replied athos carelessly she is probably going to write to the cardinal that	74.05055668076373
the cardinal will remember that these are the same men who have often crossed hi	127.90640801021387
go to it appears to me you make dull jokes my dear said porthos	170.42725096041772
i do not jest said athos	24.844454369834782
do you know said porthos that to twist that damned miladys neck would be a small	80.76462795418315
what says the abb asked athos quietly	88.10740952627727
i say i am entirely of porthoss opinion replied aramis	40.45542683759712
and i too said dartagnan	15.590725318534199
fortunately she is far off said porthos for i confess she would worry me if she 	110.65661697877863
she worries me in england as well as in france said athos	106.34483896744406
she worries me everywhere said dartagnan	1246.3463736138765
but when you held her in your power why did you not drown her strangle her hang 	315.38397205643264
it is only the dead who do not return	47.21881124361199
you think so porthos replied the musketeer with a sad smile which dartagnan alon	31.89128342302382
i have an idea said dartagnan	24.15387121255903
what is it said the musketeers	30.881717346362354
to arms cried grimaud	292.4898836944514
the young men sprang up and seized their muskets	86.39036323566478
this time a small troop advanced consisting of from twenty to twentyfive men but	431.85894637730036
shall we return to the camp said porthos	19.576146868960638
i do nt think the sides are equal	214.88497444584496
impossible for three reasons replied athos	92.78556521811595
the first that we have not finished breakfast the second that we still have some	151.0287717118348
well then said aramis we must form a plan of battle	44.74641473818552
that s very simple replied athos	27.588947439438908
as soon as the enemy are within musket shot we must fire upon them	329.0533269895442
if they continue to advance we must fire again	218.5280219524902
we must fire as long as we have loaded guns	161.50491873378803
if those who remain of the troop persist in coming to the assault we will allow 	557.2860329993964
bravo cried porthos	6.399254520070811
decidedly athos you were born to be a general and the cardinal who fancies himse	58.785513435548474
gentlemen said athos no divided attention i beg let each one pick out his man	439.58335182229143
i cover mine said dartagnan	478.77775612052756
and i mine said porthos	54.25223759269703
and i idem said aramis	629.9161286310026
fire then said athos	22.62244373604872
the four muskets made but one report but four men fell	533.7852124062646
the drum immediately beat and the little troop advanced at charging pace	3438.884327175044
then the shots were repeated without regularity but always aimed with the same a	476.4352218182481
nevertheless as if they had been aware of the numerical weakness of the friends 	47.98476020725278
with every three shots at least two men fell but the march of those who remained	200.40172223589693
arrived at the foot of the bastion there were still more than a dozen of the ene	42.44304183058344
a last discharge welcomed them but did not stop them they jumped into the ditch 	477.6143902023985
now my friends said athos finish them at a blow	96.51977646455796
to the wall to the wall	54.22735685729231
and the four friends seconded by grimaud pushed with the barrels of their musket	223.14539680814502
then a fearful crash was heard a cloud of dust mounted toward the skyand all was	115.13520131727508
can we have destroyed them all from the first to the last said athos	69.56654810366545
my faith it appears so said dartagnan	71.09910880899777
no cried porthos there go three or four limping away	193.53162597712412
in fact three or four of these unfortunate men covered with dirt and blood fled 	492.84317548140723
these were all who were left of the little troop	116.2450091367843
athos looked at his watch	11.14579437439458
gentlemen said he we have been here an hour and our wager is won but we will be 	81.71190217393627
besides dartagnan has not told us his idea yet	168.61239789060662
and the musketeer with his usual coolness reseated himself before the remains of	161.45910336326202
my idea said dartagnan	37.95998372837336
yes you said you had an idea said athos	93.12242663583335
oh i remember said dartagnan	17.646850194122134
well i will go to england a second time i will go and find buckingham	17.59202557999529
you shall not do that dartagnan said athos coolly	53.45551901755785
and why not have i not been there once	153.42380795362132
yes but at that period we were not at war	71.0868031950202
at that period buckingham was an ally and not an enemy	260.007859825514
what you would now do amounts to treason	724.4211519162126
dartagnan perceived the force of this reasoning and was silent	170.65690086161578
but said porthos i think i have an idea in my turn	19.980474196863113
silence for monsieur porthoss idea said aramis	140.75838646925567
i will ask leave of absence of monsieur de trville on some pretext or other whic	98.3530857041537
milady does not know me i will get access to her without her suspecting me and w	95.94174718393899
well replied athos i am not far from approving the idea of monsieur porthos	94.05919627466764
for shame said aramis	62.65033012320384
kill a woman no listen to me i have the true idea	136.53580336086762
let us see your idea aramis said athos who felt much deference for the young mus	69.70185507339927
we must inform the queen	43.710417486619946
ah my faith yes said porthos and dartagnan at the same time we are coming nearer	28.349922059034192
inform the queen said athos and how have we relations with the court could we se	83.44344221093998
as to remitting a letter with safety to her majesty said aramis coloring i will 	216.6395393279519
i know a clever person at tours	116.60580707691557
aramis stopped on seeing athos smile	195.5039152714779
well do you not adopt this means athos said dartagnan	53.26750793624834
i do not reject it altogether said athos but i wish to remind aramis that he can	61.9427277838458
without reckoning objected porthos that the queen would save monsieur de bucking	137.91882757132697
gentlemen said dartagnan what porthos says is full of sense	93.4660373198492
ah ah but what s going on in the city yonder said athos	88.22377797647783
they are beating the general alarm	610.5202173144256
the four friends listened and the sound of the drum plainly reached them	302.6812706493455
you see they are going to send a whole regiment against us said athos	76.02170751595379
you do nt think of holding out against a whole regiment do you said porthos	159.61526152209873
why not said the musketeer	66.26928650866
i feel myself quite in a humor for it and i would hold out before an army if we 	126.44277918853383
upon my word the drum draws near said dartagnan	472.3810137579222
let it come said athos	33.106239379764624
it is a quarter of an hours journey from here to the city consequently a quarter	108.93263003529013
that is more than time enough for us to devise a plan	176.474902852126
if we go from this place we shall never find another so suitable	200.32930161193408
ah stop i have it gentlemen the right idea has just occurred to me	129.53192350980854
tell us	25.02130135245361
allow me to give grimaud some indispensable orders	298.1654474529494
athos made a sign for his lackey to approach	42.05010145925198
grimaud said athos pointing to the bodies which lay under the wall of the bastio	43.5712847563963
oh the great man cried dartagnan	40.55430596536823
i comprehend now	3482.986416735381
you comprehend said porthos	196.79192075368437
and do you comprehend grimaud said aramis	26.719145369014573
grimaud made a sign in the affirmative	11.439933644434598
that s all that is necessary said athos now for my idea	66.48197679674958
i should like however to comprehend said porthos	102.63464209870256
that is useless	34.6163071129686
yes yes athoss idea cried aramis and dartagnan at the same time	33.46438819374454
this milady this woman this creature this demon has a brotherinlaw as i think yo	343.9607439663925
yes i know him very well and i also believe that he has not a very warm affectio	37.59542301575642
there is no harm in that	16.40748834201644
if he detested her it would be all the better replied athos	95.07907917178541
in that case we are as well off as we wish	47.52105683044486
and yet said porthos i would like to know what grimaud is about	34.934225963882064
silence porthos said aramis	10.267793538511564
what is her brotherinlaws name	474.05305974895526
lord de winter	14.560085715791876
where is he now	21.406430716120042
he returned to london at the first sound of war	43.72107985412313
well there s just the man we want said athos	77.16517230551071
it is he whom we must warn	106.15267291489899
we will have him informed that his sisterinlaw is on the point of having someone	161.78440414846875
there is in london i hope some establishment like that of the magdalens or of th	68.72005149831257
he must place his sister in one of these and we shall be in peace	105.74275571216656
yes said dartagnan till she comes out	79.84363899052464
ah my faith said athos you require too much dartagnan	59.55499874276703
i have given you all i have and i beg leave to tell you that this is the bottom 	49.16588625048903
but i think it would be still better said aramis to inform the queen and lord de	37.65531961629429
yes but who is to carry the letter to tours and who to london	55.99999068260195
i answer for bazin said aramis	30.120764563670836
and i for planchet said dartagnan	33.32026408122228
ay said porthos if we can not leave the camp our lackeys may	63.578937111756225
to be sure they may and this very day we will write the letters said aramis	95.55827318652884
give the lackeys money and they will start	272.2114907637882
we will give them money replied athos	38.214751910941686
have you any money	7.399423854386232
the four friends looked at one another and a cloud came over the brows which but	70.73336121527178
look out cried dartagnan i see black points and red points moving yonder	773.0807238547482
why did you talk of a regiment athos it is a veritable army	65.46391038894045
my faith yes said athos there they are	44.914532665375454
see the sneaks come without drum or trumpet	957.6692137291408
ah ah have you finished grimaud	127.20645125518482
grimaud made a sign in the affirmative and pointed to a dozen bodies which he ha	50.722902521726255
some carried arms others seemed to be taking aim and the remainder appeared mere	1225.6406051737545
bravo said athos that does honor to your imagination	125.9163778921402
all very well said porthos but i should like to understand	29.06138381989753
let us decamp first and you will understand afterward	836.8874541635197
a moment gentlemen a moment give grimaud time to clear away the breakfast	554.5905823887707
ah ah said aramis the black points and the red points are visibly enlarging	510.1301405251903
i am of dartagnans opinion we have no time to lose in regaining our camp	98.56087724155807
my faith said athos i have nothing to say against a retreat	40.34365716464009
we bet upon one hour and we have stayed an hour and a half	188.75887547227964
nothing can be said let us be off gentlemen let us be off	72.9953149160904
grimaud was already ahead with the basket and the dessert	827.1606905054074
the four friends followed ten paces behind him	57.337396586875414
what the devil shall we do now gentlemen cried athos	58.51783888540038
have you forgotten anything said aramis	19.91276814290648
the white flag morbleu we must not leave a flag in the hands of the enemy even i	664.2443468348929
and athos ran back to the bastion mounted the platform and bore off the flag but	344.1328369170458
but athos might be said to bear a charmed life	273.7751288177297
the balls passed and whistled all around him not one struck him	681.1686389769345
athos waved his flag turning his back on the guards of the city and saluting tho	254.26797462724943
on both sides loud cries aroseon the one side cries of anger on the other cries 	299.6570416163493
a second discharge followed the first and three balls by passing through it made	698.0889425283357
cries were heard from the camp come down come down	172.7988531707336
athos came down his friends who anxiously awaited him saw him returned with joy	190.12977971260185
come along athos come along cried dartagnan now we have found everything except 	184.7296727352216
but athos continued to march majestically whatever remarks his companions made a	859.7948721377184
grimaud and his basket were far in advance out of the range of the balls	236.44021402756673
at the end of an instant they heard a furious fusillade	88.22912082195126
what s that asked porthos what are they firing at now i hear no balls whistle an	331.71668121048276
they are firing at the corpses replied athos	278.8620674087718
but the dead can not return their fire	252.67871923699082
certainly not they will then fancy it is an ambuscade they will deliberate and b	146.8582884540862
that renders it useless to get a pleurisy by too much haste	296.4073796753197
oh i comprehend now said the astonished porthos	118.98210487117082
that s lucky said athos shrugging his shoulders	39.64068785802299
on their part the french on seeing the four friends return at such a step uttere	76.80783755171606
at length a fresh discharge was heard and this time the balls came rattling amon	150.5712275464499
the rochellais had at last taken possession of the bastion	110.64923009919637
these rochellais are bungling fellows said athos how many have we killed of them	101.86920143271753
or fifteen	168.3982662256137
how many did we crush under the wall	180.11094066257678
eight or ten	17.910261751595687
and in exchange for all that not even a scratch ah but what is the matter with y	85.83770667171578
oh its nothing said dartagnan	146.12574328372045
a spent ball	12721.392039123597
not even that	88.20640544803955
what is it then	8.56730958031605
we have said that athos loved dartagnan like a child and this somber and inflexi	52.76842800034967
only grazed a little replied dartagnan my fingers were caught between two stones	207.35506256105265
that comes of wearing diamonds my master said athos disdainfully	340.5584977004891
ah to be sure cried porthos there is a diamond	38.47045033464249
why the devil then do we plague ourselves about money when there is a diamond	175.19067602282942
stop a bit said aramis	39.41505477911163
well thought of porthos this time you have an idea	61.77710163295731
undoubtedly said porthos drawing himself up at athoss compliment as there is a d	96.54214682548054
but said dartagnan it is the queens diamond	70.96650356366679
the stronger reason why it should be sold replied athos	234.59731318359388
the queen saving monsieur de buckingham her lover nothing more just	590.4149055892126
the queen saving us her friends nothing more moral	3428.353369418912
let us sell the diamond	83.0146284019478
what says monsieur the abb i do nt ask porthos his opinion has been given	72.32296820975603
why i think said aramis blushing as usual that his ring not coming from a mistre	87.0410322464638
my dear aramis you speak like theology personified	1918.2714688090118
your advice then is	151.50200942566656
to sell the diamond replied aramis	86.90110899389195
well then said dartagnan gaily let us sell the diamond and say no more about it	67.95491113870327
the fusillade continued but the four friends were out of reach and the rochellai	213.83461812483486
my faith it was time that idea came into porthoss head	195.88276941355315
here we are at the camp therefore gentlemen not a word more of this affair	135.76052480115533
we are observed they are coming to meet us	48.67919641488598
we shall be carried in triumph	86.94844370884836
in fact as we have said the whole camp was in motion	110.0619738527614
more than two thousand persons had assisted as at a spectacle in this fortunate 	368.8979607814315
nothing was heard but cries of live the musketeers live the guards m	616.0692611060782
de busigny was the first to come and shake athos by the hand and acknowledge tha	64.91501895597773
the dragoon and the swiss followed him and all their comrades followed the drago	121.05616783294874
there was nothing but felicitations pressures of the hand and embraces there was	693.9718200191768
the tumult at length became so great that the cardinal fancied there must be som	138.25694371097555
the affair was described to the messenger with all the effervescence of enthusia	75.80209673476885
well asked the cardinal on seeing la houdinire return	123.41418247298151
well monseigneur replied the latter three musketeers and a guardsman laid a wage	436.0589260517224
gervais and while breakfasting they held it for two hours against the enemy and 	210.17278003985206
did you inquire the names of those three musketeers	61.504045606258465
yes monseigneur	15212.55171473829
what are their names	125.65492833363535
messieurs athos porthos and aramis	7.6038690094998405
still my three brave fellows murmured the cardinal	215.0661066468836
and the guardsman	23.285624789387022
still my young scapegrace	75.8822731398873
positively these four men must be on my side	62.136198624554666
the same evening the cardinal spoke to m	59.880931307934794
de trville of the exploit of the morning which was the talk of the whole camp	128.06825720418848
de trville who had received the account of the adventure from the mouths of the 	43.00568316048639
that s well monsieur de trville said the cardinal pray let that napkin be sent t	90.7577158698043
i will have three fleurdelis embroidered on it in gold and will give it to your 	236.31949658813815
monseigneur said m	42.18394424345247
de trville that will be unjust to the guardsmen	31.468026128005597
monsieur dartagnan is not with me he serves under monsieur dessessart	131.6603080241782
well then take him said the cardinal when four men are so much attached to one a	64.84534820279413
that same evening m	603.2500751443862
de trville announced this good news to the three musketeers and dartagnan inviti	55.38476954017356
dartagnan was beside himself with joy	87.7930430928941
we know that the dream of his life had been to become a musketeer	75.49361191646433
the three friends were likewise greatly delighted	692.4945508782713
my faith said dartagnan to athos you had a triumphant idea as you said we have a	57.718417948644436
which we can resume now without anybody suspecting us for with the help of god w	306.52296606907777
that evening dartagnan went to present his respects to m	112.07514868526209
dessessart and inform him of his promotion	236.44077774563743
dessessart who esteemed dartagnan made him offers of help as this change would e	362.37382815824736
dartagnan refused but thinking the opportunity a good one he begged him to have 	288.77449118688247
the next day m	73.59603389100452
dessessarts valet came to dartagnans lodging and gave him a bag containing seven	405.69993251226657
this was the price of the queens diamond	83.41018529137841
chapter xlviii	2.2143173616750853
a family affair	4653.893061535128
athos had invented the phrase family affair	2539.3102548533175
a family affair was not subject to the investigation of the cardinal a family af	101.04739040059484
people might employ themselves in a family affair before all the world	221.74876409541278
therefore athos had invented the phrase family affair	1080.9821089382124
aramis had discovered the idea the lackeys	239.7962810409727
porthos had discovered the means the diamond	110.45850296548937
dartagnan alone had discovered nothinghe ordinarily the most inventive of the fo	441.08335680102755
ah no we were mistaken he had discovered a purchaser for his diamond	298.89085921175945
the breakfast at m	577.0721931018631
de trvilles was as gay and cheerful as possible	91.32266932303799
dartagnan already wore his uniformfor being nearly of the same size as aramis an	319.34166430690516
dartagnan would have been at the height of his wishes if he had not constantly s	62.574346893591596
after breakfast it was agreed that they should meet again in the evening at atho	55.81261035991228
dartagnan passed the day in exhibiting his musketeers uniform in every street of	493.55575812894926
in the evening at the appointed hour the four friends met	28.114852316438057
there only remained three things to decidewhat they should write to miladys brot	94.8820213400569
everyone offered his own	394.69795591880523
athos talked of the discretion of grimaud who never spoke a word but when his ma	104.38988680327222
porthos boasted of the strength of mousqueton who was big enough to thrash four 	138.46549308104824
aramis confiding in the address of bazin made a pompous eulogium on his candidat	250.60610133389596
finally dartagnan had entire faith in the bravery of planchet and reminded them 	145.21151094546818
these four virtues disputed the prize for a length of time and gave birth to mag	473.072357297209
unfortunately said athos he whom we send must possess in himself alone the four 	427.5171333956289
but where is such a lackey to be found	111.65535151029081
not to be found cried athos	35.921766192653905
i know it well so take grimaud	81.87563380777449
take mousqueton	32.6164353375603
take bazin	30.426428063209723
take planchet	31.089772904881293
planchet is brave and shrewd they are two qualities out of the four	272.7283273942877
gentlemen said aramis the principal question is not to know which of our four la	141.4503316982536
what aramis says is very sensible replied athos we must speculate upon the fault	250.56224929450843
monsieur abb you are a great moralist	167.1524083566813
doubtless said aramis for we not only require to be well served in order to succ	57.098691932573544
speak lower aramis said athos	106.40129325392509
that s wisenot for the lackeys resumed aramis but for the masterfor the masters 	93.68083449366094
are our lackeys sufficiently devoted to us to risk their lives for us no	326.7347917821467
my faith said dartagnan	22.046875281719824
i would almost answer for planchet	108.6096081314039
well my dear friend add to his natural devotedness a good sum of money and then 	173.142129647097
why good god you will be deceived just the same said athos who was an optimist w	59.20630174494901
they will promise everything for the sake of the money and on the road fear will	88.63481505457285
once taken they will be pressed when pressed they will confess everything	954.8508015070424
what the devil we are not children	81.82875857653704
to reach englandathos lowered his voiceall france covered with spies and creatur	224.0158790634783
a passport for embarkation must be obtained and the party must be acquainted wit	409.2809799397578
really i think the thing very difficult	93.91488712834776
not at all cried dartagnan who was anxious the matter should be accomplished on 	77.57582876707441
it would be no doubt parbleu if we write to lord de winter about affairs of vast	293.616035205576
speak lower said athos	261.15921324263877
of intrigues and secrets of state continued dartagnan complying with the recomme	357.80348173400506
there can be no doubt we would all be broken on the wheel but for gods sake do n	206.7491561278246
i will write to him then nearly in these terms	154.35315962851416
let us see said athos assuming in advance a critical look	119.84143919024365
monsieur and dear friend	172.33936080961186
ah yes dear friend to an englishman interrupted athos well commenced bravo darta	260.93863854459016
well perhaps	944.264360545333
i will say then monsieur quite short	555.6546885247176
you may even say my lord replied athos who stickled for propriety	146.9555888549783
my lord do you remember the little goat pasture of the luxembourg	91.0399280100068
good the luxembourg one might believe this is an allusion to the queenmother tha	84.42249807666828
well then we will put simply my lord do you remember a certain little enclosure 	140.99006977274308
my dear dartagnan you will never make anything but a very bad secretary	79.95824298169065
where your life was spared for shame that s unworthy	662.2064301551403
a man of spirit is not to be reminded of such services	173.36386416143756
a benefit reproached is an offense committed	8347.755363395725
the devil said dartagnan you are insupportable	48.21274786351048
if the letter must be written under your censure my faith i renounce the task	842.0869171479869
and you will do right	44.91815227037927
handle the musket and the sword my dear fellow	109.68292341795868
you will come off splendidly at those two exercises but pass the pen over to mon	584.8570477376734
that s his province	1188.1247831898115
ay ay said porthos pass the pen to aramis who writes theses in latin	50.70296461870823
well so be it said dartagnan	47.76897642368741
draw up this note for us aramis but by our holy father the pope cut it short for	275.62741992613843
i ask no better said aramis with that ingenious air of confidence which every po	135.6700545024325
i have heard here and there that this sisterinlaw was a hussy	177.65694101672895
i have obtained proof of it by listening to her conversation with the cardinal	131.96325817508043
lower sacr bleu said athos	9.788878561152147
but continued aramis the details escape me	398.117150987784
and me also said porthos	84.75291839180721
dartagnan and athos looked at each other for some time in silence	16.38396370901551
at length athos after serious reflection and becoming more pale than usual made 	559.1642148186337
well this is what you have to say said dartagnan my lord your sisterinlaw is an 	41.59994600558598
repudiated by her husband said athos	57.78858735298514
because she had been branded continued dartagnan	582.3261119259196
bah cried porthos	6.123099013792879
impossible what do you saythat she wanted to have her brotherinlaw killed	153.39374289086157
she was married asked aramis	86.04149611447518
and her husband found out that she had a fleurdelis on her shoulder cried portho	311.2107730245841
these three yeses had been pronounced by athos each with a sadder intonation	335.6452575103442
and who has seen this fleurdelis inquired aramis	380.2666317688543
dartagnan and i	31.205197253370173
or rather to observe the chronological order i and dartagnan replied athos	81.58237414178618
and does the husband of this frightful creature still live said aramis	240.04064377261955
he still lives	443.90777081911574
are you quite sure of it	11.25351230147325
i am he	89.16797119688738
there was a moment of cold silence during which everyone was affected according 	118.62351321434629
this time said athos first breaking the silence dartagnan has given us an excell	94.77530727062222
the devil you are right athos said aramis and it is a rather difficult matter	46.98351389585305
the chancellor himself would be puzzled how to write such a letter and yet the c	216.36637517538134
never mind be silent i will write	177.17625078481782
aramis accordingly took the quill reflected for a few moments wrote eight or ten	1149.2912755035368
my lord the person who writes these few lines had the honor of crossing swords w	296.4728264179273
as you have several times since declared yourself the friend of that person he t	203.85715519858505
twice you have nearly been the victim of a near relative whom you believe to be 	132.57801551099462
but the third time which is the present you may succumb	88.6217985834486
your relative left la rochelle for england during the night	302.7904035545286
watch her arrival for she has great and terrible projects	451.828726571989
if you require to know positively what she is capable of read her past history o	333.26009276821304
well now that will do wonderfully well said athos	102.95309838647509
my dear aramis you have the pen of a secretary of state	72.37882305204158
lord de winter will now be upon his guard if the letter should reach him and eve	132.5833891604473
but as the lackey who goes may make us believe he has been to london and may sto	113.40371719196992
have you the diamond continued athos	78.41758095634069
i have what is still better	341.0214639070341
i have the price and dartagnan threw the bag upon the table	66.41236599972078
at the sound of the gold aramis raised his eyes and porthos started	29.415603889530797
as to athos he remained unmoved	84.00759819464456
how much in that little bag	726.4367768475273
seven thousand livres in louis of twelve francs	158.95955023695257
seven thousand livres cried porthos	28.08245479028584
that poor little diamond was worth seven thousand livres	406.6993780287462
it appears so said athos since here they are	68.94688659375132
i do nt suppose that our friend dartagnan has added any of his own to the amount	61.95188480485157
but gentlemen in all this said dartagnan we do not think of the queen	40.19983596078099
let us take some heed of the welfare of her dear buckingham	109.32707133837766
that is the least we owe her	115.14969602553137
that s true said athos but that concerns aramis	36.160449462445605
well replied the latter blushing what must i say	95.86533173767643
oh that s simple enough replied athos	43.59280403876439
write a second letter for that clever personage who lives at tours	252.39934487851698
aramis resumed his pen reflected a little and wrote the following lines which he	105.99097192679396
my dear cousin	561.3588782093987
ah ah said athos	4.783236259552476
this clever person is your relative then	1010.6652415367092
go on to your cousin then	157.6634900048639
aramis continued	151.74327216941884
my dear cousin his eminence the cardinal whom god preserve for the happiness of 	162.7546981990318
it is probable that the succor of the english fleet will never even arrive in si	88.6512574206949
i will even venture to say that i am certain m	54.56293681412592
de buckingham will be prevented from setting out by some great event	215.95367048421213
his eminence is the most illustrious politician of times past of times present a	356.0918942701841
he would extinguish the sun if the sun incommoded him	1562.6052886856492
give these happy tidings to your sister my dear cousin	222.49716926477817
i have dreamed that the unlucky englishman was dead	212.00974331861866
i can not recollect whether it was by steel or by poison only of this i am sure 	155.51496461152735
be assured then of seeing me soon return	503.28787333443523
capital cried athos you are the king of poets my dear aramis	80.92024892166376
you speak like the apocalypse and you are as true as the gospel	100.00110312663561
there is nothing now to do but to put the address to this letter	64.87698776613163
that is easily done said aramis	41.76285320399801
he folded the letter fancifully and took up his pen and wrote	68.46640280217926
to mlle	9.697623593146757
michon seamstress tours	18.572475796597647
the three friends looked at one another and laughed they were caught	89.09346723070654
now said aramis you will please to understand gentlemen that bazin alone can car	72.54768432701292
my cousin knows nobody but bazin and places confidence in nobody but him any oth	1071.0064814054306
besides bazin is ambitious and learned bazin has read history gentlemen he knows	413.8981726017635
well as he means to enter the church at the same time as myself he does not desp	53.713751165947684
you can understand that a man who has such views will never allow himself to be 	76.84703611988422
very well said dartagnan i consent to bazin with all my heart but grant me planc	32.21557457055267
milady had him one day turned out of doors with sundry blows of a good stick to 	441.52926057364346
now planchet has an excellent memory and i will be bound that sooner than relinq	90.94933049004693
if your arrangements at tours are your arrangements aramis those of london are m	157.94672090919926
i request then that planchet may be chosen more particularly as he has already b	170.02659344960756
with that you may be satisfied he can make his way both going and returning	145.66346452099097
in that case said athos planchet must receive seven hundred livres for going and	78.5025451295423
we will each take a thousand livres to be employed as seems good and we will lea	131.1884183416197
will that do	240.37441291523513
my dear athos said aramis you speak like nestor who was as everyone knows the wi	56.15663480876162
well then said athos it is agreed	19.00899323244881
planchet and bazin shall go	37.3252630547435
everything considered i am not sorry to retain grimaud he is accustomed to my wa	73.8996542228673
yesterdays affair must have shaken him a little his voyage would upset him quite	642.4739744164319
planchet was sent for and instructions were given him	182.15323611205318
the matter had been named to him by dartagnan who in the first place pointed out	56.789690341365954
i will carry the letter in the lining of my coat said planchet and if i am taken	49.53121859236361
well but then you will not be able to fulfill your commission said dartagnan	43.16098335098011
you will give me a copy this evening which i shall know by heart tomorrow	98.39258209021858
dartagnan looked at his friends as if to say well what did i tell you	30.926500733993866
now continued he addressing planchet you have eight days to get an interview wit	135.82559973371482
if on the sixteenth day after your departure at eight oclock in the evening you 	81.02523170310668
then monsieur said planchet you must buy me a watch	51.08930364846067
take this said athos with his usual careless generosity giving him his own and b	174.9475838557037
remember if you talk if you babble if you get drunk you risk your masters head w	229.07983955987996
but remember also that if by your fault any evil happens to dartagnan i will fin	148.22213531901687
oh monsieur said planchet humiliated by the suspicion and moreover terrified at 	331.9630508812078
and i said porthos rolling his large eyes remember i will skin you alive	481.52381975977244
ah monsieur	102.93218737682162
and i said aramis with his soft melodius voice remember that i will roast you at	152.37510135825133
ah monsieur	102.9721968923616
planchet began to weep	93.3124038500982
we will not venture to say whether it was from terror created by the threats or 	157.45447843592586
dartagnan took his hand	12.35124062625143
see planchet said he these gentlemen only say this out of affection for me but a	167.1028395217432
ah monsieur said planchet i will succeed or i will consent to be cut in quarters	97.40735953783766
it was decided that planchet should set out the next day at eight oclock in the 	29.73162925504328
he gained just twelve hours by this engagement he was to be back on the sixteent	119.29302153975452
in the morning as he was mounting his horse dartagnan who felt at the bottom of 	46.96806923185564
listen said he to him	16.861343771089423
when you have given the letter to lord de winter and he has read it you will fur	31.41507263385557
but this planchet is so serious and important that i have not informed my friend	71.46211315010879

the four friends exchanged a joyful glance half of the work was done	106.91037551177484
it is true however that it was the shorter and easier part	220.75905069156815
aramis blushing in spite of himself took the letter which was in a large coarse 	78.12053872974163
good god cried he laughing i quite despair of my poor michon she will never writ	123.82728237544391

athos cast a glance over the epistle and to disperse all the suspicions that mig	152.15909672735896

neffer replied the swiss enchanted that a man like athos could envy him anything	253.93331796734736
neffer neffer	14.72401841653546
dartagnan seeing athos rise did likewise took his arm and went out	344.02110614333316
porthos and aramis remained behind to encounter the jokes of the dragoon and the	97.09429697746884

the days of expectation are long and dartagnan in particular would have wagered 	288.9932390677717

you are very fastidious said athos such a beautiful woman	84.5364988474123
a woman of mark said porthos with his loud laugh	148.3998551440078
athos started passed his hand over his brow to remove the drops of perspiration 	107.24005314732095
the day however passed away and the evening came on slowly but finally it came	196.3735684082438
the bars were filled with drinkers	1350.0439384565907
athos who had pocketed his share of the diamond seldom quit the parpaillot	412.71785757448174
he had found in m	115.65761056892657

at half past seven the retreat was sounded	389.60082905767024
we are lost said dartagnan in the ear of athos	20.681605072054186
you mean to say we have lost said athos quietly drawing four pistoles from his p	92.44533778778221
come gentlemen said he they are beating the tattoo	46.62131981859764
let us to bed	77.45296795097536
and athos went out of the parpaillot followed by dartagnan	25.139308751786956
aramis came behind giving his arm to porthos	146.895968076056
aramis mumbled verses to himself and porthos from time to time pulled a hair or 	438.21087861286424
but all at once a shadow appeared in the darkness the outline of which was famil	63.544385352026815
planchet cried dartagnan beside himself with joy	85.77134289252437
planchet repeated aramis and porthos	25.515033464587294
well yes planchet to be sure said athos what is there so astonishing in that he 	47.29343082879028

oh no never said planchet i will never leave monsieur dartagnan	40.37206149485162
at the same time dartagnan felt that planchet slipped a note into his hand	43.298971070397165
dartagnan felt a strong inclination to embrace planchet as he had embraced him o	65.19218200426336
i have the note said he to athos and to his friends	50.45368535386293
that s well said athos let us go home and read it	38.57201809949833
the note burned the hand of dartagnan	190.25611235996718
he wished to hasten their steps but athos took his arm and passed it under his o	64.59679070543254
at length they reached the tent lit a lamp and while planchet stood at the entra	70.95357806493512
it contained half a line in a hand perfectly british and with a conciseness as p	116.83845513795438
thank you be easy	59.36458259132096
dartagnan translated this for the others	470.878970008466
athos took the letter from the hands of dartagnan approached the lamp set fire t	67.08332330973478
then calling planchet he said now my lad you may claim your seven hundred livres	265.6322382405142
i am not to blame for having tried every means to compress it said planchet	92.51426265400764

milady therefore continued her voyage and on the very day that planchet embarked	274.265899527776
all the city was agitated by an extraordinary movement	173.57793669091026
four large vessels recently built had just been launched	1014.6489347564051
at the end of the jetty his clothes richly laced with gold glittering as was cus	316.3162415064082
it was one of those rare and beautiful days in winter when england remembers tha	125.34033944551982
the star of day pale but nevertheless still splendid was setting in the horizon 	971.746606443391
breathing that sea breeze so much more invigorating and balsamic as the land is 	299.6466110022029
they entered the roadstead but as they drew near in order to cast anchor a littl	92.67939710872132
this boat contained an officer a mate and eight rowers	1370.1595556840223
the officer alone went on board where he was received with all the deference ins	126.39732672781395
the officer conversed a few instants with the captain gave him several papers of	668.1446423982165
when this species of summons was made the officer inquired aloud the point of th	404.885733955289
then the officer began to pass in review all the people one after the other and 	107.34129913823153
he then returned to the captain said a few words to him and as if from that mome	38.713910443035196
then the vessel resumed its course still escorted by the little cutter which sai	145.05289441436702
the boat followed in the wake of the ship a speck near the enormous mass	326.8853285637177
during the examination of milady by the officer as may well be imagined milady o	99.55354200583795
but however great was the power of this woman with eyes of flame in reading the 	128.01196515639856
the officer who had stopped in front of her and studied her with so much care mi	83.77254716135407
he was of pale complexion with clear blue eyes rather deeply set his mouth fine 	765.0303194495879
when they entered the port it was already night	83.10318645564013
the fog increased the darkness and formed round the sternlights and lanterns of 	270.4033006881491
the air they breathed was heavy damp and cold	1553.6391445899303
milady that woman so courageous and firm shivered in spite of herself	452.11514867443987
the officer desired to have miladys packages pointed out to him and ordered them	156.78469057205078
when this operation was complete he invited her to descend by offering her his h	214.71484722890986
milady looked at this man and hesitated	41.86038659776483
who are you sir asked she who has the kindness to trouble yourself so particular	115.58781193344441
you may perceive madame by my uniform that i am an officer in the english navy r	106.36061068897925
but is it the custom for the officers in the english navy to place themselves at	219.76495188358538
yes madame it is the custom not from gallantry but prudence that in time of war 	393.0264660046223
these words were pronounced with the most exact politeness and the most perfect 	75.87188918952972
nevertheless they had not the power of convincing milady	106.69072971544456
but i am not a foreigner sir said she with an accent as pure as ever was heard b	52.80579413456767
this measure is general madame and you will seek in vain to evade it	268.923798478296
i will follow you then sir	47.97643227633115
accepting the hand of the officer she began the descent of the ladder at the foo	40.03884436166425
the officer followed her	171.04256785141828
a large cloak was spread at the stern the officer requested her to sit down upon	134.02373747876806
row said he to the sailors	31.440526255929342
the eight oars fell at once into the sea making but a single sound giving but a 	437.471383851317
in five minutes they gained the land	143.35327010309092
the officer leaped to the pier and offered his hand to milady	56.73425873001376
a carriage was in waiting	99.8075971988393
is this carriage for us asked milady	55.06135582610435
yes madame replied the officer	24.366794654261508
the htel then is far away	252.56488504710626
at the other end of the town	10.532841607096346
very well said milady and she resolutely entered the carriage	89.38397178166178
the officer saw that the baggage was fastened carefully behind the carriage and 	201.9615505269814
immediately without any order being given or his place of destination indicated 	1293.108719811783
so strange a reception naturally gave milady ample matter for reflection so seei	1564.6407588146765
at the end of a quarter of an hour however surprised at the length of the journe	18.351203321755353
houses were no longer to be seen trees appeared in the darkness like great black	130.84088317259514
milady shuddered	349.62998851815416
but we are no longer in the city sir said she	31.18773325969937
the young officer preserved silence	1275.9385220880524
i beg you to understand sir i will go no farther unless you tell me whither you 	62.544068880950604
this threat brought no reply	1079.0179599418507
oh this is too much cried milady	28.869166824036633
help help	92.91909992937003
no voice replied to hers the carriage continued to roll on with rapidity the off	792.675999295739
milady looked at the officer with one of those terrible expressions peculiar to 	85.11900294837007
the young man remained immovable	29.193781568832016
milady tried to open the door in order to throw herself out	47.18094379782406
take care madame said the young man coolly you will kill yourself in jumping	117.97024978702302
milady reseated herself foaming	22907.33002762905
the officer leaned forward looked at her in his turn and appeared surprised to s	98.71924488217445
the artful creature at once comprehended that she was injuring herself by allowi	331.0157591958914
no violence will be offered to you madame and what happens to you is the result 	148.7775702551924
then you do nt know me sir	16.030229601381073
it is the first time i have had the honor of seeing you	14.427715838901317
and on your honor you have no cause of hatred against me	53.36961177561964
none i swear to you	24.18771016647057
there was so much serenity coolness mildness even in the voice of the young man 	291.3233178161124
at length after a journey of nearly an hour the carriage stopped before an iron 	104.07418180157228
then as the wheels rolled over a fine gravel milady could hear a vast roaring wh	410.8430897126757
the carriage passed under two arched gateways and at length stopped in a court l	234.47440606773876
almost immediately the door of the carriage was opened the young man sprang ligh	26.448543277939976
still then i am a prisoner said milady looking around her and bringing back her 	65.93592979337575
my own conscience and your politeness sir are the guarantees of that	243.18038696312826
however flattering this compliment the officer made no reply but drawing from hi	328.98162928383977
immediately several men appeared who unharnessed the smoking horses and put the 	999.7369164275359
then the officer with the same calm politeness invited his prisoner to enter the	141.87988937823678
she with a stillsmiling countenance took his arm and passed with him under a low	82.59617053340054
they then came to a massive door which after the introduction into the lock of a	98.10427661671253
with a single glance the prisoner took in the apartment in its minutest details	299.01773094953927
it was a chamber whose furniture was at once appropriate for a prisoner or a fre	192.22489958071338
in an instant all the strength of mind of this creature though drawn from the mo	77.43210392560168
but no one entered except two or three marines who brought her trunks and packag	253.58338194374346
the officer superintended all these details with the same calmness milady had co	75.82624561187247
it might have been said that between this man and his inferiors spoken language 	449.1656875490763
at length milady could hold out no longer she broke the silence	211.4017269391545
in the name of heaven sir cried she what means all that is passing put an end to	102.16915575269209
where am i and why am i here if i am free why these bars and these doors if i am	186.42904459780036
you are here in the apartment destined for you madame	108.3794426677316
i received orders to go and take charge of you on the sea and to conduct you to 	78.67878974798835
this order i believe i have accomplished with all the exactness of a soldier but	67.35169272071992
there terminates at least to the present moment the duty i had to fulfill toward	281.2191917413565
and who is that other person asked milady warmly	133.46844842079312
can you not tell me his name	17.15335604005133
at the moment a great jingling of spurs was heard on the stairs	123.25721581697078
some voices passed and faded away and the sound of a single footstep approached 	167.04253200862493
that person is here madame said the officer leaving the entrance open and drawin	83.46684138422619
at the same time the door opened a man appeared on the threshold	11.768715750805287
he was without a hat carried a sword and flourished a handkerchief in his hand	119.0643991963192
milady thought she recognized this shadow in the gloom she supported herself wit	327.5737556339741
the stranger advanced slowly and as he advanced after entering into the circle o	184.36025768792746
then when she had no longer any doubt she cried in a state of stupor what my bro	71.10599138959226
yes fair lady replied lord de winter making a bow half courteous half ironical i	671.4845226631213
but this castle then	1100.1485894762666
is mine	10333.505917593564
this chamber	3890.494768409975
is yours	12138.45506574421
i am then your prisoner	115.76525798408365
nearly so	335.7129646977658
but this is a frightful abuse of power	204.45877841035536
no highsounding words let us sit down and chat quietly as brother and sister oug	576.7530847853882
then turning toward the door and seeing that the young officer was waiting for h	25.78543356477864
all is well i thank you now leave us alone mr	115.51590719222224
chapter l	2.395954335557408
chat between brother and sister	4802.246294992256
during the time which lord de winter took to shut the door close a shutter and d	140.38804299287904
she knew her brotherinlaw to be a worthy gentleman a bold hunter an intrepid pla	322.48766025922606
how had he discovered her arrival and caused her to be seized why did he detain 	275.1718682315208
athos had dropped some words which proved that the conversation she had with the	151.6547332489948
she rather feared that her preceding operations in england might have been disco	442.4618728292271
buckingham might have guessed that it was she who had cut off the two studs and 	137.39895246777968
this supposition appeared to her most reasonable	947.7811227067965
it seemed to her that they wanted to revenge the past and not to anticipate the 	90.60823172681746
at all events she congratulated herself upon having fallen into the hands of her	120.07642031027727
yes let us chat brother said she with a kind of cheerfulness decided as she was 	385.9070151266111
you have then decided to come to england again said lord de winter in spite of t	28.774976278203628
milady replied to this question by another question	196.4144925715918
to begin with tell me said she how have you watched me so closely as to be aware	127.22270830633553
lord de winter adopted the same tactics as milady thinking that as his sisterinl	90.48125378492162
but tell me my dear sister replied he what makes you come to england	39.48904315148647
i come to see you replied milady without knowing how much she aggravated by this	169.04978096815879
ah to see me said de winter cunningly	77.82562365315259
to be sure to see you	15.297909843102808
what is there astonishing in that	60.498363199653255
and you had no other object in coming to england but to see me	72.92034461860416
so it was for me alone you have taken the trouble to cross the channel	110.94075232017994
for you alone	96.12445781406348
the deuce what tenderness my sister	2022.4353557026157
but am i not your nearest relative demanded milady with a tone of the most touch	163.05391695683724
and my only heir are you not said lord de winter in his turn fixing his eyes on 	71.19084082711397
whatever command she had over herself milady could not help starting and as in p	220.55860978756982
in fact the blow was direct and severe	193.61746826508053
the first idea that occurred to miladys mind was that she had been betrayed by k	51.7482507071982
she also recollected the furious and imprudent attack she had made upon dartagna	475.98425189965275
i do not understand my lord said she in order to gain time and make her adversar	52.34982972540198
what do you mean to say is there any secret meaning concealed beneath your words	141.3638213863901
oh my god no said lord de winter with apparent good nature	105.95251763407077
you wish to see me and you come to england	28.981729138583617
i learn this desire or rather i suspect that you feel it and in order to spare y	114.52741297687463
what is there more astonishing in all that i have said to you than in what you h	63.77517681848512
no what i think astonishing is that you should expect my coming	207.38799041662807
and yet that is the most simple thing in the world my dear sister	25.13228514218923
have you not observed that the captain of your little vessel on entering the roa	52.92621496937136
they brought me that book	946.0161454000256
i recognized your name in it	111.1346968133227
my heart told me what your mouth has just confirmedthat is to say with what view	187.9509044754514
you know the rest	58.09986573735567
milady knew that lord de winter lied and she was the more alarmed	247.3470114680487
my brother continued she was not that my lord buckingham whom i saw on the jetty	87.52519450765554
ah i can understand how the sight of him struck you replied lord de winter	120.04693662759678
you came from a country where he must be very much talked of and i know that his	111.91328420859999
my friend the cardinal cried milady seeing that on this point as on the other lo	48.945211132078995
is he not your friend replied the baron negligently	70.24823202485685
ah pardon i thought so but we will return to my lord duke presently	159.64022771440528
let us not depart from the sentimental turn our conversation had taken	154.58311407826002
you came you say to see me	119.86292758060935
well i reply that you shall be served to the height of your wishes and that we s	51.476770009049005
am i then to remain here eternally demanded milady with a certain terror	183.854767198591
do you find yourself badly lodged sister demand anything you want and i will has	870.3514160439536
but i have neither my women nor my servants	147.60816002693142
you shall have all madame	80.00397039883038
tell me on what footing your household was established by your first husband and	359.12270658662607
my first husband cried milady looking at lord de winter with eyes almost startin	93.91981328940838
yes your french husband	592.4414629268391
i do nt speak of my brother	32.63778066235284
if you have forgotten as he is still living i can write to him and he will send 	75.88527642877922
a cold sweat burst from the brow of milady	53.05869907517446
you jest said she in a hollow voice	79.53588515062147
do i look so asked the baron rising and going a step backward	237.6290286300083
or rather you insult me continued she pressing with her stiffened hands the two 	264.4865132287421
i insult you said lord de winter with contempt	195.23766388378894
in truth madame do you think that can be possible	44.280737146631374
indeed sir said milady you must be either drunk or mad	81.39011637768219
leave the room and send me a woman	59.431453617327726
women are very indiscreet my sister	261.3835888550738
can not i serve you as a waiting maid by that means all our secrets will remain 	298.1274887800065
insolent cried milady and as if acted upon by a spring she bounded toward the ba	146.07718565899933

i know you are accustomed to assassinate people but i warn you i shall defend my	68.6625344926532
you are right said milady	5.263527401672348
you have all the appearance of being cowardly enough to lift your hand against a	131.2464201200537
perhaps so and i have an excuse for mine would not be the first hand of a man th	55.13944189616908
and the baron pointed with a slow and accusing gesture to the left shoulder of m	251.73682804962326
milady uttered a deep inward shriek and retreated to a corner of the room like a	156.21247178032309
oh growl as much as you please cried lord de winter but do nt try to bite for i 	59.19303430231507
there are here no procurators who regulate successions beforehand	549.86239945552

the eyes of milady darted such flashes that although he was a man and armed befo	119.57823374134203
however he continued all the same but with increasing warmth yes i can very well	369.94043235932327
not a penny of what i possess will pass into your hands	163.74837889342194

and be assured that you shall be accompanied by one who will blow your brains ou	134.45260242211617
milady listened with an attention that dilated her inflamed eyes	378.25346679302845
yes at present continued lord de winter you will remain in this castle	155.34709349556408
the walls are thick the doors strong and the bars solid besides your window open	1295.5830426351195
the men of my crew who are devoted to me for life and death mount guard around t	235.11032555405254

before fifteen days are gone by i shall be away from here	162.07287405226455
ah try it	816.8903654636881
milady finding her thoughts betrayed dug her nails into her flesh to subdue ever	1079.5681176001722
lord de winter continued the officer who commands here in my absence you have al	57.40600783298132
he knows how as you must have observed to obey an orderfor you did not i am sure	96.58713338424029

pardieu if you succeed with him i pronounce you the demon himself	207.3823537461302
he went toward the door and opened it hastily	32.37518378159826
call mr	8.08081937096048
felton said he	17.778985804969302
wait a minute longer and i will introduce him to you	59.190437618952345
there followed between these two personages a strange silence during which the s	222.4594026796113
shortly a human form appeared in the shade of the corridor and the young lieuten	58.883844649519816
come in my dear john said lord de winter come in and shut the door	66.34665600178815
the young officer entered	170.24563691786543
now said the baron look at this woman	74.58712086399264
she is young she is beautiful she possesses all earthly seductions	398.5884154168084
well she is a monster who at twentyfive years of age has been guilty of as many 	149.38344499274743

feltons orders were for the rest executed with a silent rapidity that gave a goo	233.6405887222643
at length felton who had not yet looked at milady turned toward her	42.876050962676246
ah ah said he she is asleep that s well	55.92935275727473
when she wakes she can sup	807.4229691055873
and he made some steps toward the door	53.143079547545284
but my lieutenant said a soldier less stoical than his chief and who had approac	149.40502971995855
what not asleep said felton what is she doing then	157.40966196803234
she has fainted	130.9887056481363
her face is very pale and i have listened in vain i do not hear her breathe	93.28664490450375
you are right said felton after having looked at milady from the spot on which h	28.35627637029781
go and tell lord de winter that his prisoner has faintedfor this event not havin	102.36953445895884
the soldier went out to obey the orders of his officer	67.46879222117009
felton sat down upon an armchair which happened to be near the door and waited w	77.01901310065875
milady possessed that great art so much studied by women of looking through her 	618.2967835866647
she perceived felton who sat with his back toward her	97.4644137071843
she continued to look at him for nearly ten minutes and in these ten minutes the	59.624159690343426
she then thought that lord de winter would come and by his presence give fresh s	143.26744046324822
her first trial was lost she acted like a woman who reckons up her resources	339.9831459631135
as a result she raised her head opened her eyes and sighed deeply	77.52716383206673
at this sigh felton turned round	105.2586556043929
ah you are awake madame he said then i have nothing more to do here	52.18079611415658
if you want anything you can ring	170.39677891765123
oh my god my god how i have suffered said milady in that harmonious voice which 	65.02338602599639
and she assumed upon sitting up in the armchair a still more graceful and abando	243.23558897126853
felton arose	489.86364791765385
you will be served thus madame three times a day said he	253.60200399626984
in the morning at nine oclock in the day at one oclock and in the evening at eig	25.697725911698534
if that does not suit you you can point out what other hours you prefer and in t	217.33318257605492
but am i to remain always alone in this vast and dismal chamber asked milady	275.19784946798427
a woman of the neighbourhood has been sent for who will be tomorrow at the castl	43.68670486998527
i thank you sir replied the prisoner humbly	51.2405426276069
felton made a slight bow and directed his steps toward the door	54.102621168686376
at the moment he was about to go out lord de winter appeared in the corridor fol	39.55384267532354
he held a vial of salts in his hand	257.7314186702054
well what is itwhat is going on here said he in a jeering voice on seeing the pr	88.16914807754391
is this corpse come to life already felton my lad did you not perceive that you 	183.92693276770274
i thought so my lord said felton but as the prisoner is a woman after all i wish	38.66256969314737
milady shuddered through her whole system	693.8953836607903
these words of feltons passed like ice through her veins	210.0965278321482
so replied de winter laughing that beautiful hair so skillfully disheveled that 	272.6464100888109
no my lord replied the impassive young man your lordship may be assured that it 	98.55091427755583
in that case my brave lieutenant let us leave milady to find out something else 	130.79254001466893
and at these words lord de winter passed his arm through that of felton and led 	74.78427385074549
oh i will be a match for you murmured milady between her teeth be assured of tha	79.19200019677538
by the way resumed de winter stopping at the threshold of the door you must not 	70.960108192801
taste that fowl and those fish	872.2010293703881
on my honor they are not poisoned	44.16270519791738
i have a very good cook and he is not to be my heir i have full and perfect conf	79.32351996348203
do as i do	30.170133670847047
adieu dear sister till your next swoon	1913.0227784487952
this was all that milady could endure	99.01983907566724
her hands clutched her armchair she ground her teeth inwardly her eyes followed 	749.8170008239981
she cast her eyes upon the table saw the glittering of a knife rushed toward it 	109.20879751419602
the blade was round and of flexible silver	411.75996834232535
a burst of laughter resounded from the other side of the illclosed door and the 	22.810867828236795
ha ha cried lord de winter ha ha do nt you see my brave felton do nt you see wha	54.28356164105516
observe this is one of her peculiarities to get rid thus after one fashion or an	356.4969225075877
if i had listened to you the knife would have been pointed and of steel	129.67573191098253
then no more of felton she would have cut your throat and after that everybody e	184.9289425182726
see john see how well she knows how to handle a knife	394.6714196730022
in fact milady still held the harmless weapon in her clenched hand but these las	351.0104523832316
the knife fell to the ground	97.72627774036631
you were right my lord said felton with a tone of profound disgust which sounded	44.83625786495072
and both again left the room	126.51303959915481
but this time milady lent a more attentive ear than the first and she heard thei	145.83749060611063
i am lost murmured she i am lost i am in the power of men upon whom i can have n	56.389626454217904
it is however impossible that this should end as they have decreed	226.62408620368396
in fact as this last reflection indicatedthis instinctive return to hopesentimen	202.75239240547475
milady sat down to table ate from several dishes drank a little spanish wine and	245.88319017046774
before she went to bed she had pondered analyzed turned on all sides examined on	626.9512927008597
one expression above all recurred to the mind of the prisoner if i had listened 	266.0804975436811
felton then had spoken in her favor since lord de winter had not been willing to	80.28945056158634
weak or strong repeated milady that man has then a spark of pity in his soul of 	351.1182583234166
as to the other he knows me he fears me and knows what he has to expect of me if	81.32079274806108
it is useless then to attempt anything with him	86.24502912863964
but feltonthats another thing	751.9126089870751
he is a young ingenuous pure man who seems virtuous him there are means of destr	286.01970173947313
and milady went to bed and fell asleep with a smile upon her lips	46.19747215139814
anyone who had seen her sleeping might have said she was a young girl dreaming o	160.17069057979637
chapter liii	2.548346031995398
captivity the second day	29.201418060324766
milady dreamed that she at length had dartagnan in her power that she was presen	102.21345005891645
she slept as a prisoner sleeps rocked by his first hope	971.934750800256
in the morning when they entered her chamber she was still in bed	49.1341531551455
felton remained in the corridor	83.53417048000985
he brought with him the woman of whom he had spoken the evening before and who h	64.6681678907014
milady was habitually pale her complexion might therefore deceive a person who s	1073.7135197260895
i am in a fever said she i have not slept a single instant during all this long 	109.66169131048586
i suffer horribly	37543.00014799057
are you likely to be more humane to me than others were yesterday all i ask is p	278.09932245195085
would you like to have a physician called said the woman	92.31578533425292
felton listened to this dialogue without speaking a word	260.3787044703879
milady reflected that the more people she had around her the more she would have	295.3221987217367
besides the physician might declare the ailment feigned and milady after having 	172.30928635517503
go and fetch a physician said she	121.22749857931225
what could be the good of that these gentlemen declared yesterday that my illnes	168.9344685248408
then said felton who became impatient say yourself madame what treatment you wis	297.9704452748406
eh how can i tell my god i know that i suffer that s all	49.35673920977961
give me anything you like it is of little consequence	100.54287556241398
go and fetch lord de winter said felton tired of these eternal complaints	196.81754011333615
oh no no cried milady no sir do not call him i conjure you	38.46597462480627
i am well i want nothing do not call him	68.87361110372814
she gave so much vehemence such magnetic eloquence to this exclamation that felt	1374.1455077490455
he has come thought milady	95.5895819746666
meanwhile madame if you really suffer said felton a physician shall be sent for 	114.59099773926356
but at least we shall not have to reproach ourselves with anything	49.01602584144837
milady made no reply but turning her beautiful head round upon her pillow she bu	144.49296753287706
felton surveyed her for an instant with his usual impassiveness then seeing that	116.53877036411525
the woman followed him and lord de winter did not appear	54.35757678278456
i fancy i begin to see my way murmured milady with a savage joy burying herself 	298.6931037533288
two hours passed away	23.27440745471782
now it is time that the malady should be over said she let me rise and obtain so	128.99659822051606
i have but ten days and this evening two of them will be gone	70.91782527492379
in the morning when they entered miladys chamber they had brought her breakfast	86.16425667585135
now she thought they could not long delay coming to clear the table and that fel	201.44064763321967
milady was not deceived	30.398417889971476
felton reappeared and without observing whether milady had or had not touched he	274.245890891326
felton remained behind he held a book in his hand	89.41223436913533
milady reclining in an armchair near the chimney beautiful pale and resigned loo	227.46637606744886
felton approached her and said lord de winter who is a catholic like yourself ma	110.84509626491716
at the manner in which felton laid the book upon the little table near which mil	336.9232680448786
by that plain arrangement of the hair by that costume of extreme simplicity by t	280.62202777483725
bartholomew they sometimes came to seek refuge	751.5290691767186
she then had one of those sudden inspirations which only people of genius receiv	352.8183888745442
those two words your mass and a simple glance cast upon felton revealed to her a	395.7038827034698
i said she with an accent of disdain in unison with that which she had remarked 	108.60789910465272
and of what religion are you then madame asked felton with an astonishment which	63.37613867742795
i will tell it cried milady with a feigned exultation on the day when i shall ha	59.76030042435081
the look of felton revealed to milady the full extent of the space she had opene	71.68353922028236
the young officer however remained mute and motionless his look alone had spoken	301.6467555094331
i am in the hands of my enemies continued she with that tone of enthusiasm which	88.64018279251452
well let my god save me or let me perish for my god that is the reply i beg you 	90.12630902565633
and as to this book added she pointing to the manual with her finger but without	205.99438503066415
felton made no reply took the book with the same appearance of repugnance which 	103.31903976070662
lord de winter came toward five oclock in the evening	37.381930595058265
milady had had time during the whole day to trace her plan of conduct	293.8268214197555
she received him like a woman who had already recovered all her advantages	127.09034657273872
it appears said the baron seating himself in the armchair opposite that occupied	144.80935595603222
what do you mean sir	7.928530507717677
i mean to say that since we last met you have changed your religion	196.4896204342337
you have not by chance married a protestant for a third husband have you	207.21589384922362
explain yourself my lord replied the prisoner with majesty for though i hear you	71.24755395680585
then you have no religion at all i like that best replied lord de winter laughin	122.48927225957563
certainly that is most in accord with your own principles replied milady frigidl	123.80443389476044
oh i confess it is all the same to me	30.01622078550173
oh you need not avow this religious indifference my lord your debaucheries and c	313.97334987081337
what you talk of debaucheries madame messalina lady macbeth either i misundersta	98.67604132090638
you only speak thus because you are overheard coolly replied milady and you wish	248.25969253608164

as to the rest in eight days you will be where you ought to be and my task will 	102.68942058416545
infamous task impious task cried milady with the exultation of a victim who prov	324.9253819539644
my word said de winter rising i think the hussy is going mad come come calm your	181.6997976338623
its my spanish wine that has got into your head is it not but never mind that so	132.6217064323501
and lord de winter retired swearing which at that period was a very knightly hab	384.97555404052565
felton was indeed behind the door and had not lost one word of this scene	77.79549604494484
milady had guessed aright	553.3717541496502
yes go go said she to her brother the effects are drawing near on the contrary b	157.24334458842193
silence was reestablished	254314.56114214723
two hours passed away	23.05439637729965
miladys supper was brought in and she was found deeply engaged in saying her pra	347.2237507742537
she appeared to be in ecstasy and did not pay the least attention to what was go	130.59872319080782
felton made a sign that she should not be disturbed and when all was arranged he	32.878237494993186
milady knew she might be watched so she continued her prayers to the end and it 	189.94890655688266
for the moment she wished nothing better	116.8457537580247
she arose came to the table ate but little and drank only water	441.93262413328426
an hour after her table was cleared but milady remarked that this time felton di	102.09371935629376
he feared then to see her too often	348.907186771123
she turned toward the wall to smilefor there was in this smile such an expressio	96.35046397722147
she allowed therefore half an hour to pass away and as at that moment all was si	160.59536482012922

these verses were not excellentvery far from it but as it is well known the puri	88.3719830023195
while singing milady listened	888.5715330571678
the soldier on guard at her door stopped as if he had been changed into stone	129.22697550277869
milady was then able to judge of the effect she had produced	142.58686611482105
then she continued her singing with inexpressible fervor and feeling	705.5550206876444
it appeared to her that the sounds spread to a distance beneath the vaulted roof	512.512472109213
it however likewise appeared that the soldier on dutya zealous catholic no doubt	582.1342702957384
silence then exclaimed another stern voice which milady recognized as that of fe	158.8853614888483
what are you meddling with stupid did anybody order you to prevent that woman fr	299.245950421414
you were told to guard herto fire at her if she attempted to fly	180.80949480565138
guard her if she flies kill her but do nt exceed your orders	1624.1513731912185
an expression of unspeakable joy lightened the countenance of milady but this ex	90.44057736187341
without appearing to have heard the dialogue of which she had not lost a word sh	97.47910080436876
for all my tears my cares my exile and my chains i have my youth my prayers and 	666.4159494755255
her voice of immense power and sublime expression gave to the rude unpolished po	648.8831331663847
felton believed he heard the singing of the angel who consoled the three hebrews	154.23816362061584
milady continued	180.5261503715339
one day our doors will ope with god come our desire and if betrays that hope to 	598.8650140505912
this verse into which the terrible enchantress threw her whole soul completed th	1343.43916726742
he opened the door quickly and milady saw him appear pale as usual but with his 	55.031826534191985
why do you sing thus and with such a voice said he	119.17089866649046
your pardon sir said milady with mildness	104.65224193726823
i forgot that my songs are out of place in this castle	311.1787209533512
i have perhaps offended you in your creed but it was without wishing to do so i 	134.13172072090262
pardon me then a fault which is perhaps great but which certainly was involuntar	152.8808399970431
milady was so beautiful at this moment the religious ecstasy in which she appear	184.74209327483624
yes yes said he you disturb you agitate the people who live in the castle	190.62634238595675
the poor senseless young man was not aware of the incoherence of his words while	78.16502881978121
i will be silent then said milady casting down her eyes with all the sweetness s	116.20599300825063
no no madame said felton only do not sing so loud particularly at night	145.83686474084237
and at these words felton feeling that he could not long maintain his severity t	159.15500128106095
you have done right lieutenant said the soldier	109.38740378955538
such songs disturb the mind and yet we become accustomed to them her voice is so	545.4189435009934

captivity the third day	32.85777680261272
felton had fallen but there was still another step to be taken	79.8996631575439
he must be retained or rather he must be left quite alone and milady but obscure	250.23867467638237
still more must be done	170.28103483569632
he must be made to speak in order that he might be spoken tofor milady very well	52.27318907947389
yet in spite of all this seduction milady might failfor felton was forewarned an	79.73041584134741
from that moment she watched all his actions all his words from the simplest gla	235.5140411779437
in short she studied everything as a skillful comedian does to whom a new part h	379.5648261222409
face to face with lord de winter her plan of conduct was more easy	370.4290336587105
she had laid that down the preceding evening	412.30183706040896
to remain silent and dignified in his presence from time to time to irritate him	330.0705411474208
felton would see all perhaps he would say nothing but he would see	94.56656787643861
in the morning felton came as usual but milady allowed him to preside over all t	119.1901639367347
at the moment when he was about to retire she was cheered with a ray of hope for	67.76755405292877
toward midday lord de winter entered	806.0369716345949
it was a tolerably fine winters day and a ray of that pale english sun which lig	141.5011972174206
milady was looking out at the window and pretended not to hear the door as it op	56.92476045727729
ah ah said lord de winter after having played comedy after having played tragedy	538.7896512265995
the prisoner made no reply	51.175590998225424

milady folded her hands and raising her fine eyes toward heaven lord lord said s	230.03379271806412

at the moment he went out a piercing glance darted through the opening of the ne	51.62319861798123

guilty i said milady with a smile which might have disarmed the angel of the las	34.76079069671664
guilty oh my god thou knowest whether i am guilty say i am condemned sir if you 	156.0067228100702
were you condemned were you innocent were you a martyr replied felton the greate	748.1548518378654
oh you are a just man cried milady throwing herself at his feet	38.02215629535059
i can hold out no longer for i fear i shall be wanting in strength at the moment	105.53874336463046
listen then to the supplication of a despairing woman	199.64974953938773
you are abused sir but that is not the question	130.3085984772195
i only ask you one favor and if you grant it me i will bless you in this world a	82.82073300434382
speak to the master madame said felton happily i am neither charged with the pow	66.5210122779283
it is upon one higher placed than i am that god has laid this responsibility	540.3748314127873

if you have merited this shame madame if you have incurred this ignominy you mus	698.1232294693125
what do you say oh you do not understand me when i speak of ignominy you think i	47.72858529696166
would to heaven of what consequence to me is imprisonment or death	453.9706078124301
it is i who no longer understand you madame said felton	33.90703492665304
or rather who pretend not to understand me sir replied the prisoner with a smile	44.183568488336846
no madame on the honor of a soldier on the faith of a christian	30.05970606507715
what you are ignorant of lord de winters designs upon me	185.85902580092912
i am	10.94031537391881
impossible you are his confidant	490.7923274720794
i never lie madame	3343.7688865679565
oh he conceals them too little for you not to divine them	324.83738994094386
i seek to divine nothing madame i wait till i am confided in and apart from that	626.1246333589492
why then cried milady with an incredible tone of truthfulness you are not his ac	48.15108316605897
you are deceived madame said felton blushing lord de winter is not capable of su	54.79558676839867
good said milady to herself without thinking what it is he calls it a crime then	114.35535410163345
whom do you call that wretch asked felton	39.902759209479335
are there then in england two men to whom such an epithet can be applied	257.91632042419326
you mean george villiers asked felton whose looks became excited	160.1612966888379
whom pagans and unbelieving gentiles call duke of buckingham replied milady	557.7246677672529
i could not have thought that there was an englishman in all england who would h	55.12585033108635
the hand of the lord is stretched over him said felton he will not escape the ch	68.26546014365019
felton only expressed with regard to the duke the feeling of execration which al	91.31565867936648
oh my god my god cried milady when i supplicate thee to pour upon this man the c	105.52903112621189
do you know him then asked felton	13.009393615864141
at length he interrogates me said milady to herself at the height of joy at havi	80.62737392302363
oh know him yes yes to my misfortune to my eternal misfortune and milady twisted	479.01524598816206
felton no doubt felt within himself that his strength was abandoning him and he 	231.312243505891
sir cried she be kind be clement listen to my prayer that knife which the fatal 	402.28274594766236
only one minute mr	76.58003995131943
felton and you will have saved my honor	41.14650563021149
to kill yourself cried felton with terror forgetting to withdraw his hands from 	159.6833188032324
i have told sir murmured milady lowering her voice and allowing herself to sink 	176.46152354252663
felton remained standing motionless and undecided	556.1270422036476
he still doubts thought milady i have not been earnest enough	286.0281577234181
someone was heard in the corridor milady recognized the step of lord de winter	64.18890813345567
felton recognized it also and made a step toward the door	101.21274557078053
milady sprang toward him	83.21084258303902
oh not a word said she in a concentrated voice not a word of all that i have sai	46.229634187401444
then as the steps drew near she became silent for fear of being heard applying w	339.9512104934567
felton gently repulsed milady and she sank into a chair	171.26496181406281
lord de winter passed before the door without stopping and they heard the noise 	78.8579117681784
felton as pale as death remained some instants with his ear bent and listening t	354.1018417767733
ah said milady listening in her turn to the noise of feltons steps which withdre	50.47358540207916
then her brow darkened	1986.8116398405414
if he tells the baron said she i am lostfor the baron who knows very well that i	74.58452459769491
she placed herself before the glass and regarded herself attentively never had s	365.0484688397923
oh yes said she smiling but we wo nt tell him	61.164145097447296
in the evening lord de winter accompanied the supper	102.36660568498161
sir said milady is your presence an indispensable accessory of my captivity coul	120.59594493470603
how dear sister said lord de winter	135.91986796979126
did not you sentimentally inform me with that pretty mouth of yours so cruel to 	221.98066307455318
besides this time my visit has a motive	158.2804919834026
milady trembled she thought felton had told all	177.97880441076367
perhaps never in her life had this woman who had experienced so many opposite an	239.40360334427208
she was seated	52.566074591878035
lord de winter took a chair drew it toward her and sat down close beside her	114.86841876886989
then taking a paper out of his pocket he unfolded it slowly	71.04986525129492
here said he i want to show you the kind of passport which i have drawn up and w	44.811731491750244
then turning his eyes from milady to the paper he read order to conduct the name	84.88173267417595
if you have any preference you can point it out to me and if it be not within a 	82.09624078572443
i will begin again then	151.6982728942957
order to conduct tothe person named charlotte backson branded by the justice of 	195.07685926451467
she is to dwell in this place without ever going more than three leagues from it	231.9495408523718
in case of any attempt to escape the penalty of death is to be applied	119.67623311169434
she will receive five shillings per day for lodging and food	458.59682352516563
that order does not concern me replied milady coldly since it bears another name	133.36303409137858
a name have you a name then	165.81239686295532
i bear that of your brother	241.08012723468872
ay but you are mistaken	58.25532755299728
my brother is only your second husband and your first is still living	143.7367817903507
tell me his name and i will put it in the place of the name of charlotte backson	17.891640821062353
no you will not you are silent well then you must be registered as charlotte bac	105.386469844485
milady remained silent only this time it was no longer from affectation but from	204.5293759208827
she believed the order ready for execution	897.3197374206017
she thought that lord de winter had hastened her departure she thought she was c	95.60717773049113
everything in her mind was lost for an instant when all at once she perceived th	87.7516085183216
the joy she felt at this discovery was so great she could not conceal it	204.10975728377548
yes yes said lord de winter who perceived what was passing in her mind yes you l	69.0924195798531
it is only shown to me to terrify me that s all	52.87698750881128
you are mistaken	19.216014657082667
tomorrow this order will be sent to the duke of buckingham	23.932495475899206
the day after tomorrow it will return signed by his hand and marked with his sea	186.4200662881232
adieu madame	42.82376438538848
that is all i had to say to you	17.047893855259108
and i reply to you sir that this abuse of power this exile under a fictitious na	261.9651698659579
would you like better to be hanged in your true name milady you know that the en	63.20435910420916
speak freely	19457.409705475675
although my name or rather that of my brother would be mixed up with the affair 	92.29333806946909
milady made no reply but became as pale as a corpse	51.012671873894114
oh i see you prefer peregrination	60.41683641173246
that s well madame and there is an old proverb that says traveling trains youth	330.9428448640168
my faith you are not wrong after all and life is sweet	247.69920760559268
that s the reason why i take such care you shall not deprive me of mine	100.57332370960647
there only remains then the question of the five shillings to be settled	173.1284251297175
you think me rather parsimonious do nt you that s because i do nt care to leave 	101.18909995428346
besides you will always have your charms left to seduce them with	190.7166251980123
employ them if your check with regard to felton has not disgusted you with attem	145.48742612017634
felton has not told him said milady to herself	48.63730509450898
nothing is lost then	198.114105460416
and now madame till i see you again tomorrow i will come and announce to you the	54.92497119741425
lord de winter rose saluted her ironically and went out	176.57641668603725
milady breathed again	867.1748850073452
she had still four days before her	127.11386209108937
four days would quite suffice to complete the seduction of felton	113.98559302630812
a terrible idea however rushed into her mind	254.5444408492386
she thought that lord de winter would perhaps send felton himself to get the ord	86.78102277651892
in that case felton would escape herfor in order to secure success the magic of 	108.97060707861304
nevertheless as we have said one circumstance reassured her	132.38868610864185
felton had not spoken	36.62118673607593
as she would not appear to be agitated by the threats of lord de winter she plac	49.55596496807257
then as she had done the evening before she fell on her knees and repeated her p	39.803039218028395
as on the evening before the soldier stopped his march to listen to her	105.00414288748507
soon after she heard lighter steps than those of the sentinel which came from th	362.4109806235316
it is he said she	21.63670904588466
and she began the same religious chant which had so strongly excited felton the 	548.8402664471475
but although her voicesweet full and sonorousvibrated as harmoniously and as aff	176.94086527766916
it appeared however to milady that in one of the furtive glances she darted from	217.09775342717387
but whether this was reality or vision he had this time sufficient selfcommand n	653.4898390304959
however a few instants after she had finished her religious song milady thought 	732.2683611693482
then the same steps she had heard approach slowly withdrew as if with regret	608.8871913535509
chapter lv	2.4838738171886594
captivity the fourth day	74.86965674551405
the next day when felton entered miladys apartment he found her standing mounted	102.81019306258352
at the noise felton made in entering milady leaped lightly to the ground and tri	107.75284020963647
the young man was more pale than usual and his eyes reddened by want of sleep de	150.44563353220585
nevertheless his brow was armed with a severity more austere than ever	651.3724710267563
he advanced slowly toward milady who had seated herself and taking an end of the	57.87942730210213
that nothing said milady smiling with that painful expression which she knew so 	81.19277515151171
ennui is the mortal enemy of prisoners i had ennui and i amused myself with twis	291.1318186772128
felton turned his eyes toward the part of the wall of the apartment before which	31.174552487516028
he started and the prisoner saw that startfor though her eyes were cast down not	146.49208186984148
what were you doing on that armchair asked he	95.70661354330329
of what consequence replied milady	75.76465949696664
but replied felton i wish to know	19.42639298455093
do not question me said the prisoner you know that we who are true christians ar	101.98307630613182
well then said felton i will tell you what you were doing or rather what you mea	38.50221714979251
remember madame if our god forbids falsehood he much more severely condemns suic	2006.0489441366583
when god sees one of his creatures persecuted unjustly placed between suicide an	4052.7843747868396
you say either too much or too little speak madame	808.5302443075026
in the name of heaven explain yourself	135.98813176700466
that i may relate my misfortunes for you to treat them as fables that i may tell	74.48497444473816
besides of what importance to you is the life or death of a condemned wretch you	164.5039919922895
i madame i cried felton	157.62718233759222
you suppose that i would ever accept the price of your life oh you can not belie	81.13781742011103
let me act as i please felton let me act as i please said milady elated	171.4610712018102
every soldier must be ambitious must he not you are a lieutenant well you will f	198.22352980590384
what have i then done to you said felton much agitated that you should load me w	67.56782475656942
so cried milady as if she could not resist giving utterance to a holy indignatio	118.48868452032539
it is my duty to watch over your life madame and i will watch	82.94526583841794
but do you understand the mission you are fulfilling cruel enough if i am guilty	166.53623565901913
i am a soldier madame and fulfill the orders i have received	128.72691150459917
do you believe then that at the day of the last judgment god will separate blind	263.9708197603288
but i repeat it again to you replied felton in great emotion no danger threatens	159.652255505506
dunce cried milady dunce who dares to answer for another man when the wisest whe	255.06579952484645
impossible madame impossible murmured felton who felt to the bottom of his heart	112.67701499444419
a prisoner you will not recover your liberty through me living you will not lose	132.24224743036527
yes cried milady but i shall lose that which is much dearer to me than life i sh	54.86372015049442
this time felton immovable as he was or appeared to be could not resist the secr	118.44744683842502
to see this woman so beautiful fair as the brightest vision to see her by turns 	444.47922863283964
milady saw the trouble	224.48680465523697
she felt by intuition the flame of the opposing passions which burned with the b	288.1876668371448
as a skillful general seeing the enemy ready to surrender marches toward him wit	612.7124833892071
let this victim to baal be sent to the lions the martyr be thrown thy god shall 	1108.2316712851655
felton stood before this strange apparition like one petrified	989.9326301022923
who art thou who art thou cried he clasping his hands	131.77122512986688
art thou a messenger from god art thou a minister from hell art thou an angel or	593.4969674853503
do you not know me felton i am neither an angel nor a demon i am a daughter of e	59.900265116184
yes yes said felton i doubted but now i believe	54.65397032503404
you believe and still you are an accomplice of that child of belial who is calle	80.2140262886711
i deliver you up to buckingham i what mean you by that	159.26751151978766
they have eyes cried milady but they see not ears have they but they hear not	266.68613562158686
yes yes said felton passing his hands over his brow covered with sweat as if to 	40.18127528781579
yes i recognize the voice which speaks to me in my dreams yes i recognize the fe	87.50967036597143
a flash of terrible joy but rapid as thought gleamed from the eyes of milady	238.19898225840774
however fugitive this homicide flash felton saw it and started as if its light h	613.7982495047829
he recalled all at once the warnings of lord de winter the seductions of milady 	45.20239508339954
he drew back a step and hung down his head without however ceasing to look at he	146.33471808706247
milady was not a woman to misunderstand the meaning of this hesitation	129.16210569439468
under her apparent emotions her icy coolness never abandoned her	2769.861983591907
before felton replied and before she should be forced to resume this conversatio	91.71253950952733
the sword of the eternal is too heavy for my arm	221.2097332920441
allow me then to avoid dishonor by death let me take refuge in martyrdom	565.5367218507968
i do not ask you for liberty as a guilty one would nor for vengeance as would a 	153.79436191625012
let me die that is all	32.95356028028984
i supplicate you i implore you on my kneeslet me die and my last sigh shall be a	173.72251050954273
hearing that voice so sweet and suppliant seeing that look so timid and downcast	592.8614038720751
by degrees the enchantress had clothed herself with that magic adornment which s	199.468475085836
alas said felton i can do but one thing which is to pity you if you prove to me 	48.98772971778057
you are a christian you are my sister in religion	98.98419715611627
i feel myself drawn toward youi who have never loved anyone but my benefactori w	109.12748694143986

they have eyes repeated milady with an accent of indescribable grief but they se	74.40865158689815
but cried the young officer speak then speak	278.8026353501538
confide my shame to you cried milady with the blush of modesty upon her countena	184.0644150329784
to me to a brother said felton	44.330606458559394
milady looked at him for some time with an expression which the young man took f	18.729377649256122
felton in his turn a suppliant clasped his hands	179.56854530347437
well then said milady i confide in my brother i will dare to	44.70153406371449
at this moment the steps of lord de winter were heard but this time the terrible	46.77610232529765
he paused exchanged two words with the sentinel then the door opened and he appe	71.23855155309123
during the exchange of these two words felton drew back quickly and when lord de	113.01725351285262
the baron entered slowly sending a scrutinizing glance from milady to the young 	237.75018827219563
you have been here a very long time john said he	39.17108894113121
has this woman been relating her crimes to you in that case i can comprehend the	168.34776601087273
felton started and milady felt she was lost if she did not come to the assistanc	50.908109836941556
ah you fear your prisoner should escape said she	286.7887166382538
well ask your worthy jailer what favor i this instant solicited of him	1915.8353332183715
you demanded a favor said the baron suspiciously	795.079034760122
yes my lord replied the young man confused	17.460180458471314
and what favor pray asked lord de winter	325.0316857756442
a knife which she would return to me through the grating of the door a minute af	76.43221912552887
there is someone then concealed here whose throat this amiable lady is desirous 	1148.732973896389
there is myself replied milady	62.99872995872288
i have given you the choice between america and tyburn replied lord de winter	69.94613786241317
choose tyburn madame	183.83460448377534
believe me the cord is more certain than the knife	160.52898555724988
felton grew pale and made a step forward remembering that at the moment he enter	128.9322744149017
you are right said she i have often thought of it	20.706402523703538
then she added in a low voice and i will think of it again	29.265561168928024
felton felt a shudder run to the marrow of his bones probably lord de winter per	440.63433145157904
mistrust yourself john said he	25.349046539540854
i have placed reliance upon you my friend	147.6910264890205

felton lowered his head and reflected	49.87899735439615

de winter has changed his usual stupidity into a strange prudence	481.5545882750333
it is the desire of vengeance and how desire molds a man as to felton he hesitat	71.7116760126136
ah he is not a man like that cursed dartagnan	30.38018128509821
a puritan only adores virgins and he adores them by clasping his hands	665.6705560319134
a musketeer loves women and he loves them by clasping his arms round them	1098.179462707401
milady waited then with much impatience for she feared the day would pass away w	158.4079434151758
at last in an hour after the scene we have just described she heard someone spea	58.406888349930604
presently the door opened and she perceived felton	43.20055770474438
the young man advanced rapidly into the chamber leaving the door open behind him	63.12345975235867
what do you want with me said she	12.342485998558097
listen replied felton in a low voice	7.2765696742975745
i have just sent away the sentinel that i might remain here without anybody know	165.4373395647574
the baron has just related a frightful story to me	134.67750285838213
milady assumed her smile of a resigned victim and shook her head	212.90824567505422
either you are a demon continued felton or the baronmy benefactor my fatheris a 	113.03379920745684
i have known you four days i have loved him four years	61.6222311832013
i therefore may hesitate between you	1105.4181030287423
be not alarmed at what i say i want to be convinced	56.399925754978185
tonight after twelve i will come and see you and you shall convince me	88.92670748656805

no i am lost do not be lost with me	85.55872774591232
my death will be much more eloquent than my life and the silence of the corpse w	70.22488851801587
be silent madame cried felton and do not speak to me thus i came to entreat you 	39.55503091991338
i will not promise said milady for no one has more respect for a promise or an o	61.56220001773442
well said felton only promise till you have seen me again	79.57055676374436
if when you have seen me again you still persistwell then you shall be free and 	59.546167608288634
well said milady for you i will wait	26.10734797751902
i swear it by our god	237.41813839246518
are you satisfied	5.328722657525071
well said felton till tonight	403.8558880813204
and he darted out of the room shut the door and waited in the corridor the soldi	32.10856723740875
the soldier returned and felton gave him back his weapon	128.13618249769925
then through the grating to which she had drawn near milady saw the young man ma	60.38181483108505
as for her she returned to her place with a smile of savage contempt upon her li	56.75798917491286

milady had however achieved a halftriumph and success doubled her forces	1218.2262379353735
it was not difficult to conquer as she had hitherto done men prompt to let thems	160.15022329730988
milady was handsome enough not to find much resistance on the part of the flesh 	95.12628695216311
but this time she had to contend with an unpolished nature concentrated and inse	316.1312255848193

in short she had taken the measure of motives hitherto unknown to herself throug	291.5435793870646
many a time nevertheless during the evening she despaired of fate and of herself	657.9111808211065
she did not invoke god we very well know but she had faith in the genius of evil	294.4696364358679
milady being well prepared for the reception of felton was able to erect her bat	99.14310316182227
she knew she had only two days left that when once the order was signed by bucki	107.62102700579781
to be a woman condemned to a painful and disgraceful punishment is no impediment	660.6713856186436
like all persons of real genius milady knew what suited her nature and her means	593.9544740071715
poverty was repugnant to her degradation took away twothirds of her greatness	1163.788977744264
milady was only a queen while among queens	324.94831336448385
the pleasure of satisfied pride was necessary to her domination	303.451960322483
to command inferior beings was rather a humiliation than a pleasure for her	2218.177231150081
she should certainly return from her exileshe did not doubt that a single instan	85.03060783715576

then milady collected all her energies murmuring in the depths of her soul the n	119.11613184621002
time however passed away the hours one after another seemed to awaken the clock 	170.29540719168267
at nine oclock lord de winter made his customary visit examined the window and t	105.40104398572832
doubtless both of them understood that the situation had become too serious to l	119.81972611399395
well said the baron on leaving her you will not escape tonight	118.10161644020347
at ten oclock felton came and placed the sentinel	33.08910780137621
milady recognized his step	298.1680066384957
she was as well acquainted with it now as a mistress is with that of the lover o	76.73564733138895
that was not the appointed hour	201.54412477515908
felton did not enter	56.17739126065758
two hours after as midnight sounded the sentinel was relieved	322.4253877621355
this time it was the hour and from this moment milady waited with impatience	98.3795868731996
the new sentinel commenced his walk in the corridor	508.1808281289979
at the expiration of ten minutes felton came	12.016700240564612
milady was all attention	330.1287805474246
listen said the young man to the sentinel	20.924744727864013
on no pretense leave the door for you know that last night my lord punished a so	602.3199509020274
yes i know it said the soldier	20.872128757388946
i recommend you therefore to keep the strictest watch	176.45033282366578
for my part i am going to pay a second visit to this woman who i fear entertains	85.33789035440923
good murmured milady the austere puritan lies	722.0897983574266
as to the soldier he only smiled	150.7296971706445
zounds lieutenant said he you are not unlucky in being charged with such commiss	133.59827902304815
felton blushed	576.7272337383674
under any other circumstances he would have reprimanded the soldier for indulgin	135.91960872346414
if i call come said he	67.27767441176405
if anyone comes call me	629.6380498006941
i will lieutenant said the soldier	241.48465140944631
felton entered miladys apartment	234.06186944227665
milady arose	685.0115055969319
you are here said she	31.181012079550243
i promised to come said felton and i have come	29.89380282468405
you promised me something else	241.967838169756
what my god said the young man who in spite of his selfcommand felt his knees tr	68.41992879154483
you promised to bring a knife and to leave it with me after our interview	160.97111168637613
say no more of that madame said felton	27.537551043313407
there is no situation however terrible it may be which can authorize a creature 	616.8688195332263
i have reflected and i can not must not be guilty of such a sin	126.4451306224028
ah you have reflected said the prisoner sitting down in her armchair with a smil	61.81169455777601
upon what	66.91342757986484
that i can have nothing to say to a man who does not keep his word	29.87247861061358
oh my god murmured felton	18.1677959550154
you may retire said milady	39.865759115715996
i will not talk	63.48447956642286
here is the knife said felton drawing from his pocket the weapon which he had br	23.968555699601417
let me see it said milady	9.706434357895327
for what purpose	24.211475280877607
upon my honor i will instantly return it to you	50.341602627055735
you shall place it on that table and you may remain between it and me	149.15212165580581
felton offered the weapon to milady who examined the temper of it attentively an	174.38439606538697
well said she returning the knife to the young officer this is fine and good ste	94.8592667024751
you are a faithful friend felton	22.18455813195619
felton took back the weapon and laid it upon the table as he had agreed with the	61.13492840992938
milady followed him with her eyes and made a gesture of satisfaction	27.527586472572146
now said she listen to me	45.14940288314134
the request was needless	723.6861026493524
the young officer stood upright before her awaiting her words as if to devour th	318.3590325420687
felton said milady with a solemnity full of melancholy imagine that your sister 	155.4507593671915
while yet young unfortunately handsome i was dragged into a snare	850.743301152407
i resisted	79841712.63886474
ambushes and violences multiplied around me but i resisted	532.7835651294807
the religion i serve the god i adore were blasphemed because i called upon that 	569.0120629790649
then outrages were heaped upon me and as my soul was not subdued they wished to 	308.15891750822834
milady stopped and a bitter smile passed over her lips	54.668957479778655
finally said felton finally what did they do	116.07679024244355
at length one evening my enemy resolved to paralyze the resistance he could not 	381.30359162153366
one evening he mixed a powerful narcotic with my water	685.1496878037636
scarcely had i finished my repast when i felt myself sink by degrees into a stra	200.92434571383936
although i was without mistrust a vague fear seized me and i tried to struggle a	315.5551586736049
i arose	44493.283703288274
i wished to run to the window and call for help but my legs refused their office	147.8784746968158
it appeared as if the ceiling sank upon my head and crushed me with its weight	204.66303184537063
i stretched out my arms	253.5702022265217
i tried to speak	114.04670168536583
i could only utter inarticulate sounds and irresistible faintness came over me	2003.5634326324155
i supported myself by a chair feeling that i was about to fall but this support 	194.61945939655772
i fell upon one knee then upon both	645.6732183713988
i tried to pray but my tongue was frozen	609.1032426634712

of all that passed in that sleep or the time which glided away while it lasted i	335.4649317244533
the only thing i recollect is that i awoke in bed in a round chamber the furnitu	117.51279286023414
no door gave entrance to the room	924.280183870791
it might be called a magnificent prison	132.9247770883341
it was a long time before i was able to make out what place i was in or to take 	62.492853370483424
my mind appeared to strive in vain to shake off the heavy darkness of the sleep 	413.4265488961796
i had vague perceptions of space traversed of the rolling of a carriage of a hor	391.8298069221912
at times the state into which i had fallen appeared so strange that i believed m	246.55075687704485
i arose trembling	132709.9668559867
my clothes were near me on a chair i neither remembered having undressed myself 	698.4645262425335
then by degrees the reality broke upon me full of chaste terrors	711.191843127645
i was no longer in the house where i had dwelt	57.71715193735519
as well as i could judge by the light of the sun the day was already twothirds g	64.29419290046616

certainly i was not the first captive that had been shut up in this splendid pri	98.27985766838212
yes it was a prison for i tried in vain to get out of it	48.956321707142564
i sounded all the walls in the hopes of discovering a door but everywhere the wa	286.6365525820333
i made the tour of the room at least twenty times in search of an outlet of some	145.02343243096973
i sank exhausted with fatigue and terror into an armchair	467.8044226383419
meantime night came on rapidly and with night my terrors increased	628.6411595090749
i did not know but i had better remain where i was seated	83.49908568488839
it appeared that i was surrounded with unknown dangers into which i was about to	99.34649996272779
although i had eaten nothing since the evening before my fears prevented my feel	191.35938399127568
no noise from without by which i could measure the time reached me i only suppos	280.26177235468674
all at once the noise of a door turning on its hinges made me start	111.84249203302913
a globe of fire appeared above the glazed opening of the ceiling casting a stron	350.18709853212573
a table with two covers bearing a supper ready prepared stood as if by magic in 	389.5389705102901
that man was he who had pursued me during a whole year who had vowed my dishonor	261.11799692731984
scoundrel murmured felton	16.219939082112553
oh yes scoundrel cried milady seeing the interest which the young officer whose 	102.9066188873864

take one step more said i and in addition to my dishonor you shall have my death	145.81697753219922
there was no doubt in my look my voice my whole person that sincerity of gesture	276.5792943228611

at these words he blew a whistle the globe of fire which lighted the room reasce	130.04640023341912
i found myself again in complete darkness	589.2243835346508
the same noise of a door opening and shutting was repeated the instant afterward	745.6269346914015
this moment was frightful if i had any doubts as to my misfortune these doubts h	182.2161317485428
i was in the power of a man whom i not only detested but despisedof a man capabl	52.558655739995444
but who then was this man asked felton	76.40598270960852
i passed the night on a chair starting at the least noise for toward midnight th	201.73690488906757
but the night passed away without any fresh attempt on the part of my persecutor	63.18504347844032
day came the table had disappeared only i had still the knife in my hand	123.64048551848036
this knife was my only hope	411.24391134695657
i was worn out with fatigue	145.74579521604798
sleeplessness inflamed my eyes i had not dared to sleep a single instant	208.66352736032297
the light of day reassured me i went and threw myself on the bed without parting	311.88180404249084
when i awoke a fresh meal was served	433.2871370951065
this time in spite of my terrors in spite of my agony i began to feel a devourin	42.15586317524474
it was fortyeight hours since i had taken any nourishment	313.91960708750594
i ate some bread and some fruit then remembering the narcotic mixed with the wat	638.4102087387648
and yet notwithstanding these precautions i remained for some time in a terrible	244.71281855437564
but my fears were this time illfounded i passed the day without experiencing any	368.4291223125018
i took the precaution to half empty the carafe in order that my suspicions might	294.23748313336677
the evening came on and with it darkness but however profound was this darkness 	317.83664374604615
i saw amid the shadows the table sink through the floor a quarter of an hour lat	161.89213416298313
in an instant thanks to the lamp my chamber was once more lighted	176.61692066346004
i was determined to eat only such things as could not possibly have anything sop	166.76350509652843
two eggs and some fruit composed my repast then i drew another glass of water fr	1008.7066800206482
at the first swallow it appeared to me not to have the same taste as in the morn	102.87502285232577
suspicion instantly seized me	677.5091650722911
i paused but i had already drunk half a glass	339.393877042719
i threw the rest away with horror and waited with the dew of fear upon my brow	221.11798383650085
no doubt some invisible witness had seen me draw the water from that fountain an	604.0911802663758
half an hour had not passed when the same symptoms began to appear but as i had 	80.97753048604623
i dragged myself toward the bed to seek the only defense i had leftmy saving kni	426.19330749816083
i sank on my knees my hands clasped round one of the bedposts then i felt that i	88.35656145750346
felton became frightfully pale and a convulsive tremor crept through his whole b	194.834321256117
and what was most frightful continued milady her voice altered as if she still e	317.71011940727095
it is true that all was like a dream but it was not the less frightful	51.19437210844699
i saw the lamp ascend and leave me in darkness then i heard the wellknown creaki	182.5936136215416
i felt instinctively that someone approached me it is said that the doomed wretc	218.7452874396325
i wished to make an effort i attempted to cry out	143.2026922520576
by an incredible effort of will i even raised myself up but only to sink down ag	241.3683790669182
tell me who this man was cried the young officer	70.37040108320858
milady saw at a single glance all the painful feelings she inspired in felton by	227.8034075319881
the more profoundly she wounded his heart the more certainly he would avenge her	700.1908759157776
she continued then as if she had not heard his exclamation or as if she thought 	74.74516514740861
only this time it was no longer an inert body without feeling that the villain h	256.8728263590327
i have told you that without being able to regain the complete exercise of my fa	78.38778486262561
i struggled then with all my strength and doubtless opposed weak as i was a long	245.56753158626748
alas this desperate resistance could not last long	1267.7222848383972
i felt my strength fail and this time it was not my sleep that enabled the cowar	146.5592957437812
felton listened without uttering any word or sound except an inward expression o	560.403283375591
the sweat streamed down his marble forehead and his hand under his coat tore his	332.2558624397341
my first impulse on coming to myself was to feel under my pillow for the knife i	319.438677559793
but on taking this knife felton a terrible idea occurred to me	183.17431702400498
i have sworn to tell you all and i will tell you all	24.073142313150942
i have promised you the truth i will tell it were it to destroy me	56.6415967898718
the idea came into your mind to avenge yourself on this man did it not cried fel	152.70787505886221
yes said milady	4.008699819607516
the idea was not that of a christian i knew but without doubt that eternal enemy	229.2213409889494
in short what shall i say to you felton continued milady in the tone of a woman 	24.529952088539773

continue continue said felton i am eager to see you attain your vengeance	115.81947823297591
oh i resolved that it should take place as soon as possible	69.31522832986785
i had no doubt he would return the following night	99.4385866106158
during the day i had nothing to fear	33.225577259974926
when the hour of breakfast came therefore i did not hesitate to eat and drink	101.08999328406047
i had determined to make believe sup but to eat nothing	423.7421758907471
i was forced then to combat the fast of the evening with the nourishment of the 	226.24132722666778

the day passed away without having any other influence on me than to strengthen 	155.82071050728553
several times even i felt a smile on my lips	87.1188047095317
felton i dare not tell you at what idea i smiled you would hold me in horror	130.66238306031283
go on go on said felton you see plainly that i listen and that i am anxious to k	27.88348006070505
evening came the ordinary events took place	646.3028338789411
during the darkness as before my supper was brought	256.3915383658868
then the lamp was lighted and i sat down to table	47.23691732386704
i only ate some fruit	3459.1624643667974
i pretended to pour out water from the jug but i only drank that which i had sav	158.90286357737506
the substitution was made so carefully that my spies if i had any could have no 	453.2743252191694

oh my god who could have said so the evening before i began to fear that he woul	56.139365931754455
at length i saw the lamp rise softly and disappear in the depths of the ceiling 	88.33427660336828
nearly ten minutes passed i heard no other noise but the beating of my own heart	83.52242080846747
i implored heaven that he might come	793.920142219059
at length i heard the wellknown noise of the door which opened and shut i heard 	75.59234738139055

i looked upon myself as another judith i gathered myself up my knife in my hand 	130.07616889888507
the miserable villain he had foreseen all	786.6127378859194
his breast was covered with a coatofmail the knife was bent against it	146.60067345522353

with my usual fatuity i doubted it now i am convinced	94.52405487446029
tomorrow you shall be free	33.404053142312826
i had but one wish that was that he should kill me	60.79492257327728

very well cried i then the place of my punishment will be that of my tomb	130.0071532217368
i will die here and you will see if a phantom that accuses is not more terrible 	80.2922071284333

at these words he retired	36.7755289291943
i heard the door open and shut and i remained overwhelmed less i confess it by m	246.17788919170476
he kept his word	93.52024781969834
all the day all the next night passed away without my seeing him again	272.8522903497059
but i also kept my word with him and i neither ate nor drank	194.6151905610376
i was as i told him resolved to die of hunger	75.9585500591494
i passed the day and the night in prayer for i hoped that god would pardon me my	107.17507892882674
the second night the door opened i was lying on the floor for my strength began 	84.86522057664847
at the noise i raised myself up on one hand	159.25839842040756

beware said the voice in a threatening accent that i had never yet heard	45.92195832360614
i have an extraordinary means which i will not employ but in the last extremity 	137.71234921509281
i mustered all my strength to reply to him with a burst of laughter	99.99328321674267
he saw that it was a merciless war between usa war to the death	114.60148933870133
listen said he	7.201582988415778
i give you the rest of tonight and all day tomorrow	116.17230779947666

you repeated i	683.3541878813197
oh i declare to you felton i thought him mad	67.20569223562917
yes yes i replied he	54.00365982731865

till tomorrow evening then	283.4573936142407
till tomorrow evening then replied i allowing myself to fall and biting the carp	454.6720792451625
felton leaned for support upon a piece of furniture and milady saw with the joy 	212.95820063554916
chapter lvii	2.840773017224516
means for classical tragedy	1640.0609889256846
after a moment of silence employed by milady in observing the young man who list	109.14955245323588
it was nearly three days since i had eaten or drunk anything	104.04431097394735
i suffered frightful torments	127169.58948781194
at times there passed before me clouds which pressed my brow which veiled my eye	946.4619329029774
when the evening came i was so weak that every time i fainted i thanked god for 	260.3763454744857
in the midst of one of these swoons i heard the door open	47.34429999411354
terror recalled me to myself	428.4630511307962
he entered the apartment followed by a man in a mask	38.78968067192605
he was masked likewise but i knew his step i knew his voice i knew him by that i	247.69968005478822
well said he to me have you made your mind up to take the oath i requested of yo	97.44796306812367
you have said puritans have but one word	59.70279482373713
mine you have heard and that is to pursue youon earth to the tribunal of men in 	111.63852848889174
you persist then	227.9843401873441
i swear it before the god who hears me	78.85245961119575
i will take the whole world as a witness of your crime and that until i have fou	74.30852121186533
you are a prostitute said he in a voice of thunder and you shall undergo the pun	53.980167195262524
then addressing the man who accompanied him executioner said he do your duty	175.1741363936545
oh his name his name cried felton	91.7151634638658
his name tell it me	417.2659678934087
then in spite of my cries in spite of my resistancefor i began to comprehend tha	68.96559582465463
a burning fire a redhot iron the iron of the executioner was imprinted on my sho	544.0168583846657
felton uttered a groan	68.51071955856077
here said milady rising with the majesty of a queen here felton behold the new m	179.71365257517272
learn to know the heart of men and henceforth make yourself less easily the inst	216.02998824462907
milady with a rapid gesture opened her robe tore the cambric that covered her bo	282.90686929062826
but cried felton that is a fleurdelis which i see there	146.83357083083266
and therein consisted the infamy replied milady	1624.142079749104
the brand of englandit would be necessary to prove what tribunal had imposed it 	473.28128909192833
this was too much for felton	49.58418737128789
pale motionless overwhelmed by this frightful revelation dazzled by the superhum	217.87128597145747
the brand disappeared the beauty alone remained	5462.763245300566
pardon pardon cried felton oh pardon	130.62052102312103
milady read in his eyes love love	298.6649043463435
pardon for what asked she	82.19828087960114
pardon me for having joined with your persecutors	525.8297310675805
milady held out her hand to him	39.74450186803095
so beautiful so young cried felton covering that hand with his kisses	623.4344370896971
milady let one of those looks fall upon him which make a slave of a king	210.42588303321008
felton was a puritan he abandoned the hand of this woman to kiss her feet	169.862981799278
he no longer loved her he adored her	494.20314774196544
when this crisis was past when milady appeared to have resumed her selfpossessio	95.22313392107453
for to me there is but one the other was an instrument that was all	185.1268382924543
what brother cried milady must i name him again have you not yet divined who he 	267.40648400768566
what cried felton heagain healways he whatthe truly guilty	198.67357869100752
the truly guilty said milady is the ravager of england the persecutor of true be	177.3856418317974
buckingham it is then buckingham cried felton in a high state of excitement	64.3642535977251
milady concealed her face in her hands as if she could not endure the shame whic	42.016869954967895
buckingham the executioner of this angelic creature cried felton	248.35678266223235
and thou hast not hurled thy thunder at him my god and thou hast left him noble 	974.7231783532688
god abandons him who abandons himself said milady	274.53491540863143
but he will draw upon his head the punishment reserved for the damned said felto	188.50306835772167
he wills that human vengeance should precede celestial justice	22589.983498129313
men fear him and spare him	668.9565998637295
i said felton i do not fear him nor will i spare him	61.19279216504095
the soul of milady was bathed in an infernal joy	566.4713567951356
but how can lord de winter my protector my father asked felton possibly be mixed	229.9736911851889
listen felton resumed milady for by the side of base and contemptible men there 	255.41290957074685
i had an affianced husband a man whom i loved and who loved mea heart like yours	775.8345177588266
i went to him and told him all he knew me that man did and did not doubt an inst	70.1972011909446
he was a nobleman a man equal to buckingham in every respect	97.50508751411242
he said nothing he only girded on his sword wrapped himself in his cloak and wen	75.60381063683356
yes yes said felton i understand how he would act	44.98936139063589
but with such men it is not the sword that should be employed it is the poniard	119.42927802547835
buckingham had left england the day before sent as ambassador to spain to demand	154.61090561294841
who was then only prince of wales	84.45748760185641
my affianced husband returned	54967.70941104184
hear me said he this man has gone and for the moment has consequently escaped my	82.36883909722275
lord de winter cried felton	12.339164162222048
yes said milady lord de winter and now you can understand it all can you not buc	40.95848467290358
a week before his return lord de winter died leaving me his sole heir	163.82358846311962
whence came the blow god who knows all knows without doubt but as for me i accus	189.7646764484349
oh what an abyss what an abyss cried felton	638.4567863473886
lord de winter died without revealing anything to his brother	160.40349888588227
the terrible secret was to be concealed till it burst like a clap of thunder ove	137.99408305159864
your protector had seen with pain this marriage of his elder brother with a port	456.1876785873349
i was sensible that i could look for no support from a man disappointed in his h	267.2205125672413
i went to france with a determination to remain there for the rest of my life	40.24805515854402
but all my fortune is in england	52.14296470440433
communication being closed by the war i was in want of everything	156.69836566074324
i was then obliged to come back again	62.08750788515107
six days ago i landed at portsmouth	44.79055022766687
well said felton	4.396309600873625
well buckingham heard by some means no doubt of my return	108.91813886716446
he spoke of me to lord de winter already prejudiced against me and told him that	155.15779846344932
the noble and pure voice of my husband was no longer here to defend me	149.7443119484649
lord de winter believed all that was told him with so much the more ease that it	102.73085428810899
he caused me to be arrested had me conducted hither and placed me under your gua	239.5112771620755
you know the rest	58.8688529035344
the day after tomorrow he banishes me he transports me the day after tomorrow he	233.82058277006112
oh the train is well laid the plot is clever	924.7267523574768
my honor will not survive it you see then felton i can do nothing but die	117.84577225170314
felton give me that knife	291.0611666147827
and at these words as if all her strength was exhausted milady sank weak and lan	116.82213239357644
no no said he	17.564888661152256
no you shall live honored and pure you shall live to triumph over your enemies	792.4409322323637
milady put him from her slowly with her hand while drawing him nearer with her l	100.2539580079578
oh death death said she lowering her voice and her eyelids oh death rather than 	331.51506958285285
no cried felton no you shall live and you shall be avenged	82.60578101374055
felton i bring misfortune to all who surround me felton abandon me felton let me	228.88592248930283
well then we will live and die together cried he pressing his lips to those of t	68.83493468383288
several strokes resounded on the door this time milady really pushed him away fr	207.81573591785664
hark said she we have been overheard someone is coming all is over we are lost	159.0160296443871
no said felton it is only the sentinel warning me that they are about to change 	72.48005112017567
then run to the door and open it yourself	86.82891312751545
felton obeyed this woman was now his whole thought his whole soul	325.04315502971224
he found himself face to face with a sergeant commanding a watchpatrol	265.8400473320631
well what is the matter asked the young lieutenant	14.871851744474835
you told me to open the door if i heard anyone cry out said the soldier but you 	66.35681211187968
i heard you cry out without understanding what you said	334.65777557171486
i tried to open the door but it was locked inside then i called the sergeant	138.13661513999534
and here i am said the sergeant	53.583604417209024
felton quite bewildered almost mad stood speechless	3915.94099542422
milady plainly perceived that it was now her turn to take part in the scene	224.92825798397786
she ran to the table and seizing the knife which felton had laid down exclaimed 	86.82104686594352
great god exclaimed felton on seeing the knife glitter in her hand	138.95342080815414
at that moment a burst of ironical laughter resounded through the corridor	161.25620911266114
the baron attracted by the noise in his chamber gown his sword under his arm sto	118.19226242877515
ah said he here we are at the last act of the tragedy	51.55371792303922
you see felton the drama has gone through all the phases i named but be easy no 	273.34101575700856
milady perceived that all was lost unless she gave felton an immediate and terri	216.323872681155
you are mistaken my lord blood will flow and may that blood fall back on those w	302.7889597408153
felton uttered a cry and rushed toward her	40.650305892964774
he was too late milady had stabbed herself	111.81204437365602
but the knife had fortunately we ought to say skillfully come in contact with th	249.3136062666944
it had glided down it tearing the robe and had penetrated slantingly between the	482.1984222779679
miladys robe was not the less stained with blood in a second	368.1053094928436
milady fell down and seemed to be in a swoon	59.992193138135846
felton snatched away the knife	608.6796336106174
see my lord said he in a deep gloomy tone here is a woman who was under my guard	48.88192199311801
be at ease felton said lord de winter	50.86681075481985
she is not dead demons do not die so easily	176.83593765917783
be tranquil and go wait for me in my chamber	237.14387639434284
but my lord	11.532836304721501
go sir i command you	70.35315581250758
at this injunction from his superior felton obeyed but in going out he put the k	190.96350717287842
as to lord de winter he contented himself with calling the woman who waited on m	124.40028209373226
meanwhile all things considered and notwithstanding his suspicions as the wound 	559.7887448017889
chapter lviii	2.2044422609746546
as lord de winter had thought miladys wound was not dangerous	217.55569182741868
so soon as she was left alone with the woman whom the baron had summoned to her 	93.61447763870154
it was however necessary to affect weakness and painnot a very difficult task fo	241.1063386190105
thus the poor woman was completely the dupe of the prisoner whom notwithstanding	173.19018658497117
but the presence of this woman did not prevent milady from thinking	101.69899119398151
there was no longer a doubt that felton was convinced felton was hers	82.18268267229493
if an angel appeared to that young man as an accuser of milady he would take him	111.11265384801261
milady smiled at this thought for felton was now her only hopeher only means of 	158.33544660781223
but lord de winter might suspect him felton himself might now be watched	324.90059306027626
toward four oclock in the morning the doctor arrived but since the time milady s	54.793156865092605
the doctor could therefore measure neither the direction nor the depth of it he 	460.26287356315413
in the morning milady under the pretext that she had not slept well in the night	82.9032729012399
she had one hope which was that felton would appear at the breakfast hour but fe	102.02597638724737
were her fears realized was felton suspected by the baron about to fail her at t	449.83871298793895
lord de winter had announced her embarkation for the twentythird and it was now 	108.5120295439998
nevertheless she still waited patiently till the hour for dinner	403.87302748596886
although she had eaten nothing in the morning the dinner was brought in at its u	82.9619582022306
milady then perceived with terror that the uniform of the soldiers who guarded h	138.05752951371184
then she ventured to ask what had become of felton	68.71933060006434
she was told that he had left the castle an hour before on horseback	53.63846418396403
she inquired if the baron was still at the castle	114.91805430825137
the soldier replied that he was and that he had given orders to be informed if t	58.84216357087067
milady replied that she was too weak at present and that her only desire was to 	91.1799499423814
the soldier went out leaving the dinner served	349.48497518347517
felton was sent away	61.77468615553904
the marines were removed	3459.894900894694
felton was then mistrusted	1942.1388098042844
this was the last blow to the prisoner	66.2366836838578
left alone she arose	186.43082253219487
the bed which she had kept from prudence and that they might believe her serious	299.73463963525813
she cast a glance at the door the baron had had a plank nailed over the grating	209.63849559612848
he no doubt feared that by this opening she might still by some diabolical means	387.432745788628
milady smiled with joy	42.169906398984146
she was free now to give way to her transports without being observed	485.7760054127219
she traversed her chamber with the excitement of a furious maniac or of a tigres	83.58604810204314
certes if the knife had been left in her power she would now have thought not of	127.15199314256849
at six oclock lord de winter came in	39.75134400448294
he was armed at all points	202.96984528991197
this man in whom milady till that time had only seen a very simple gentleman had	195.0024575402573
he appeared to foresee all to divine all to anticipate all	695.2476626721748
a single look at milady apprised him of all that was passing in her mind	78.92607672936643
ay said he i see but you shall not kill me today	45.83650708729019
you have no longer a weapon and besides i am on my guard	61.53508183874802
you had begun to pervert my poor felton	65.28684553154415
he was yielding to your infernal influence but i will save him	321.5214103069046
he will never see you again all is over	93.12517973899287
get your clothes together	370.12093495611913
tomorrow you will go	16.479985970931168
i had fixed the embarkation for the twentyfourth but i have reflected that the m	124.49635611155287
tomorrow by twelve oclock i shall have the order for your exile signed buckingha	126.60440631851405
if you speak a single word to anyone before going aboard ship my sergeant will b	572.312512156034
he has orders to do so	49.21733783395919
if when on the ship you speak a single word to anyone before the captain permits	284.8720137178541
that is agreed upon	391.4563070258643
au revoir then that is all i have to say today	41.42039860704907
tomorrow i will see you again to take my leave	38.85275825343479
with these words the baron went out	47.85849811049664
milady had listened to all this menacing tirade with a smile of disdain on her l	65.11991592419159
supper was served	2174.6173187396066
milady felt that she stood in need of all her strength	178.7870394000362
she did not know what might take place during this night which approached so men	159.18710641962525
the storm broke about ten oclock	341.72825536089067
milady felt a consolation in seeing nature partake of the disorder of her heart	611.5939328783734
the thunder growled in the air like the passion and anger in her thoughts	240.16978971814908
it appeared to her that the blast as it swept along disheveled her brow as it bo	226.82225187903592
she howled as the hurricane howled and her voice was lost in the great voice of 	383.2021367190433
all at once she heard a tap at her window and by the help of a flash of lightnin	97.54596434900031
she ran to the window and opened it	18.06158638863124
felton cried she	86.48602775176222
i am saved	56.69315306423948
yes said felton but silence silence i must have time to file through these bars	249.49627589310845
only take care that i am not seen through the wicket	117.93582821941243
oh it is a proof that the lord is on our side felton replied milady	42.16834804395824
they have closed up the grating with a board	215.79350122410145
that is well god has made them senseless said felton	212.08699329935268
but what must i do asked milady	14.71656053688036
nothing nothing only shut the window	372.22320033009476
go to bed or at least lie down in your clothes	120.65984950179278
as soon as i have done i will knock on one of the panes of glass	72.88367030207935
but will you be able to follow me	31.584365311717868
oh yes	12.642107166746133
your wound	13072.720435641504
gives me pain but will not prevent my walking	281.06274552194714
be ready then at the first signal	76.86444376430696
milady shut the window extinguished the lamp and went as felton had desired her 	181.89085525038206
amid the moaning of the storm she heard the grinding of the file upon the bars a	162.73149521430162
she passed an hour without breathing panting with a cold sweat upon her brow and	220.38630261225836
there are hours which last a year	411.48518063838924
at the expiration of an hour felton tapped again	46.21444836102764
milady sprang out of bed and opened the window	37.0226036296583
two bars removed formed an opening for a man to pass through	451.1886513140103
are you ready asked felton	10.317744352925402
must i take anything with me	49.40754237491149
money if you have any	35.894806966730364
yes fortunately they have left me all i had	91.43303808757997
so much the better for i have expended all mine in chartering a vessel	88.96216392809764
here said milady placing a bag full of louis in feltons hands	62.7924523554702
felton took the bag and threw it to the foot of the wall	23.52356896889441
now said he will you come	21.333404361802415
i am ready	23.96162495391304
milady mounted upon a chair and passed the upper part of her body through the wi	54.64180117251709
she saw the young officer suspended over the abyss by a ladder of ropes	143.03262867635544
for the first time an emotion of terror reminded her that she was a woman	70.63298963464987
the dark space frightened her	3993.857735059558
i expected this said felton	93.47027138331332
its nothing its nothing said milady	717.0172831123851
i will descend with my eyes shut	167.33319610870956
have you confidence in me said felton	22.477064243866497
you ask that	193.43530642825783
put your two hands together	103.47735520338912
cross them that s right	163.00836172429715
felton tied her two wrists together with his handkerchief and then with a cord o	149.1635014937195
what are you doing asked milady with surprise	11.026310608407242
pass your arms around my neck and fear nothing	155.0295614898022
but i shall make you lose your balance and we shall both be dashed to pieces	192.89223999497554
do nt be afraid	29.745859424995572
i am a sailor	44.2890043236612
not a second was to be lost	97.9488571399207
milady passed her two arms round feltons neck and let herself slip out of the wi	122.85656212298676
felton began to descend the ladder slowly step by step	207.858350820513
despite the weight of two bodies the blast of the hurricane shook them in the ai	175.32229688445057
all at once felton stopped	66.00991980595686
what is the matter asked milady	4.147609734890283
silence said felton i hear footsteps	163.48007730901062
we are discovered	106.74232853061035
there was a silence of several seconds	111.43435240851679
no said felton it is nothing	10.5815157995539
but what then is the noise	84.03788745974765
that of the patrol going their rounds	429.6289808012544
where is their road	325.8067694479215
just under us	935.7944568218077
they will discover us	179.91120038713024
no if it does not lighten	703.8842479536622
but they will run against the bottom of the ladder	81.2696235094045
fortunately it is too short by six feet	133.9404280046498
here they are my god	92.4097268996778
both remained suspended motionless and breathless within twenty paces of the gro	518.2977029242377
this was a terrible moment for the fugitives	67.43260884663123
the patrol passed	2438.31205551576
the noise of their retreating footsteps and the murmur of their voices soon died	482.9838127124598
now said felton we are safe	19.030428532280396
milady breathed a deep sigh and fainted	84.10270949739916
felton continued to descend	104.88964547858325
near the bottom of the ladder when he found no more support for his feet he clun	50.46116800636917
he stooped down picked up the bag of money and placed it between his teeth	180.0665443196334
then he took milady in his arms and set off briskly in the direction opposite to	62.79595564081427
he soon left the pathway of the patrol descended across the rocks and when arriv	212.08820687433487
a similar signal replied to him and five minutes after a boat appeared rowed by 	159.9893255387961
the boat approached as near as it could to the shore but there was not depth eno	157.379416187539
felton walked into the sea up to his middle being unwilling to trust his preciou	234.28072611563078
fortunately the storm began to subside but still the sea was disturbed	82.76558104774347
the little boat bounded over the waves like a nutshell	204.59775392003303
to the sloop said felton and row quickly	316.74776237537264
the four men bent to their oars but the sea was too high to let them get much ho	175.41361205948627
however they left the castle behind that was the principal thing	138.1835215958617
the night was extremely dark	536.5895683978387
it was almost impossible to see the shore from the boat they would therefore be 	79.28192403138117
a black point floated on the sea	586.4440810670574
that was the sloop	135.01127784127038
while the boat was advancing with all the speed its four rowers could give it fe	239.05111939799554
when her hands were loosed he took some sea water and sprinkled it over her face	298.1510879859037
milady breathed a sigh and opened her eyes	45.34890947341415
where am i said she	56.80436929167056
saved replied the young officer	110.55424713229426
oh saved saved cried she	10842.276554667138
yes there is the sky here is the sea the air i breathe is the air of liberty ah 	201.15105990372854
the young man pressed her to his heart	25.113609017285743
but what is the matter with my hands asked milady it seems as if my wrists had b	43.044725136402434
milady held out her arms her wrists were bruised	757.5678655438006
alas said felton looking at those beautiful hands and shaking his head sorrowful	147.236081669505
oh its nothing nothing cried milady	203.51246048379568
i remember now	346.7202890931701
milady looked around her as if in search of something	72.37002279444333
it is there said felton touching the bag of money with his foot	80.16401215820078
they drew near to the sloop	234.73763348598195
a sailor on watch hailed the boat the boat replied	1210.69218049014
what vessel is that asked milady	72.87744966560227
the one i have hired for you	147.18041753998764
where will it take me	74.67345368905366
where you please after you have put me on shore at portsmouth	104.19981245246326
what are you going to do at portsmouth asked milady	6.486477495065137
accomplish the orders of lord de winter said felton with a gloomy smile	29.36971010796964
what orders asked milady	277.3250428193715
you do not understand asked felton	16.001735903314433
no explain yourself i beg	763.2325371581027
as he mistrusted me he determined to guard you himself and sent me in his place 	195.36981262360777
but if he mistrusted you how could he confide such an order to you	148.4162729672394
how could i know what i was the bearer of	29.286333439016563
that s true and you are going to portsmouth	21.941663028431563
i have no time to lose	21.993356759405707
tomorrow is the twentythird and buckingham sets sail tomorrow with his fleet	164.996556885664
he sets sail tomorrow where for	9110.985273686472

he need not sail cried milady forgetting her usual presence of mind	421.79942922538527
be satisfied replied felton he will not sail	75.99811244463811
milady started with joy	92.46147297792781
she could read to the depths of the heart of this young man the death of bucking	39.70343590958776
felton cried she you are as great as judas maccabeus if you die i will die with 	57.26930427288558
silence cried felton we are here	19.865320536990826
in fact they touched the sloop	177.34876701259043
felton mounted the ladder first and gave his hand to milady while the sailors su	55.58862912567269
an instant after they were on the deck	38.2514508374654
captain said felton this is the person of whom i spoke to you and whom you must 	22.577634903542556
for a thousand pistoles said the captain	20.27042450624691
i have paid you five hundred of them	69.77092134349776
that s correct said the captain	82.78128988869418
and here are the other five hundred replied milady placing her hand upon the bag	77.24609059965367
no said the captain i make but one bargain and i have agreed with this young man	101.52136800617443
and shall we arrive there	206.25770003732737

hurrah for you then my beautiful lady cried the captain and may god often send m	260.5710966301403
meanwhile said felton convey me to the little bay of you know it was agreed you 	102.07853167743095
the captain replied by ordering the necessary maneuvers and toward seven oclock 	539.5429380586135
during this passage felton related everything to miladyhow instead of going to l	83.2132232983978
milady knew the rest	244.42290364525263
on her side milady tried to encourage felton in his project but at the first wor	75.17544854895529
it was agreed that milady should wait for felton till ten oclock if he did not r	43.07661277059813

what took place at portsmouth august 23 1628	1118.010653636305
felton took leave of milady as a brother about to go for a mere walk takes leave	310.28748449001216
his whole body appeared in its ordinary state of calmness only an unusual fire b	427.3508192132215
as long as he remained in the boat which conveyed him to land he kept his face t	59.35371360671406
both were free from the fear of pursuit nobody ever came into miladys apartment 	654.2047474844729
felton jumped onshore climbed the little ascent which led to the top of the clif	124.77693155245669
at the end of a hundred paces the ground began to decline and he could only see 	39.50330933399427
he immediately ran in the direction of portsmouth which he saw at nearly half a 	102.81377185645196
beyond portsmouth the sea was covered with vessels whose masts like a forest of 	211.5784096870595

the whole population was on foot drums were beating in the streets and in the po	201.4955982355623
felton arrived at the palace of the admiralty covered with dust and streaming wi	274.0295508718554
his countenance usually so pale was purple with heat and passion	1471.0401487442862
the sentinel wanted to repulse him but felton called to the officer of the post 	180.02859712936507
at the name of lord de winter who was known to be one of his graces most intimat	71.6505617811111
felton darted into the palace	127.31124862868452
at the moment he entered the vestibule another man was entering likewise dusty o	284.3938597260353
felton and he addressed patrick the dukes confidential lackey at the same moment	183.11074139385263

patrick who knew lord de winter was in affairs of the service and in relations o	137.2657556435856
the other was forced to wait and it was easily to be seen how he cursed the dela	77.68814079822383
the valet led felton through a large hall in which waited the deputies from la r	192.53973415834102
lieutenant felton from lord de winter said patrick	46.63897439793271
from lord de winter repeated buckingham let him come in	51.83886431748599
felton entered	485.46710117962215
at that moment buckingham was throwing upon a couch a rich toilet robe worked wi	492.47271042240095
why did nt the baron come himself demanded buckingham	162.70069234973167

i know it and the duke put the quill to the paper	120.38451346494205
felton grew pale	368.63085896234264
and knowing that real name my lord replied felton will you sign it all the same	93.39457745154162
doubtless said buckingham and rather twice than once	188.78731990489908
i can not believe continued felton in a voice that became more sharp and rough t	104.61721654128353
i know it perfectly although i am astonished that you know it	43.14579742178829
and will your grace sign that order without remorse	854.0269978545173
buckingham looked at the young man haughtily	26.033716852617047
do you know sir that you are asking me very strange questions and that i am very	49.460272763909266

buckingham reflected that the young man coming from lord de winter undoubtedly s	132.51405420314836
without remorse said he	121.81413911884358
the baron knows as well as myself that milady de winter is a very guilty woman a	85.86337399978238
the duke put his pen to the paper	38.47409181880913
you will not sign that order my lord said felton making a step toward the duke	51.58725967120032
i will not sign this order and why not	96.00847182002529
because you will look into yourself and you will do justice to the lady	57.479250769087386
i should do her justice by sending her to tyburn said buckingham	97.00771173371682
this lady is infamous	993.632268996319
my lord milady de winter is an angel you know that she is and i demand her liber	46.89445494210343
bah are you mad to talk to me thus said buckingham	61.69626395084133
my lord excuse me i speak as i can i restrain myself	106.1863895492709
but my lord think of what you re about to do and beware of going too far	142.46270116957845
what do you say god pardon me cried buckingham i really think he threatens me	58.2882819399885
no my lord i still plead	195.45619064941016
and i say to you one drop of water suffices to make the full vase overflow one s	293.2755956052021
felton said buckingham you will withdraw and place yourself at once under arrest	232.15180974255523
you will hear me to the end my lord	24.123898350365504
you have seduced this young girl you have outraged defiled her	281.0458593629577
repair your crimes toward her let her go free and i will exact nothing else from	568.1138692787315

my lord continued felton becoming more excited as he spoke my lord beware all en	225.3129855154012
god will punish you hereafter but i will punish you here	273.5034665962822
ah this is too much cried buckingham making a step toward the door	34.711381913768015
felton barred his passage	2375.8745496670763
i ask it humbly of you my lord said he sign the order for the liberation of mila	155.89056920089

beware my lord you are in the hands of god	20.541340798986276

help shouted the duke and at the same time he sprang toward his sword	38.29270393812705
but felton did not give him time to draw it	38.53683996513557
he held the knife with which milady had stabbed herself open in his bosom at one	131.16352360995901
at that moment patrick entered the room crying a letter from france my lord	44.802287875738195
from france cried buckingham forgetting everything in thinking from whom that le	344.58702403825686
felton took advantage of this moment and plunged the knife into his side up to t	74.61074036773634
ah traitor cried buckingham you have killed me	39.73353037422031
murder screamed patrick	97.66706769396876
felton cast his eyes round for means of escape and seeing the door free he rushe	132.23152800187395
felton made no resistance	50.413620322234614
lord de winter placed him in the hands of the guards who led him while awaiting 	44.98641175493874
at the cry uttered by the duke and the scream of patrick the man whom felton had	58.22061501811582
he found the duke reclining upon a sofa with his hand pressed upon the wound	109.43373165834468
laporte said the duke in a dying voice laporte do you come from her	36.96000344382497
yes monseigneur replied the faithful cloak bearer of anne of austria but too lat	262.896311286313

patrick let no one enter	372.23278490555725
oh i can not tell what she says to me my god i am dying	36.94342307120919
and the duke swooned	39.368396723173845
meanwhile lord de winter the deputies the leaders of the expedition the officers	215.88015903837967
cries of despair resounded on all sides	243.56265091851873
the news which filled the palace with tears and groans soon became known and spr	333.41872348407514
the report of a cannon announced that something new and unexpected had taken pla	282.2666824096293

gentlemen said he leave me alone with patrick and laporteah is that you de winte	37.072403022430336

i do not know the man who deserves being regretted during the whole life of anot	117.91339211591828
the baron went out sobbing	398.40200842496137
there only remained in the closet of the wounded duke laporte and patrick	67.89346963118528
a physician was sought for but none was yet found	454.42845623228214
you will live my lord you will live repeated the faithful servant of anne of aus	60.78790757272828

obey laporte do you not see i have no time to lose	22.851693328417852
laporte broke the seal and placed the paper before the eyes of the duke but buck	67.65925922381935

your affectionate anne	1850.7706360408679
buckingham collected all his remaining strength to listen to the reading of the 	116.28520279036024
the queen charged me to tell you to watch over yourself for she had advice that 	200.0344437795222
and is that allis that all replied buckingham impatiently	117.97323121242573
she likewise charged me to tell you that she still loved you	109.92031219150077
ah said buckingham god be praised my death then will not be to her as the death 	115.80837813172106
laporte burst into tears	369.3184354966621
patrick said the duke bring me the casket in which the diamond studs were kept	219.67589665150365
patrick brought the object desired which laporte recognized as having belonged t	531.4930272724429
now the scent bag of white satin on which her cipher is embroidered in pearls	1115.3110554311868
patrick again obeyed	1479.6749481574454
here laporte said buckingham these are the only tokens i ever received from hert	158.47344562016156
you will restore them to her majesty and as a last memorialhe looked round for s	90.3569958023604
he still sought but his eyes darkened by death encountered only the knife which 	634.0101672606198

he had just strength enough to place the scent bag at the bottom of the silver c	210.10043495989774
patrick uttered a loud cry	46.38275136786218
buckingham tried to smile a last time but death checked his thought which remain	323.3246605840635
at this moment the dukes surgeon arrived quite terrified he was already on board	214.37990347460095
he approached the duke took his hand held it for an instant in his own and letti	41.09456457729465
dead dead cried patrick	37.1769889364643
at this cry all the crowd reentered the apartment and throughout the palace and 	115.18033857279252
as soon as lord de winter saw buckingham was dead he ran to felton whom the sold	112.38982620690057
wretch said he to the young man who since the death of buckingham had regained t	28.171174503794802

rather say that you have served as an instrument to that accursed woman but i sw	149.32298162320308
i do nt know what you mean replied felton quietly and i am ignorant of whom you 	29.22529410246968
i killed the duke of buckingham because he twice refused you yourself to appoint	229.63782877323155
de winter stupefied looked on while the soldiers bound felton and could not tell	359.89275477998615
one thing alone however threw a shade over the pallid brow of felton	194.834321256117
at every noise he heard the simple puritan fancied he recognized the step and vo	97.62553493932757
all at once he started	88.95635251415531
his eyes became fixed upon a point of the sea commanded by the terrace where he 	79.91585692790576

the baron drew out his watch	45.03487463341104
it wants ten minutes to nine said he	317.87696028448624
milady had hastened her departure by an hour and a half	97.09800090160702
as soon as she heard the cannon which announced the fatal event she had ordered 	104.26049714075084

on learning of the death of the duke was that such terrible news might discourag	191.27518129684532
he carried the strictness of this order so far as to detain in england the ambas	123.9470844634164

de trville for they were the first to whom he communicated it	68.01770557130598
it was then that dartagnan appreciated the favor the cardinal had conferred upon	174.73857108837808
it goes without saying that this impatience to return toward paris had for a cau	232.61244024396632

bonacieux to leave the convent and to retire either into lorraine or belgium	104.1296789498017
they had not long to wait for an answer	52.168381601657124
eight or ten days afterward aramis received the following letter	59.0726624634704
my dear cousin here is the authorization from my sister to withdraw our little s	181.21041514768473
my sister sends you this authorization with great pleasure for she is very parti	109.21207827667146

to this letter was added an order conceived in these terms	516.5309257403208
at the louvre august 10 1628	280.9846220446834
the superior of the convent of bthune will place in the hands of the person who 	57.142353142237575

at length the escort passed through paris on the twentythird in the night	68.0081708290469
the king thanked m	426.38763470158443
de trville and permitted him to distribute furloughs for four days on condition 	151.4271854168502
the first four furloughs granted as may be imagined were to our four friends	374.44612750719233

good lord said dartagnan who as we have often said never stumbled at anything	152.52739615595092
it appears to me that we are making a great trouble of a very simple thing	46.19391465795886

to this athos replied quietly we also have money leftfor i have not yet drunk al	262.1293592496383
we can therefore use up four horses as well as one	138.3804123713778
but consider dartagnan added he in a tone so solemn that it made the young man s	54.60062335970105

you terrify me athos cried dartagnan	167.80038321984895
my god what do you fear	59.442166772212445
everything replied athos	13.963216077169479
dartagnan examined the countenances of his companions which like that of athos w	55.89037598382232
on the evening of the twentyfifth as they were entering arras and as dartagnan w	25.684207587249983
at the moment he passed through the gateway into the street the wind blew open t	57.6346459162018
dartagnan who had his eyes fixed upon this man became very pale and let his glas	60.86395621996844
what is the matter monsieur said planchet	8.630943133321646

the three friends hastened toward dartagnan who instead of being ill ran toward 	171.49075229112015
they stopped him at the door	21.03447178082716
well where the devil are you going now cried athos	32.72042299069625
it is he cried dartagnan pale with anger and with the sweat on his brow it is he	32.39150553346861

the hostler enchanted with the good days work he had done returned to the yard	554.6048628400778
dartagnan unfolded the paper	477.9661568597555
well eagerly demanded all his three friends	382.5047624833636
nothing but one word said dartagnan	31.048824261743686
yes said aramis but that one word is the name of some town or village	73.15030021339008
armentires read porthos armentires i do nt know such a place	40.75200283143168

accordingly that same evening milady commenced her journey	492.23089564362954
night overtook her she stopped and slept at an inn	458.948370541003
at five oclock the next morning she again proceeded and in three hours after ent	44.9925257603023
she inquired for the convent of the carmelites and went thither immediately	101.44626478244263
the superior met her milady showed her the cardinals order	604.4421308726243
the abbess assigned her a chamber and had breakfast served	598.5669624649969
all the past was effaced from the eyes of this woman and her looks fixed on the 	71.45655901203232
the evernew passions which consumed her gave to her life the appearance of those	386.56893135208315
after breakfast the abbess came to pay her a visit	97.9328384103713
there is very little amusement in the cloister and the good superior was eager t	189.54772261148986
milady wished to please the abbess	50.929585495402705
this was a very easy matter for a woman so really superior as she was	88.04718363975171
she tried to be agreeable and she was charming winning the good superior by her 	279.41884352137157
the abbess who was the daughter of a noble house took particular delight in stor	149.84173820989247
milady on the contrary was quite conversant with all aristocratic intrigues amid	449.7717940241085
she made it her business therefore to amuse the good abbess with the worldly pra	251.7982947391115
but the abbess contented herself with listening and smiling without replying a w	242.45511323199707
milady however saw that this sort of narrative amused her very much and kept at 	409.12078462722724
but she was greatly embarrassed	378.7622584800918
she did not know whether the abbess was a royalist or a cardinalist she therefor	31.26217186806434
but the abbess on her part maintained a reserve still more prudent contenting he	539.4390093244552
milady began to think she should soon grow weary of a convent life she resolved 	610.1823220135691
desirous of seeing how far the discretion of the good abbess would go she began 	162.99437120479945
daiguillon marion de lorme and several other gay women	354.66573912862145
the abbess listened more attentively grew animated by degrees and smiled	559.0970280260556
good thought milady she takes a pleasure in my conversation	178.36026503227095
if she is a cardinalist she has no fanaticism at least	146.2668400050454
she then went on to describe the persecutions exercised by the cardinal upon his	440.7196447033608
the abbess only crossed herself without approving or disapproving	1989.0411407922795
this confirmed milady in her opinion that the abbess was rather royalist than ca	210.48629570951184
milady therefore continued coloring her narrations more and more	586.9966269070735
i am very ignorant of these matters said the abbess at length but however distan	73.0609902159527
and one of our boarders has suffered much from the vengeance and persecution of 	274.9419494020414
one of your boarders said milady oh my god poor woman i pity her then	130.17904726104422
and you have reason for she is much to be pitied	73.18225798783402
imprisonment menaces ill treatmentshe has suffered everything	5063.580016571814
but after all resumed the abbess monsieur cardinal has perhaps plausible motives	1816.7736475397828
good said milady to herself who knows i am about perhaps to discover something h	65.03541729877634
she tried to give her countenance an appearance of perfect candor	303.81420868947055
alas said milady i know it is so	10.474282509097959
it is said that we must not trust to the face but in what then shall we place co	61.02631940755686
you would then be tempted to believe said the abbess that this young person is i	71.90688573424949
the cardinal pursues not only crimes said she there are certain virtues which he	544.1748604637047
permit me madame to express my surprise said the abbess	65.93184262887614
at what said milady with the utmost ingenuousness	67.23649566339934
at the language you use	865.8031470825498
what do you find so astonishing in that language said milady smiling	50.96560091239654
you are the friend of the cardinal for he sends you hither and yet	70.81894790908197
and yet i speak ill of him replied milady finishing the thought of the superior	163.210814480856
at least you do nt speak well of him	67.75753742602667
that is because i am not his friend said she sighing but his victim	81.05212671129422
but this letter in which he recommends you to me	115.35501384902268
is an order for me to confine myself to a sort of prison from which he will rele	49.91741166447078
but why have you not fled	135.92336784360418
whither should i go do you believe there is a spot on the earth which the cardin	53.93710890669473
no that is true but shethat is another thing i believe she is detained in france	60.64748823089049
ah said milady with a sigh if she loves she is not altogether wretched	68.69708477686558
then said the abbess looking at milady with increasing interest i behold another	95.68845195181197
alas yes said milady	10.961738033184416
the abbess looked at her for an instant with uneasiness as if a fresh thought su	41.85063698618783
you are not an enemy of our holy faith said she hesitatingly	146.14859951546777
whoi cried milady i a protestant oh no i call to witness the god who hears us th	98.79350692777889
then madame said the abbess smiling be reassured the house in which you are shal	56.13510976872292
you will find here moreover the young woman of whom i spoke who is persecuted no	185.28058949759955
she is amiable and wellbehaved	2337.666332098075
what is her name	23.154850528827232
she was sent to me by someone of high rank under the name of kitty	73.34187171249314
i have not tried to discover her other name	177.57309451236426
kitty cried milady	17.751238834995366
what are you sure	10.4532866105391
that she is called so yes madame	125.2939688865316
do you know her	14.44525933793783
milady smiled to herself at the idea which had occurred to her that this might b	82.65578142294625
there was connected with the remembrance of this girl a remembrance of anger and	114.08907290270264
and when can i see this young lady for whom i already feel so great a sympathy a	118.38804462728407
why this evening said the abbess today even	109.33582973246648
but you have been traveling these four days as you told me yourself	110.28009346561566
this morning you rose at five oclock you must stand in need of repose	237.51925626256198
go to bed and sleep at dinnertime we will rouse you	360.144938534008
although milady would very willingly have gone without sleep sustained as she wa	347.7368973502034
during the last fifteen days she had experienced so many and such various emotio	169.83844148673114
she therefore took leave of the abbess and went to bed softly rocked by the idea	131.22789680899135
she remembered that almost unlimited promise which the cardinal had given her if	270.4248342485412
she had succeeded dartagnan was then in her power	100.35224504539904
one thing alone frightened her that was the remembrance of her husband the comte	133.85531931458868
but alas if he was the friend of dartagnan he must have lent him his assistance 	58.86141459652423
all these hopes were so many sweet thoughts for milady so rocked by them she soo	282.58544920707703
she was awakened by a soft voice which sounded at the foot of her bed	60.52944033224524
she opened her eyes and saw the abbess accompanied by a young woman with light h	44.133548916564436
the face of the young woman was entirely unknown to her	44.655410137786674
each examined the other with great attention while exchanging the customary comp	354.8091800244755
milady however smiled in observing that she excelled the young woman by far in h	292.6478064032269
it is true that the habit of a novice which the young woman wore was not very ad	169.90356613453488
the abbess introduced them to each other	53.423246213285466
when this formality was ended as her duties called her to chapel she left the tw	254.39895232199066
the novice seeing milady in bed was about to follow the example of the superior 	291.4903400437739
how madame said she i have scarcely seen you and you already wish to deprive me 	73.65996658639828
no madame replied the novice only i thought i had chosen my time ill you were as	226.29484216954606
well said milady what can those who sleep wish fora happy awakening this awakeni	377.203217433939
the novice sat down	7221.245985290997
how unfortunate i am said she i have been here six months without the shadow of 	64.26672932496906
you arrive and your presence was likely to afford me delightful company yet i ex	492.228548509411
how you are going soon asked milady	24.8300114469192
at least i hope so said the novice with an expression of joy which she made no e	71.47659682881523
i think i learned you had suffered persecutions from the cardinal continued mila	224.68792266707865
what i have heard then from our good mother is true you have likewise been a vic	143.79765734399115
hush said milady let us not even here speak thus of him	83.74071635714499
all my misfortunes arise from my having said nearly what you have said before a 	413.45296611700434
are you also the victim of a treachery	179.46342863777673
no said the novice but of my devotionof a devotion to a woman i loved for whom i	336.15074967269913
and who has abandoned youis that it	805.6627032327091
i have been sufficiently unjust to believe so but during the last two or three d	145.81447443936887
but you madame you appear to be free continued the novice and if you were inclin	114.13951462013391
whither would you have me go without friends without money in a part of france w	66.22815652254418
oh cried the novice as to friends you would have them wherever you want you appe	330.46882029997073
that does not prevent replied milady softening her smile so as to give it an ang	117.22188637419998
hear me said the novice we must trust in heaven	588.3832161398748
there always comes a moment when the good you have done pleads your cause before	219.63630485946342
oh when i said i was alone said milady hoping to make the novice talk by talking	279.7782822371676
the queen herself does not dare to oppose the terrible minister	245.77558167443436
i have proof that her majesty notwithstanding her excellent heart has more than 	190.80322046789186
trust me madame the queen may appear to have abandoned those persons but we must	92.73217855121044
the more they are persecuted the more she thinks of them and often when they lea	388.3229317258078
alas said milady i believe so the queen is so good	25.531585292751625
oh you know her then that lovely and noble queen that you speak of her thus crie	182.9269503967937
that is to say replied milady driven into her entrenchment that i have not the h	33.708499788359056
i am acquainted with monsieur de putange i met monsieur dujart in england i know	43.066169177476134
monsieur de trville exclaimed the novice do you know monsieur de trville	51.11243991942721
yes perfectly wellintimately even	1059.0418240327467
the captain of the kings musketeers	45.33606660951274
the captain of the kings musketeers	44.96784957821556
why then only see cried the novice we shall soon be well acquainted almost frien	443.0481586583235
if you know monsieur de trville you must have visited him	29.646384012626015
often said milady who having entered this track and perceiving that falsehood su	208.66521884207665
with him then you must have seen some of his musketeers	37.21032246269814
all those he is in the habit of receiving replied milady for whom this conversat	62.680450358716946
name a few of those whom you know and you will see if they are my friends	66.58511692084251
well said milady embarrassed i know monsieur de louvigny monsieur de courtivron 	33.54337298307431
the novice let her speak then seeing that she paused she said do nt you know a g	299.14865057994183
milady became as pale as the sheets in which she was lying and mistress as she w	95.4147578665702
what is the matter good god asked the poor woman have i said anything that has w	63.386807269836545
no but the name struck me because i also have known that gentleman and it appear	174.6113849427647
oh yes very well not only him but some of his friends messieurs porthos and aram	96.59685175964441
indeed you know them likewise i know them cried milady who began to feel a chill	96.50141454921224
well if you know them you know that they are good and free companions	67.92510652410095
why do you not apply to them if you stand in need of help	115.04761306567855
that is to say stammered milady i am not really very intimate with any of them	60.24868229122488
i know them from having heard one of their friends monsieur dartagnan say a grea	130.02860430680377
you know monsieur dartagnan cried the novice in her turn seizing the hands of mi	97.95754477694764
then remarking the strange expression of miladys countenance she said pardon me 	283.27322627498296
why replied milady embarrassed why by the title of friend	353.02403429669533
you deceive me madame said the novice you have been his mistress	314.1253465225569
it is you who have been his mistress madame cried milady in her turn	46.32121843795601
i said the novice	4859.451447010197
yes you i know you now	67.4866820172452
you are madame bonacieux	48.45881093688234
the young woman drew back filled with surprise and terror	72.53900189526779
oh do not deny it answer continued milady	77.5106409719009
well yes madame said the novice are we rivals	2763.0327738795536
the countenance of milady was illumined by so savage a joy that under any other 	176.1667631996017
bonacieux would have fled in terror but she was absorbed by jealousy	303.1272889861535
speak madame resumed mme	41.291026043948996
bonacieux with an energy of which she might not have been believed capable	120.64724997282755
have you been or are you his mistress	320.2625721177523
oh no cried milady with an accent that admitted no doubt of her truth	60.53994726187495
never never	177.34986638026479
i believe you said mme	13.055631708642654
bonacieux but why then did you cry out so	190.372361697189
do you not understand said milady who had already overcome her agitation and rec	45.24709899278536
how can i understand i know nothing	40.91489621525953
can you not understand that monsieur dartagnan being my friend might take me int	55.026184961132245
do you not perceive that i know allyour abduction from the little house at st	80.94043180196516
germain his despair that of his friends and their useless inquiries up to this m	396.0374319216897
and milady stretched out her arms to mme	57.807383427704
bonacieux who convinced by what she had just said saw nothing in this woman whom	253.23682620280968
oh pardon me pardon me cried she sinking upon the shoulders of milady	104.55368187226966
pardon me i love him so much	28.899922430716117
these two women held each other for an instant in a close embrace	142.59169353737636
certainly if miladys strength had been equal to her hatred mme	202.53217864735615
bonacieux would never have left that embrace alive	720.2761401317897
but not being able to stifle her she smiled upon her	222.47945211892232
oh you beautiful good little creature said milady	208.81143456196122
how delighted i am to have found you let me look at you and while saying these w	98.17250522780097
oh yes it is you indeed from what he has told me i know you now	49.61393992150655

then you know what i have suffered said mme	18.343806235096856
bonacieux since he has told you what he has suffered but to suffer for him is ha	89.49178415202003
milady replied mechanically yes that is happiness	825.6065561128064
she was thinking of something else	130.5226461338548
and then continued mme	36.65944924117953
bonacieux my punishment is drawing to a close	485.4228888411827
tomorrow this evening perhaps i shall see him again and then the past will no lo	56.532613155715836
this evening asked milady roused from her reverie by these words	119.06990643366824
what do you mean do you expect news from him	36.900482629671366
i expect himself	3143.976368325569
himself dartagnan here	266.13569479281614
but that s impossible he is at the siege of la rochelle with the cardinal	38.42129195726584
he will not return till after the taking of the city	70.02569642970285
ah you fancy so but is there anything impossible for my dartagnan the noble and 	219.9777828280669

ah i always thought there was some secret understanding in that quarter and she 	182.84698130298827
my dear child hold yourself ready	380.73855135970655
our friend will see you soon and he will only see you to release you from that i	75.96825760166365
prepare then for your departure and never despair of us	234.32664496865127
our charming gascon has just proved himself as brave and faithful as ever	135.0251199055234
tell him that certain parties are grateful for the warning he has given	213.12500508941298
yes yes said milady the letter is precise	88.30041775753193
do you know what that warning was	95.48280058302473
no i only suspect he has warned the queen against some fresh machinations of the	119.29990462311179
yes that s it no doubt said milady returning the letter to mme	31.24329044736979
bonacieux and letting her head sink pensively upon her bosom	600.1222295420611
at that moment they heard the gallop of a horse	47.00540720026067
oh cried mme	7.353709836431725
bonacieux darting to the window can it be he	194.47205320379175
milady remained still in bed petrified by surprise so many unexpected things hap	380.3573052075671
he he murmured she can it be he and she remained in bed with her eyes fixed	120.66048238954978
alas no said mme	16.197231707491483
bonacieux it is a man i do nt know although he seems to be coming here	36.11800575432709

milady sprang out of bed	43.67395788616451

yes yes very sure	204.3961971353094

bonacieux somebody is coming	1752.0112411418145
immediately the door opened and the superior entered	49.32872859198391

yes replied she trying to recover her selfpossession	158.04383161204217
who wants me	63.63586721786839
a man who will not tell his name but who comes from the cardinal	38.48075194840817

the superior and mme	265.15299707441784
bonacieux retired	1196.1867111637237
milady remained alone with her eyes fixed upon the door	38.45554860759582
an instant later the jingling of spurs was heard upon the stairs steps drew near	321.3299789367817
milady uttered a cry of joy this man was the comte de rochefortthe demoniacal to	21.624466010229472
chapter lxii	2.86079733165032
two varieties of demons	6845.798468838622
ah cried milady and rochefort together it is you	62.04660638165766
yes it is i	18.987713359923134
and you come asked milady	29.75074619061592
from la rochelle and you	41.58979100844232
from england	10.358946792197493
dead or desperately wounded as i left without having been able to hear anything 	395.58446228983786
a fanatic has just assassinated him	126.32743176731992
ah said rochefort with a smile this is a fortunate chanceone that will delight h	62.829830810814606
i wrote to him from boulogne	63.11133077448159
but what brings you here	99.69367948907454
his eminence was uneasy and sent me to find you	82.75054598013173
i only arrived yesterday	975.4252552669942
and what have you been doing since yesterday	59.9728582558669
i have not lost my time	90.18795707203286
oh i do nt doubt that	25.235438882228284
do you know whom i have encountered here	67.89039415857819
how can i	9.624140689429899
that young woman whom the queen took out of prison	60.36350570917232
the mistress of that fellow dartagnan	217.9100400613331
yes madame bonacieux with whose retreat the cardinal was unacquainted	716.2979436703549
well well said rochefort here is a chance which may pair off with the other mons	79.63090773411422
imagine my astonishment continued milady when i found myself face to face with t	165.92122670687132
does she know you	41.63184524271345
then she looks upon you as a stranger	149.38266144745106
milady smiled	80.98714571763824
i am her best friend	221.90266634126618
upon my honor said rochefort it takes you my dear countess to perform such mirac	67.41659786968984
and it is well i can chevalier said milady for do you know what is going on here	50.10315387328959
they will come for her tomorrow or the day after with an order from the queen	83.06499510751507
indeed and who	95.36581532634128
dartagnan and his friends	32.66868765668015
indeed they will go so far that we shall be obliged to send them to the bastille	22.312363111310805
why is it not done already	91.39929894343217
what would you the cardinal has a weakness for these men which i can not compreh	78.0357275335167
well then tell him this rochefort	34.614078828586045
tell him that our conversation at the inn of the red dovecot was overheard by th	89.75888827071097
but these four men must be now at the siege of la rochelle	40.46221771656445
i thought so too but a letter which madame bonacieux has received from madame th	84.72241181123478
the devil what s to be done	124.31364768747225
what did the cardinal say about me	60.42334759488921
i was to take your dispatches written or verbal and return by post and when he s	796.2198760069346
i must then remain here	304.8907564847134
here or in the neighborhood	74.65426394044239
you can not take me with you	24.10553477896356
no the order is imperative	938.5906344035628
near the camp you might be recognized and your presence you must be aware would 	211.78765483960495
then i must wait here or in the neighborhood	81.00093340305791
only tell me beforehand where you will wait for intelligence from the cardinal l	113.08771077554977
observe it is probable that i may not be able to remain here	25.746271577826704
you forget that my enemies may arrive at any minute	191.8071097954556
that s true but is this little woman then to escape his eminence	122.57445991099839
bah said milady with a smile that belonged only to herself you forget that i am 	42.64658037985532
ah that s true i may then tell the cardinal with respect to this little woman	98.2348321734172
that he may be at ease	49.32149617772344
is that all	66.09098872606253
he will know what that means	81.31462747444168
he will guess at least	175.8615934302971
now then what had i better do	211.8172464562064
return instantly	11672.157969250338
it appears to me that the news you bear is worth the trouble of a little diligen	35.864584322587866
my chaise broke down coming into lilliers	671.8496370907854
what capital	12033.694280712474
yes i want your chaise	67.7228461092464
and how shall i travel then	100.25295411192297
on horseback	180.06353916003565
you talk very comfortablya hundred and eighty leagues	1661.530495768931
what s that	56.84441715167562
one can do it afterward	257.80184765193036
afterward why in passing through lilliers you will send me your chaise with an o	69.48555629843655
you have no doubt some order from the cardinal about you	102.85093984660568
i have my full power	180.54422840771826
show it to the abbess and tell her that someone will come and fetch me either to	111.33657188395665
very well	2.227338725217712
do nt forget to treat me harshly in speaking of me to the abbess	49.82793513471366
to what purpose	160.34874400791415
i am a victim of the cardinal	45.23162122075931
it is necessary to inspire confidence in that poor little madame bonacieux	109.23515054849766
that s true	26.620358825443077
now will you make me a report of all that has happened	51.67876187720205
why i have related the events to you	75.99735143524502
you have a good memory repeat what i have told you	38.88204105627879
a paper may be lost	226.56303895385054
you are right only let me know where to find you that i may not run needlessly a	107.8534388924176
that s correct wait	2947.976952966812
do you want a map	191.7793991879222
oh i know this country marvelously	67.44820552123488
you when were you here	288.93867434451096
i was brought up here	119.90265695638375
it is worth something you see to have been brought up somewhere	126.94177824504195
you will wait for me then	35.38953884380483
let me reflect a little ay that will doat armentires	89.80589538510951
where is that armentires	18.0842469913011
a little town on the lys i shall only have to cross the river and i shall be in 	59.09872364796751
capital but it is understood you will only cross the river in case of danger	162.71209726460043
that is well understood	74.06853168105128
and in that case how shall i know where you are	33.02580351949206
you do not want your lackey	72.53969368439694
is he a sure man	107.80135437462111
to the proof	199.2909763049712
give him to me	12.456336298204466
nobody knows him	473.2368325933448
i will leave him at the place i quit and he will conduct you to me	53.13117080238628
and you say you will wait for me at armentires	29.372427120044613
at armentires	21.373476058696845
write that name on a bit of paper lest i should forget it	220.21013984612847
there is nothing compromising in the name of a town	50.98142416049431
is it not so	8.935871919393573
eh who knows never mind said milady writing the name on half a sheet of paper i 	194.508500098676
well said rochefort taking the paper from milady folding it and placing it in th	51.665900169202416
i will do as children do for fear of losing the paperrepeat the name along the r	192.05183184490224
now is that all	87.66683327221938
i believe so	88.10879596244904
let us see buckingham dead or grievously wounded your conversation with the card	134.59462133588002
is that all then	97.61659746379044
in truth my dear chevalier you are a miracle of memory	112.01354746128104
a propos add one thing	7663.334053737168
i saw some very pretty woods which almost touch the convent garden	932.1448065379519
say that i am permitted to walk in those woods	118.11259842240244
who knows perhaps i shall stand in need of a back door for retreat	564.0081505355204
you think of everything	78.62857055827429
and you forget one thing	85.34843030501715
to ask me if i want money	71.52395337640309
that s true	32.1010659403845
how much do you want	13.849850533435175
all you have in gold	95.76500039047286
i have five hundred pistoles or thereabouts	74.3169901967525
i have as much	34.255523056709
with a thousand pistoles one may face everything	327.8459679230185
empty your pockets	193.35175762621986
and you go	53.350910321710096
in an hourtime to eat a morsel during which i shall send for a post horse	171.58375358612105
capital adieu chevalier	5712.268741608925
adieu countess	220979.71459713866
commend me to the cardinal	16.673272873756602
commend me to satan	14.239522264540996
milady and rochefort exchanged a smile and separated	53.97594604139247
an hour afterward rochefort set out at a grand gallop five hours after that he p	100.30239598065607
our readers already know how he was recognized by dartagnan and how that recogni	100.87412795557222
chapter lxiii	2.291245058799064
the drop of water	958.2301469251273
rochefort had scarcely departed when mme	156.59692928520394
bonacieux reentered	1793.9053942593384
she found milady with a smiling countenance	184.1755638193013
well said the young woman what you dreaded has happened	111.98203868295847
this evening or tomorrow the cardinal will send someone to take you away	143.30583877247108
who told you that my dear asked milady	27.451311123943075
i heard it from the mouth of the messenger himself	72.86615657098345
come and sit down close to me said milady	34.09794204687043
here i am	11.735834762642904
wait till i assure myself that nobody hears us	424.34857536240355
why all these precautions	159.85793382353617
you shall know	56.06807096146162
milady arose went to the door opened it looked in the corridor and then returned	64.9224792728834
then said she he has well played his part	211.58960860111506
who has	16.447143668330966
he who just now presented himself to the abbess as a messenger from the cardinal	111.57578395071928
it was then a part he was playing	132.7703379686242
yes my child	49.569755064657365
that man then was not	148.510852336305
that man said milady lowering her voice is my brother	89.89826879052752
your brother cried mme	32.66266745197443
no one must know this secret my dear but yourself	153.83426125832656
if you reveal it to anyone in the world i shall be lost and perhaps yourself lik	72.49519049862755
oh my god	28.532939687326728
this is what has happened my brother who was coming to my assistance to take me 	41.42953435253593
he followed him	220.41604463002346
at a solitary and retired part of the road he drew his sword and required the me	170.48487832776237
the messenger resisted my brother killed him	3786.584352699588
oh said mme	5.268144403752228
bonacieux shuddering	9240.184561937198
remember that was the only means	78.89172355673387
then my brother determined to substitute cunning for force	1532.6638413318738
he took the papers and presented himself here as the emissary of the cardinal an	119.066045663266
i understand	108.64198114067793
it is your brother who sends this carriage	107.74014995911813
exactly but that is not all	43.127274944525745
that letter you have received and which you believe to be from madame de chevreu	72.30172778176362
it is a forgery	96.43172630160852
how can that be	21.323112214657698
yes a forgery it is a snare to prevent your making any resistance when they come	262.2626356775167
but it is dartagnan that will come	34.67912941321241
do not deceive yourself	87.4802154532561
dartagnan and his friends are detained at the siege of la rochelle	39.768407091681226
how do you know that	6.414489206545687
my brother met some emissaries of the cardinal in the uniform of musketeers	356.79333994797645
you would have been summoned to the gate you would have believed yourself about 	91.60095977999674
oh my god my senses fail me amid such a chaos of iniquities	489.57548858071345
i feel if this continues said mme	760.6246584084442
bonacieux raising her hands to her forehead i shall go mad	109.14294273994827
i hear a horses steps it is my brother setting off again	337.4329375310785
i should like to offer him a last salute	174.1480693280624
milady opened the window and made a sign to mme	13.864912817150824
bonacieux to join her	246.93525737300843
the young woman complied	291.15805730619303
rochefort passed at a gallop	120.79801278376738
adieu brother cried milady	198.5411833718318
the chevalier raised his head saw the two young women and without stopping waved	121.54196452058291
the good george said she closing the window with an expression of countenance fu	58.58710838524897
and she resumed her seat as if plunged in reflections entirely personal	841.9736909510378
dear lady said mme	50.01260511283818
bonacieux pardon me for interrupting you but what do you advise me to do good he	107.92119153479481
speak i will listen	77.1084181600435
in the first place said milady it is possible i may be deceived and that dartagn	17.886441688825805
oh that would be too much cried mme	29.676481746959222
bonacieux so much happiness is not in store for me	125.65504816757038
then you comprehend it would be only a question of time a sort of race which sho	67.7540481102225
if your friends are the more speedy you are to be saved if the satellites of the	145.35269522910158
oh yes yes lost beyond redemption what then to do what to do	577.6467576187099
there would be a very simple means very natural	111.69571580128618
tell me what	4.990888355962574
to wait concealed in the neighborhood and assure yourself who are the men who co	163.32494578966504
but where can i wait	103.39153599475864
oh there is no difficulty in that	45.30945195475618
i shall stop and conceal myself a few leagues hence until my brother can rejoin 	294.04827475456864
well i take you with me we conceal ourselves and wait together	140.43042382367847
but i shall not be allowed to go i am almost a prisoner	49.4807011549358
as they believe that i go in consequence of an order from the cardinal no one wi	107.73090294471504
well the carriage is at the door you bid me adieu you mount the step to embrace 	138.40799681796491
but dartagnan dartagnan if he comes	50.297021559134336
shall we not know it	21.905382602135987
nothing easier	6270.487792236645
we will send my brothers servant back to bthune whom as i told you we can trust	144.23159237873782
he shall assume a disguise and place himself in front of the convent	268.5508996324929
if the emissaries of the cardinal arrive he will take no notice if it is monsieu	153.54961840760123
he knows them then	242.00730109310658
has he not seen monsieur dartagnan at my house	58.47973514268839
oh yes yes you are right	10.564837913645018
thus all may go wellall may be for the best but we do not go far from this place	119.38560665246719
seven or eight leagues at the most	31.63505473815598
we will keep on the frontiers for instance and at the first alarm we can leave f	164.99120697112747
and what can we do there	29.193405712895828
but if they come	76.91467316653981
my brothers carriage will be here first	203.45540760806935
if i should happen to be any distance from you when the carriage comes for youat	331.47175884745275
do one thing	1056.8237069550091
what is that	7.2182605181466934
tell your good superior that in order that we may be as much together as possibl	88.3285904425552
will she permit it	323.1118174654135
what inconvenience can it be	486.4588847451205
oh delightful in this way we shall not be separated for an instant	71.94752834769655
well go down to her then to make your request	115.66505603782466
i feel my head a little confused i will take a turn in the garden	98.78540461264726
go and where shall i find you	51.17881221948652
here in an hour	37.56542536811
here in an hour	29.882893014580425
oh you are so kind and i am so grateful	42.87055163881508
how can i avoid interesting myself for one who is so beautiful and so amiable ar	292.1926846529997
dear dartagnan oh how he will thank you	86.58728933691971
i hope so	96.04789684288869
now then all is agreed let us go down	50.16657692520283
you are going into the garden	31.503826195356
go along this corridor down a little staircase and you are in it	95.038057823235
excellent thank you	216.02555881163548
and the two women parted exchanging charming smiles	919.7636242318908
milady had told the truthher head was confused for her illarranged plans clashed	326.48903297524265
she required to be alone that she might put her thoughts a little into order	128.7851759906409
she saw vaguely the future but she stood in need of a little silence and quiet t	552.7251273804546
what was most pressing was to get mme	470.15271865152545
bonacieux away and convey her to a place of safety and there if matters required	490.80356094553343
milady began to have doubts of the issue of this terrible duel in which her enem	104.79470945038837
besides she felt as we feel when a storm is coming onthat this issue was near an	325.7064244276474
the principal thing for her then was as we have said to keep mme	91.45078446827785
bonacieux in her power	262.5778424449415
bonacieux was the very life of dartagnan	57.372704169587564
this was more than his life the life of the woman he loved this was in case of i	93.4164016634609
now this point was settled mme	197.4273812239255
bonacieux without any suspicion accompanied her	609.8440321295967
once concealed with her at armentires it would be easy to make her believe that 	78.59378472889098
in fifteen days at most rochefort would be back besides during that fifteen days	451.87311118942
she would not be weary thank god for she should enjoy the sweetest pastime such 	1355.7770935943042
revolving all this in her mind she cast her eyes around her and arranged the top	110.2142233306119
milady was like a good general who contemplates at the same time victory and def	55.814313651599335
at the end of an hour she heard a soft voice calling her it was mme	38.353510266008406
the good abbess had naturally consented to her request and as a commencement the	339.4927730074002
on reaching the courtyard they heard the noise of a carriage which stopped at th	29.22532894175591
milady listened	301.6804151005777
do you hear anything said she	29.383711010931552
yes the rolling of a carriage	145.09059511534238

oh my god	28.181385481616196

the bell of the convent gate was sounded milady was not mistaken	112.66036036325062

bonacieux you have perhaps some jewels you would like to take	177.53719659868938

great god said mme	23.374610893573685
bonacieux placing her hand upon her bosom my heart beats so i can not walk	150.04329150013115
courage courage remember that in a quarter of an hour you will be safe and think	48.59644623529616
yes yes everything for him	180.03460633237944
you have restored my courage by a single word go i will rejoin you	133.6269491795818
milady ran up to her apartment quickly she there found rocheforts lackey and gav	153.18272191714985
he was to wait at the gate if by chance the musketeers should appear the carriag	70.48266564542554
in this case milady would cross the garden and gain the village on foot	129.76170994952818
as we have already said milady was admirably acquainted with this part of france	42.35211707143464
if the musketeers did not appear things were to go on as had been agreed mme	97.88031723050135
bonacieux was to get into the carriage as if to bid her adieu and she was to tak	57.03425530843964
bonacieux came in and to remove all suspicion if she had any milady repeated to 	212.66564355109833
milady asked some questions about the carriage	208.64412605027096
it was a chaise drawn by three horses driven by a postillion rocheforts lackey w	116.9620359848712
milady was wrong in fearing that mme	272.69867828988953
bonacieux would have any suspicion	65.08399913659005
the poor young woman was too pure to suppose that any female could be guilty of 	317.53609819045846
you see said she when the lackey had gone out everything is ready	103.34032501930238
the abbess suspects nothing and believes that i am taken by order of the cardina	211.12580446333916
this man goes to give his last orders take the least thing drink a finger of win	352.0947039172377
yes said mme	3.8363619273047433
bonacieux mechanically yes let us be gone	241.6991537884287
milady made her a sign to sit down opposite poured her a small glass of spanish 	79.06729610617356
see said she if everything does not second us here is night coming on by daybrea	301.3649679013211
come courage take something	986.0826525002022
bonacieux ate a few mouthfuls mechanically and just touched the glass with her l	143.5152289247507
come come said milady lifting hers to her mouth do as i do	88.19984431776602
but at the moment the glass touched her lips her hand remained suspended she hea	132.35113036882245
then it grew nearer and it seemed to her almost at the same time that she heard 	64.84701794055547
this noise acted upon her joy like the storm which awakens the sleeper in the mi	532.457971274781
bonacieux rising all in a tremble supported herself upon her chair to avoid fall	712.4606141744013
nothing was yet to be seen only they heard the galloping draw nearer	278.6528483258983
oh my god said mme	11.323906636121004
bonacieux what is that noise	156.32483994576248
that of either our friends or our enemies said milady with her terrible coolness	198.81535272936733
stay where you are i will tell you	39.52881296315803
bonacieux remained standing mute motionless and pale as a statue	138.6471822833699
the noise became louder the horses could not be more than a hundred and fifty pa	111.0173260083531
if they were not yet to be seen it was because the road made an elbow	102.95668215483761
the noise became so distinct that the horses might be counted by the rattle of t	152.922252387612
milady gazed with all the power of her attention it was just light enough for he	120.99078411496201
all at once at the turning of the road she saw the glitter of laced hats and the	228.7610988762649
one of them preceded the rest by double the length of his horse	205.68961966290294
milady uttered a stifled groan	131.3039466568061
in the first horseman she recognized dartagnan	319.93516999403573
oh my god my god cried mme	15.148860432280285
bonacieux what is it	35.89000625603344
it is the uniform of the cardinals guards	69.44706607382092
not an instant to be lost fly fly	855.4861327959803
yes yes let us fly repeated mme	123.39505820276669
bonacieux but without being able to make a step glued as she was to the spot by 	217.72215225276426
they heard the horsemen pass under the windows	217.07580823793757
come then come then cried milady trying to drag the young woman along by the arm	80.72720337617376
thanks to the garden we yet can flee i have the key but make haste in five minut	445.13483122178116
bonacieux tried to walk made two steps and sank upon her knees	149.03495983706023
milady tried to raise and carry her but could not do it	174.07384714754932
at this moment they heard the rolling of the carriage which at the approach of t	21.811872747289335
then three or four shots were fired	41.9749171591356
for the last time will you come cried milady	34.19365563704518
oh my god my god you see my strength fails me you see plainly i can not walk	82.13402588774458
flee alone	102.58615400505117
flee alone and leave you here no no never cried milady	103.54201321668812
all at once she paused a livid flash darted from her eyes she ran to the table e	192.98700079677386
bonacieuxs glass the contents of a ring which she opened with singular quickness	225.03124553944343
it was a grain of a reddish color which dissolved immediately	361.3581926968295
then taking the glass with a firm hand she said drink	185.75128965902357
this wine will give you strength drink and she put the glass to the lips of the 	99.33470500938633
this is not the way that i wished to avenge myself said milady replacing the gla	37.43746131582897
bonacieux saw her go without being able to follow her she was like people who dr	205.01759372250496
a few moments passed a great noise was heard at the gate	24.968282167648244
every instant mme	96.25531609479674
bonacieux expected to see milady but she did not return	36.11176317125006
several times with terror no doubt the cold sweat burst from her burning brow	262.5584360969188
at length she heard the grating of the hinges of the opening gates the noise of 	57.46478103859721
there was a great murmur of voices which continued to draw near amid which she s	111.68442511042711
all at once she uttered a loud cry of joy and darted toward the door she had rec	35.68819784877239
dartagnan dartagnan cried she is it you this way this way	139.35705426746227
constance constance replied the young man where are you where are you my god	39.32403459917172
at the same moment the door of the cell yielded to a shock rather than opened se	63.32665748351335
bonacieux had sunk into an armchair without the power of moving	156.7441007309886
dartagnan threw down a yetsmoking pistol which he held in his hand and fell on h	42.58199303264963
athos replaced his in his belt porthos and aramis who held their drawn swords in	104.66087535279334
oh dartagnan my beloved dartagnan you have come then at last you have not deceiv	59.60420445799723

oh it was in vain she told me you would not come i hoped in silence	106.8558930193013
i was not willing to fly	105.67969650618573
oh i have done well how happy i am	60.7563500858089
at this word she athos who had seated himself quietly started up	162.53273705953856
she what she asked dartagnan	143.9638937829374
why my companion	455.64918170194915
she who out of friendship for me wished to take me from my persecutors	302.7335225019953
she who mistaking you for the cardinals guards has just fled away	453.32749829587743
your companion cried dartagnan becoming more pale than the white veil of his mis	70.99154918695625
of what companion are you speaking dear constance	197.46767756023613
of her whose carriage was at the gate of a woman who calls herself your friend o	88.42475683838535
her name her name cried dartagnan	48.77962234147115
my god can you not remember her name	78.2989125221599
yes it was pronounced in my hearing once	333.76819971092954

she is ill great god she is losing her senses	327.3603007143193
while porthos was calling for help with all the power of his strong voice aramis	73.80077184942749
oh said athos oh no it is impossible god would not permit such a crime	58.757909268269515
water water cried dartagnan	87.77906196921617
oh poor woman poor woman murmured athos in a broken voice	85.48650572993934
bonacieux opened her eyes under the kisses of dartagnan	78.0233002714068
she revives cried the young man	20.881381755594724
oh my god my god i thank thee	49.321049331628195
madame said athos madame in the name of heaven whose empty glass is this	102.80181034817757
mine monsieur said the young woman in a dying voice	33.868285899011845
but who poured the wine for you that was in this glass	202.69352290991796
but who is she	115.39137825272746
oh i remember said mme	17.997704923722598
bonacieux the comtesse de winter	35.53782593877512
the four friends uttered one and the same cry but that of athos dominated all th	60.35818098496923
at that moment the countenance of mme	16.68579951382392
bonacieux became livid a fearful agony pervaded her frame and she sank panting i	1066.3895585491287
dartagnan seized the hands of athos with an anguish difficult to be described	166.34583839440268
and what do you believe his voice was stifled by sobs	71.93627644800668
i believe everything said athos biting his lips till the blood sprang to avoid s	111.62788231681472
dartagnan dartagnan cried mme	19.79260550764103
bonacieux where art thou do not leave me you see i am dying	79.44177144898619
dartagnan released the hands of athos which he still held clasped in both his ow	166.7299514394298
her beautiful face was distorted with agony her glassy eyes had no longer their 	605.7312726997102
in the name of heaven run call aramis porthos call for help	150.23809510481234
useless said athos useless for the poison which she pours there is no antidote	377.3293235307531
yes yes help help murmured mme	274.6666408999291
bonacieux help	27014.27302824755
then collecting all her strength she took the head of the young man between her 	63.29954682826887
constance constance cried dartagnan	20.157496998739635
a sigh escaped from the mouth of mme	39.550928798030164
bonacieux and dwelt for an instant on the lips of dartagnan	54.2018672378016
that sigh was the soul so chaste and so loving which reascended to heaven	1067.9981205838315
dartagnan pressed nothing but a corpse in his arms	139.627770906521
the young man uttered a cry and fell by the side of his mistress as pale and as 	36.65805082084466
porthos wept aramis pointed toward heaven athos made the sign of the cross	144.0206763233521
at that moment a man appeared in the doorway almost as pale as those in the cham	54.49409858426199
he looked around him and saw mme	22.61264027623193
bonacieux dead and dartagnan in a swoon	92.75159235028852
he appeared just at that moment of stupor which follows great catastrophes	558.56994531832
i was not deceived said he here is monsieur dartagnan and you are his friends me	44.2708460141483
the persons whose names were thus pronounced looked at the stranger with astonis	198.77857274330924
it seemed to all three that they knew him	109.34224257304405
gentlemen resumed the newcomer you are as i am in search of a woman who added he	97.6515606865811
the three friends remained mutefor although the voice as well as the countenance	88.73182257385353
gentlemen continued the stranger since you do not recognize a man who probably o	57.790957195712274
i am lord de winter brotherinlaw of that woman	264.9380186731496
the three friends uttered a cry of surprise	27.691216120914095
athos rose and offering him his hand be welcome my lord said he you are one of u	80.19222730510063
i set out five hours after her from portsmouth said lord de winter	96.5846463742128
i arrived three hours after her at boulogne	158.4055263202224
i missed her by twenty minutes at st	440.26448159839015
finally at lilliers i lost all trace of her	181.16021913490846
i was going about at random inquiring of everybody when i saw you gallop past	287.71588316215605
i recognized monsieur dartagnan	134.796489417597
i called to you but you did not answer me i wished to follow you but my horse wa	43.67150056211404
and yet it appears in spite of all your diligence you have arrived too late	132.04917873869826
you see said athos pointing to mme	21.962420176818803
bonacieux dead and to dartagnan whom porthos and aramis were trying to recall to	101.7157229511984
are they both dead asked lord de winter sternly	236.14456013942885
no replied athos fortunately monsieur dartagnan has only fainted	128.9047344512909
ah indeed so much the better said lord de winter	28.45621918943222
at that moment dartagnan opened his eyes	14.190447905696299
he tore himself from the arms of porthos and aramis and threw himself like a mad	55.55116125075501
athos rose walked toward his friend with a slow and solemn step embraced him ten	276.4788175151275
oh yes cried dartagnan yes if it be to avenge her i am ready to follow you	33.695458694621834
athos profited by this moment of strength which the hope of vengeance restored t	171.02715380957721
the two friends met her in the corridor greatly troubled and much upset by such 	292.6681807332916
madame said athos passing his arm under that of dartagnan we abandon to your pio	74.96718294165551
she was an angel on earth before being an angel in heaven	184.40949376132235
treat her as one of your sisters	325.2164830140728
we will return someday to pray over her grave	361.8692776981587
dartagnan concealed his face in the bosom of athos and sobbed aloud	97.1780864977123
weep said athos weep heart full of love youth and life alas would i could weep l	683.1570778697312
and he drew away his friend as affectionate as a father as consoling as a priest	122.66941631737524
all five followed by their lackeys leading their horses took their way to the to	136.37508782300952
but said dartagnan shall we not pursue that woman	105.29419700011151
later said athos	13.73182221893297
i have measures to take	355.0903096208664
she will escape us replied the young man she will escape us and it will be your 	46.24528808234668
i will be accountable for her said athos	170.56480859416797
dartagnan had so much confidence in the word of his friend that he lowered his h	43.83458704674976
porthos and aramis regarded each other not understanding this assurance of athos	143.06434671420192
lord de winter believed he spoke in this manner to soothe the grief of dartagnan	142.53289170452453
now gentlemen said athos when he had ascertained there were five chambers free i	211.42561888424328
dartagnan needs to be alone to weep and to sleep	127.8122123461463
i take charge of everything be easy	349.15500251270447
it appears however said lord de winter if there are any measures to take against	142.85343461651433
and me said athos she is my wife	71.81570355985305
dartagnan smiledfor he understood that athos was sure of his vengeance when he r	43.000156957836325
porthos and aramis looked at each other and grew pale	19.093686831482795
lord de winter thought athos was mad	89.44353399182286
now retire to your chambers said athos and leave me to act	161.00143355980165
you must perceive that in my quality of a husband this concerns me	252.47614202010638
only dartagnan if you have not lost it give me the paper which fell from that ma	90.91759063883092
ah said dartagnan i comprehend that name written in her hand	106.75403587556299

the man in the red cloak	78.65196968632713

planchet the most intelligent of the four was to follow that by which the carria	110.27599186147502
athos set the lackeys to work first because since these men had been in the serv	156.31060316903057
then lackeys who ask questions inspire less mistrust than masters and meet with 	8643.54056883895
besides milady knew the masters and did not know the lackeys on the contrary the	69.5619373602686
all four were to meet the next day at eleven oclock	34.484096842783266
if they had discovered miladys retreat three were to remain on guard the fourth 	174.3713415393492
these arrangements made the lackeys retired	837.5537487907638
athos then arose from his chair girded on his sword enveloped himself in his clo	75.82758342421849
it was nearly ten oclock	30.30994561680459
at ten oclock in the evening it is well known the streets in provincial towns ar	143.3499890446749
athos nevertheless was visibly anxious to find someone of whom he could ask a qu	144.20408500907521
at length he met a belated passenger went up to him and spoke a few words to him	85.23203406543645
the man he addressed recoiled with terror and only answered the few words of the	212.12522424727598
athos offered the man half a pistole to accompany him but the man refused	149.63895723715237
athos then plunged into the street the man had indicated with his finger but arr	144.5098489248676
nevertheless as the crossroads offered him a better chance than any other place 	371.1847385779188
in a few minutes a night watch passed	80.85279052341943
athos repeated to him the same question he had asked the first person he met	94.61866446691782
the night watch evinced the same terror refused in his turn to accompany athos a	259.03741317025685
athos walked in the direction indicated and reached the suburb situated at the o	111.11170016454757
there he again appeared uneasy and embarrassed and stopped for the third time	170.345192015536
fortunately a mendicant passed who coming up to athos to ask charity athos offer	1154.2357482801522
the mendicant hesitated at first but at the sight of the piece of silver which s	64.50389667408224

it was dark and silent as the tomb	56.85864933646588
three times athos knocked without receiving an answer	320.47139897137714
at the third knock however steps were heard inside	1023.1497867219166
the door at length was opened and a man appeared of high stature pale complexion	89.97653481413046
athos and he exchanged some words in a low voice then the tall man made a sign t	38.78016546138446
athos immediately profited by the permission and the door was closed behind him	96.37192197212752
the man whom athos had come so far to seek and whom he had found with so much tr	52.15407996424014
all the frame was adjusted except the head which lay on the table	207.6823978315309
all the rest of the furniture indicated that the dweller in this house occupied 	161.38644144148677
there were large bottles filled with serpents ticketed according to their specie	162.13788155811397
there was no family no servant the tall man alone inhabited this house	386.4528206218926
athos cast a cold and indifferent glance upon the objects we have described and 	171.1299403328361
then he explained to him the cause of his visit and the service he required of h	65.27638628829482
but scarcely had he expressed his request when the unknown who remained standing	218.17724629762003

satisfied with this discovery which confirmed all his suspicions athos returned 	271.192779965701
everything was as athos had foreseen	72.65514184324245
planchet had followed the road like athos he had discovered the stains of blood 	113.8592933335514
but he had gone farther than athosfor at the village of festubert while drinking	139.38044684944077

there was but one tavern the post	348.5069593042242
planchet went and presented himself as a lackey out of a place who was in search	129.47974206219595
he had not chatted ten minutes with the people of the tavern before he learned t	71.57690435970572

to wait replied athos	42.62635138226438
each retired to his own apartment	160.2773460445908
at eight oclock in the evening athos ordered the horses to be saddled and lord d	60.24644148568157
in an instant all five were ready	140.04845476181472
each examined his arms and put them in order	149.53652880536225
athos came down last and found dartagnan already on horseback and growing impati	247.13091411795273
patience cried athos one of our party is still wanting	78.65924583411929
the four horsemen looked round them with astonishment for they sought vainly in 	268.77265442643954
at this moment planchet brought out athoss horse the musketeer leaped lightly in	110.07110603676112

in a quarter of an hour he returned accompanied by a tall man masked and wrapped	53.91302823639614
lord de winter and the three musketeers looked at one another inquiringly	93.35739895941443
neither could give the others any information for all were ignorant who this man	409.75979305072656
at nine oclock guided by planchet the little cavalcade set out taking the route 	110.50070026917535
it was a melancholy sightthat of these six men traveling in silence each plunged	474.6889014174533

he had but one thoughtto go forward and he went	106.81330491717294
they passed in silence through the little village of festubert where the wounded	78.06021577515453

the cavalcade trotted on more sharply	1958.154428339812
a little before they came to fromelles the storm burst	142.2799468667763
they spread their cloaks	1481.0422569692594
there remained three leagues to travel and they did it amid torrents of rain	403.7347775168851
dartagnan took off his hat and could not be persuaded to make use of his cloak	39.44837281838309
he found pleasure in feeling the water trickle over his burning brow and over hi	338.91469671394293

has she left armentires	101.32095851568579
grimaud made a sign in the affirmative	11.528272801382636
dartagnan ground his teeth	1607.9551588774405

i have charged myself with this affair	87.75876400196903
it is for me then to interrogate grimaud	51.77248771130413
where is she asked athos	14.438596699697785
grimaud extended his hands in the direction of the lys	16.050927099222726
far from here asked athos	120.50839718020313
grimaud showed his master his forefinger bent	2188.3251153638525

lead us grimaud	59.29266918278412
grimaud took his course across the country and acted as guide to the cavalcade	114.61963332935314
at the end of five hundred paces more or less they came to a rivulet which they 	87.43550966816106
by the aid of the lightning they perceived the village of erquinheim	52.08809453821032
is she there grimaud asked athos	32.1684260037311
grimaud shook his head negatively	31.081864901886988
silence then cried athos	29.07201450284672
and the troop continued their route	171.7676960551303
another flash illuminated all around them	2811.5873004612044
grimaud extended his arm and by the bluish splendor of the fiery serpent they di	330.59049430955986
one window was lighted	402.33914596917634
here we are said athos	16.06358744693505
at this moment a man who had been crouching in a ditch jumped up and came toward	75.99825739967223
it was mousqueton	9.246340996062534
he pointed his finger to the lighted window	142.4455834576435
she is there said he	22.369436373179447
and bazin asked athos	20.331487478243968
while i watched the window he guarded the door	95.17615037976435

athos sprang from his horse gave the bridle to grimaud and advanced toward the w	38.986201248979185
the little house was surrounded by a low quickset hedge two or three feet high	173.4730180686004
athos sprang over the hedge and went up to the window which was without shutters	62.351052463437185
he mounted the skirting stone that his eyes might look over the curtain	165.17706073798047
by the light of a lamp he saw a woman wrapped in a dark mantle seated upon a sto	36.25099168475036
her elbows were placed upon a mean table and she leaned her head upon her two ha	238.03025900351116

milady raised her head saw close to the panes the pale face of athos and screame	116.19158695406075
athos perceiving that she knew him pushed the window with his knee and hand	90.32317995679584
the window yielded	2039.7987345245842
the squares were broken to shivers and athos like the spectre of vengeance leape	933.1258481326446
milady rushed to the door and opened it	21.840842348594222
more pale and menacing than athos dartagnan stood on the threshold	102.53881338193342
milady recoiled uttering a cry	382.3246011509246
dartagnan believing she might have means of flight and fearing she should escape	551.9355393785028
put back that weapon dartagnan said he this woman must be tried not assassinated	231.66712440539615

in front of them the lys rolled its waters like a river of molten tin while on t	602.3030058369003

from time to time a broad sheet of lightning opened the horizon in its whole wid	104.8497408774164
not a breath of wind now disturbed the heavy atmosphere	900.3409056389044
a deathlike silence oppressed all nature	2753.3134601421943
the soil was humid and glittering with the rain which had recently fallen and th	663.8852648649236
two lackeys dragged milady whom each held by one arm	1084.5580341450166
the executioner walked behind them and lord de winter dartagnan porthos and aram	68.42198420777558
planchet and bazin came last	108.56989315708839
the two lackeys conducted milady to the bank of the river	90.1428991235961
her mouth was mute but her eyes spoke with their inexpressible eloquence supplic	325.13120278041856
being a few paces in advance she whispered to the lackeys a thousand pistoles to	109.820979987256
grimaud hesitated	323.7767038048805
mousqueton trembled in all his members	430.9246408235621
athos who heard miladys voice came sharply up	993.7900571855461
lord de winter did the same	33.7884635329598
change these lackeys said he she has spoken to them	146.59473168051355
they are no longer sure	41.56990471187975
planchet and bazin were called and took the places of grimaud and mousqueton	30.24715504740237
on the bank of the river the executioner approached milady and bound her hands a	87.18496385923464
then she broke the silence to cry out you are cowards miserable assassinsten men	610.7613112104528
beware if i am not saved i shall be avenged	66.50182463302394
you are not a woman said athos coldly and sternly	65.87976919084622
you do not belong to the human species you are a demon escaped from hell whither	544.3697669384005
ah you virtuous men said milady please to remember that he who shall touch a hai	228.7192153026961
the executioner may kill without being on that account an assassin said the man 	203.72897991741897
this is the last judge that is all	64.95019210417037
nachrichter as say our neighbors the germans	1082.497053315396
and as he bound her while saying these words milady uttered two or three savage 	199.10414122131374
if i am guilty if i have committed the crimes you accuse me of shrieked milady t	123.58307533935478
you are not judges you can not condemn me	47.22037610956363
i offered you tyburn said lord de winter	51.87099621814311
why did you not accept it	21.943101683127477
because i am not willing to die cried milady struggling	74.3259563244877
because i am too young to die	73.11473046728841
the woman you poisoned at bthune was still younger than you madame and yet she i	281.7677754889428
i will enter a cloister i will become a nun said milady	77.38932256575356
you were in a cloister said the executioner and you left it to ruin my brother	46.42261229648355
milady uttered a cry of terror and sank upon her knees	33.58239080192503
the executioner took her up in his arms and was carrying her toward the boat	69.64335027922908
oh my god cried she my god are you going to drown me	60.06254915495641
these cries had something so heartrending in them that m	785.8291982630049
dartagnan who had been at first the most eager in pursuit of milady sat down on 	85.94652821899757
dartagnan was the youngest of all these men	90.2061500087004
his heart failed him	257.26888528602905
oh i can not behold this frightful spectacle said he	122.56610212378091
i can not consent that this woman should die thus	129.09406745378877
milady heard these few words and caught at a shadow of hope	143.17135315829648
dartagnan dartagnan cried she remember that i loved you	83.43293859354024
the young man rose and took a step toward her	25.978397554140294
but athos rose likewise drew his sword and placed himself in the way	104.25075340136607
if you take one step farther dartagnan said he we shall cross swords together	162.99211728897308
dartagnan sank on his knees and prayed	33.558699431575754
come continued athos executioner do your duty	245.8708796232786
willingly monseigneur said the executioner for as i am a good catholic i firmly 	77.89278487550592
that s well	92.85067039203435
athos made a step toward milady	47.534325998889756
i pardon you said he the ill you have done me	78.18180301498874
i pardon you for my blasted future my lost honor my defiled love and my salvatio	141.7055855456368
die in peace	242.45060442124137
lord de winter advanced in his turn	63.14784514638268
i pardon you said he for the poisoning of my brother and the assassination of hi	116.31204325461512
i pardon you for the death of poor felton i pardon you for the attempts upon my 	98.44016767399424

i pardon you and i weep for you	122.56095915336455
die in peace	211.82421573189274
i am lost murmured milady in english	57.12279271602029
i must die	112.30630787897114
then she arose of herself and cast around her one of those piercing looks which 	284.7791159762367
she saw nothing she listened and she heard nothing	90.47469600933914
where am i to die said she	52.352263610522954
on the other bank replied the executioner	122.63917899000658
then he placed her in the boat and as he was going to set foot in it himself ath	49.498671428762954
here said he is the price of the execution that it may be plain we act as judges	108.0964549133108
that is correct said the executioner and now in her turn let this woman see that	112.65439752934059
and he threw the money into the river	47.23625286117659
the boat moved off toward the lefthand shore of the lys bearing the guilty woman	268.22852261783703
the boat glided along the ferry rope under the shadow of a pale cloud which hung	281.2946977890592
the troop of friends saw it gain the opposite bank the figures were defined like	1182.025802570003
milady during the passage had contrived to untie the cord which fastened her fee	390.16227719636885
on coming near the bank she jumped lightly on shore and took to flight	282.93358085208047
but the soil was moist on reaching the top of the bank she slipped and fell upon	194.08870857484305
she was struck no doubt with a superstitious idea she conceived that heaven deni	462.50295516229676
then they saw from the other bank the executioner raise both his arms slowly a m	342.4041824992216
the two arms fell with a sudden force they heard the hissing of the scimitar and	479.6495095771939

prodigiously replied athos in the name of himself and his comrades	39.0330856877449
chapter lxvii	2.4841632726173666
on the sixth of the following month the king in compliance with the promise he h	90.76667457875632
although warned that the man she had loved so much was in great danger the queen	146.96532944784641
but the next day she was obliged to believe this fatal intelligence laporte deta	73.53005294380011
arrived and was the bearer of the dukes dying gift to the queen	204.31765648542722
the joy of the king was lively	136.1738425427575
he did not even give himself the trouble to dissemble and displayed it with affe	62.558355890477095
louis xiii	1.8797083440189208
like every weak mind was wanting in generosity	1074.480749492569
but the king soon again became dull and indisposed his brow was not one of those	139.8177854128116
he felt that in returning to camp he should reenter slavery nevertheless he did 	193.20245566947105
the cardinal was for him the fascinating serpent and himself the bird which flie	340.7014317198385
the return to la rochelle therefore was profoundly dull	620.3013108036741
our four friends in particular astonished their comrades they traveled together 	526.1294449608366
athos alone from time to time raised his expansive brow a flash kindled in his e	508.55316722197864

one day when the king had halted to fly the magpie and the four friends accordin	48.45302298866268
holloa monsieur dartagnan said he is not that you whom i see yonder	93.81789442075679
dartagnan raised his head and uttered a cry of joy	15.572406976843938
it was the man he called his phantom it was his stranger of meung of the rue des	90.18331265495527
dartagnan drew his sword and sprang toward the door	28.455723925873915
but this time instead of avoiding him the stranger jumped from his horse and adv	117.26566091877221
ah monsieur said the young man i meet you then at last this time you shall not e	40.180920830764464
neither is it my intention monsieur for this time i was seeking you in the name 	40.40761429977192
how what do you say cried dartagnan	17.426797364933407
i say that you must surrender your sword to me monsieur and that without resista	74.97965973112332
this concerns your head i warn you	345.96110351987215
who are you then demanded dartagnan lowering the point of his sword but without 	54.12308296219328
i am the chevalier de rochefort answered the other the equerry of monsieur le ca	62.51642875772077
we are returning to his eminence monsieur the chevalier said athos advancing and	67.48529828465148
i must place him in the hands of guards who will take him into camp	126.56004237448789
we will be his guards monsieur upon our word as gentlemen but likewise upon our 	357.38947066221556
the chevalier de rochefort cast a glance backward and saw that porthos and arami	83.33075652880959
gentlemen said he if monsieur dartagnan will surrender his sword to me and join 	69.72908102917565
you have my word monsieur and here is my sword	75.71770842427577
this suits me the better said rochefort as i wish to continue my journey	79.17323486134535
if it is for the purpose of rejoining milady said athos coolly it is useless you	22.034662827407423
what has become of her then asked rochefort eagerly	22.248315806234988
return to camp and you shall know	77.14431223499568
rochefort remained for a moment in thought then as they were only a days journey	120.01442709710922
besides this return offered him the advantage of watching his prisoner	345.3922701796443
they resumed their route	344.7783361745941
on the morrow at three oclock in the afternoon they arrived at surgres	18.120885401865806
the cardinal there awaited louis xiii	430.1063719084959
the minister and the king exchanged numerous caresses felicitating each other up	439.80412623323963
after which the cardinal who had been informed that dartagnan was arrested and w	47.728835644010985
on returning in the evening to his quarters at the bridge of la pierre the cardi	66.92022407524955
this time as he was well attended he looked at them sternly and made a sign with	71.4677017983421
dartagnan obeyed	492.9985388904031
we shall wait for you dartagnan said athos loud enough for the cardinal to hear 	45.065399956633655
his eminence bent his brow stopped for an instant and then kept on his way witho	85.71528873822551
dartagnan entered after the cardinal and behind dartagnan the door was guarded	79.72676615609114
his eminence entered the chamber which served him as a study and made a sign to 	69.98630630469813
rochefort obeyed and retired	149.23343542879536
dartagnan remained alone in front of the cardinal this was his second interview 	93.3455138700985
richelieu remained standing leaning against the mantelpiece a table was between 	212.84226623471656
monsieur said the cardinal you have been arrested by my orders	24.912399421732598
so they tell me monseigneur	206.1461997714935
do you know why	14.826256380616755
no monseigneur for the only thing for which i could be arrested is still unknown	169.7492191524861
richelieu looked steadfastly at the young man	34.599705715556716
holloa said he what does that mean	49.23666806677433
if monseigneur will have the goodness to tell me in the first place what crimes 	135.0929987457471
crimes are imputed to you which had brought down far loftier heads than yours mo	620.584439456817
what monseigneur said dartagnan with a calmness which astonished the cardinal hi	125.47548551732532
you are charged with having corresponded with the enemies of the kingdom you are	112.57438643000623
and who charges me with this monseigneur said dartagnan who had no doubt the acc	92.37606783595314
what do you say monsieur cried the cardinal astonished and of what woman are you	46.23576282765559
of milady de winter replied dartagnan yes of milady de winter of whose crimes yo	92.19604171940512
monsieur said the cardinal if milady de winter has committed the crimes you lay 	101.3010069643741
she has been punished monseigneur	402.6297121270481
and who has punished her	133.9413860246718
she is in prison	48.732625034454905
she is dead	18.34530640838302
dead repeated the cardinal who could not believe what he heard dead did you not 	78.17770232376957
three times she attempted to kill me and i pardoned her but she murdered the wom	170.5673298936
then my friends and i took her tried her and condemned her	166.07510225267882
dartagnan then related the poisoning of mme	336.7234693376959
bonacieux in the convent of the carmelites at bthune the trial in the isolated h	53.5080405880743
a shudder crept through the body of the cardinal who did not shudder readily	165.92771446101892
but all at once as if undergoing the influence of an unspoken thought the counte	269.16447095366726
so said the cardinal in a tone that contrasted strongly with the severity of his	56.75628414847252
monseigneur i swear to you that i never for an instant had the intention of defe	36.77073316268486
i willingly submit to any punishment your eminence may please to inflict upon me	656.4374252459813
i do not hold life dear enough to be afraid of death	281.31119647989686
yes i know you are a man of a stout heart monsieur said the cardinal with a voic	23.24483871254277
another might reply to your eminence that he had his pardon in his pocket	122.74530563875763
i content myself with saying command monseigneur i am ready	576.7299837946761
your pardon said richelieu surprised	55.63736983998739
yes monseigneur said dartagnan	66.78913850711005
and signed by whomby the king and the cardinal pronounced these words with a sin	112.52055861362115
no by your eminence	168.1551372976007
by me you are insane monsieur	1448.510040148556
monseigneur will doubtless recognize his own handwriting	1710.3278646603474
and dartagnan presented to the cardinal the precious piece of paper which athos 	83.74966130833627
his eminence took the paper and read in a slow voice dwelling upon every syllabl	107.92772725864278
3 1627	11.31535680482942
it is by my order and for the good of the state that the bearer of this has done	89.67764715001951
the cardinal after having read these two lines sank into a profound reverie but 	227.53851634409986
he is meditating by what sort of punishment he shall cause me to die said the ga	122.36481088045424
well my faith he shall see how a gentleman can die	123.732255682887
the young musketeer was in excellent disposition to die heroically	1489.0035647801606
richelieu still continued thinking rolling and unrolling the paper in his hands	294.0817876055093
at length he raised his head fixed his eagle look upon that loyal open and intel	203.98054778750983
on the other side the crimes the power and the infernal genius of milady had mor	91.96293999102365
he felt something like a secret joy at being forever relieved of this dangerous 	525.2157886279334
richelieu slowly tore the paper which dartagnan had generously relinquished	842.1367093732591
i am lost said dartagnan to himself	30.81285657044996
and he bowed profoundly before the cardinal like a man who says lord thy will be	195.31271414261963
the cardinal approached the table and without sitting down wrote a few lines upo	211.50749699460513
that is my condemnation thought dartagnan he will spare me the ennui of the bast	102.98162471011635
that s very kind of him	49.95067480220109
here monsieur said the cardinal to the young man	12.016267632657739
i have taken from you one carte blanche to give you another	90.97058330275506
the name is wanting in this commission you can write it yourself	323.817001779691
dartagnan took the paper hesitatingly and cast his eyes over it it was a lieuten	59.6643462510979
dartagnan fell at the feet of the cardinal	31.883445204229517
monseigneur said he my life is yours henceforth dispose of it	273.4989020528198
but this favor which you bestow upon me i do not merit	266.9156415292705
i have three friends who are more meritorious and more worthy	453.7816687832075
you are a brave youth dartagnan interrupted the cardinal tapping him familiarly 	593.1537860364394
do with this commission what you will only remember though the name be blank it 	391.8477438778491
i shall never forget it replied dartagnan	22.76182696744955
your eminence may be certain of that	28.281763763402594
the cardinal turned and said in a loud voice rochefort the chevalier who no doub	59.68935919855101
rochefort said the cardinal you see monsieur dartagnan	24.996949931800078
i receive him among the number of my friends	115.95646699232879
greet each other then and be wise if you wish to preserve your heads	184.89446696459578
rochefort and dartagnan coolly greeted each other with their lips but the cardin	109.80511401608004
they left the chamber at the same time	26.993153185894556
we shall meet again shall we not monsieur	106.24752191451168
when you please said dartagnan	20.307942736524527
an opportunity will come replied rochefort	58.94607028631685
hey said the cardinal opening the door	20.819903210221902
the two men smiled at each other shook hands and saluted his eminence	77.34741312679813
we were beginning to grow impatient said athos	233.32340136456423
here i am my friends replied dartagnan not only free but in favor	76.97532212022533
tell us about it	33.87978640708627
this evening but for the moment let us separate	91.79632443547357
accordingly that same evening dartagnan repaired to the quarters of athos whom h	150.81841519392592
dartagnan related what had taken place between the cardinal and himself and draw	169.74646712179563
athos smiled with one of his sweet and expressive smiles	96.99929334656548
friend said he for athos this is too much for the comte de la fre it is too litt	20.906827472733543
keep the commission it is yours	135.4312260883158
alas you have purchased it dearly enough	455.945852419581
dartagnan left athoss chamber and went to that of porthos	103.1907313704904
he found him clothed in a magnificent dress covered with splendid embroidery adm	315.42292464213875
ah ah is that you dear friend exclaimed porthos	44.230723571178665
how do you think these garments fit me	297.3197045917741
