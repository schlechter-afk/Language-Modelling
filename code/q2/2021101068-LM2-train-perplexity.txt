still youngfor he was scarcely fortysix years of agehe possessed great elegance 	233.21706365589174
after a short time the cardinal arranged his shoulder belt then looked with grea	108.16998223214293
at this instant the door opened	5.836182076096051
monsieur dartagnan said the valetdechambre	21.064723988155773
an officer as he spoke entered the apartment	36.08495386472028
he was a man between thirtynine and forty years of age of medium height but a ve	41.48435159330544
dartagnan advanced a few steps into the apartment	34.277524262402494
how perfectly he remembered his former entrance into that very room seeing howev	384.7703767500282
the lieutenant remained standing in a dignified but respectful posture such as b	234.1346500819897
the cardinal looked at him with a cunning rather than serious glance yet he exam	48.09572346981313
you are monsieur dartagnan	28.383710882717992
i am that individual replied the officer	74.73689682962733
mazarin gazed once more at a countenance full of intelligence the play of which 	196.44774387946245
sir resumed the cardinal you are to come with me or rather i am to go with you	23.650780584288118
i am at your command my lord returned dartagnan	21.036156891303925
i wish to visit in person the outposts which surround the palais royal do you su	79.94432781526648
danger my lord exclaimed dartagnan with a look of astonishment what danger	34.663200349999144
i am told that there is a general insurrection	65.53752697833703
the uniform of the kings musketeers carries a certain respect with it and even i	84.884282622621
did you witness the injury sustained by comminges	115.9739959927604
monsieur de comminges is in the guards and not in the musketeers	27.25219471861298
which means i suppose that the musketeers are better soldiers than the guards	124.7005591464387
the cardinal smiled as he spoke	32.73406225463048
every one likes his own uniform best my lord	260.5144447980473
myself excepted and again mazarin smiled for you perceive that i have left off m	135.2555570571055
lord bless us this is modesty indeed cried dartagnan	200.21451411600515
had i such a uniform as your eminence possesses i protest i should be mightily c	103.58384032210598
yes but for tonights adventure i do nt suppose my dress would have been a very s	79.25735487033295
give me my felt hat bernouin	251.0346297147991
the valet instantly brought to his master a regimental hat with a wide brim	96.11969101807672
the cardinal put it on in military style	142.19625154600013
your horses are ready saddled in their stables are they not he said turning to d	84.25379385096299
yes my lord	5.599011637407858
well let us set out	20.02305950076293
how many men does your eminence wish to escort you	36.034195575860934
you say that with four men you will undertake to disperse a hundred low fellows 	102.93429791980263
as many as my lord wishes	84.24375061469149
i will follow you	21.250375161336688

chapter ii	2.258838644724402
a nightly patrol	447.16181539478055
in ten minutes mazarin and his party were traversing the street les bons enfants	36.57141798386113
the appearance of the town denoted the greatest agitation	124.46418471616104
numberless groups paraded the streets and whatever dartagnan might think of it i	168.60604635836373
from time to time noises came in the direction of the public markets	43.23887970604295
the report of firearms was heard near the rue saint denis and occasionally churc	57.377437201443605
dartagnan meantime pursued his way with the indifference of a man upon whom such	76.8885644476369
when he approached a group in the middle of the street he urged his horse upon i	46.37559706391612
the cardinal envied that composure which he attributed to the habit of meeting d	123.53476300318191
on approaching an outpost near the barriere des sergens the sentinel cried out w	111.8273471522023
after which he inquired if lieutenant comminges were not the commanding officer 	314.2882068009654
the soldier replied by pointing out to him an officer who was conversing on foot	119.9761481136463
here was the officer dartagnan was seeking	51.95788531562132
here is monsieur comminges said dartagnan returning to the cardinal	16.064947103955472
he instantly retired from a feeling of respectful delicacy it was however eviden	94.82064607715196
well done guitant cried the cardinal to the equestrian i see plainly that notwit	61.073537243368314
what were you saying to this youngster	35.43760627946069
my lord replied guitant i was observing that we live in troublous times and that	37.948581980660975
are you aware that the mob have even suggested throwing up barricades in the rue	68.91092915075139
and what was comminges saying to you in reply my good guitant	65.79155518295985
my lord said comminges i answered that to compose a ligue only one ingredient wa	64.7160742224359
no but they mean to make a fronde as they call it said guitant	66.94725734590003
and what is a fronde inquired mazarin	31.86016238960975
my lord fronde is the name the discontented give to their party	190.03886852759558
and what is the origin of this name	25.56903686621683
it seems that some days since councillor bachaumont remarked at the palace that 	85.9759586905121
so they have picked up the word and the insurrectionists are called frondeurs an	78.97592105112216
at that moment a window opened and a man began to sing	37.301928180086186
a tempest from the fronde did blow today i think twill blow sieur mazarin away	548.1947524085701
insolent wretch cried guitant	35.68994218093134
my lord said comminges who irritated by his wounds wished for revenge and longed	65.17859881358112
and as he spoke he put his hand on the holster of his uncles saddlebow	18.43865387025489
certainly not certainly not exclaimed mazarin	148.50115093067654
diavolo my dear friend you are going to spoil everythingeverything is going on f	40.15407740314583
i know the french as well as if i had made them myself	30.007269433178806
they singlet them pay the piper	251.13687658590203
during the ligue about which guitant was speaking just now the people chanted no	145.4234081816277
come guitant come along and lets see if they keep watch at the quinzevingts as a	110.33221815585
and waving his hand to comminges he rejoined dartagnan who instantly put himself	76.83212365339838
just so muttered comminges looking after mazarin	167.2874822912251
true i forgot provided he can get money out of the people that is all he wants	83.63444842713103
the street of saint honore when the cardinal and his party passed through it was	62.528204878416894
they pitied the young king who was unconsciously ruining his country and threw a	106.18704778832209
addresses to the duke of orleans and to cond were suggested	42.497832208877696
blancmesnil and broussel seemed in the highest favor	57.400478689109164
dartagnan passed through the very midst of this discontented mob just as if his 	127.44426581721824
mazarin and guitant conversed together in whispers	120.38847439294362
the musketeers who had already discovered who mazarin was followed in profound s	123.11776618603899
in the street of saint thomasdulouvre they stopped at the barrier distinguished 	48.0369112545022
here guitant spoke to one of the subalterns asking how matters were progressing	114.98991589461237
ah captain said the officer everything is quiet hereaboutif i did not know that 	50.84098554026068
and he pointed to a magnificent hotel situated on the very spot whereon the vaud	72.62054005866135
in that hotel it is the hotel rambouillet cried guitant	54.95648712728959
i really do nt know what hotel it is all i do know is that i observed some suspi	84.15598354164801
nonsense exclaimed guitant with a burst of laughter those men must be poets	54.84930729969074
come guitant speak if you please respectfully of these gentlemen said mazarin do	85.18145003970066
you my lord	25.815218044795557
yes i shall i repeat to you some of my verses	33.06088490557122
just as you please my lord	22.86750422181111
i do not understand italian	12.998498872795995
yes but you understand french and mazarin laid his hand upon guitants shoulder	53.590925179529
my good my brave guitant whatsoever command i may give you in that languagein fr	98.56242817088471
i have already answered that question in the affirmative but that command must c	162.61235074478924
yes ah yes mazarin bit his lips as he spoke i know your devotion to her majesty	54.516411111266876
i have been a captain in the queens guards for twenty years was the reply	54.19897262309043
en route monsieur dartagnan said the cardinal all goes well in this direction	51.532310812410635
dartagnan in the meantime had taken the head of his detachment without a word an	43.91546855149332
he led the way toward the hill of saint roche	32.54599543953117
the rue richelieu and the rue villedot were then owing to their vicinity to the 	45.3877520718173
who is in command here asked the cardinal	37.55133975698633
villequier said guitant	10.604543984568101
diavolo speak to him yourself for ever since you were deputed by me to arrest th	93.97773744688621
he laid claim to that honor as captain of the royal guards	277.6269761991272
i am aware of that and i have told him a hundred times that he was wrong	25.745584087383214
the king could not give that order since at that time he was hardly four years o	74.7020516469793
yes but i could give him the orderi guitantand i preferred to give it to you	28.41908478100807
guitant without reply rode forward and desired the sentinel to call monsieur de 	457.19027410861054
ah so you are here cried the officer in the tone of illhumor habitual to him wha	37.234061648120374
i wish to knowcan you tell me prayis anything fresh occurring in this part of th	71.77547766456148
what do you mean people cry out long live the king down with mazarin that s noth	72.78736213888851
and you sing chorus replied guitant laughing	139.99056820198226
faith i ve half a mind to do it	108.82106143129442
in my opinion the people are right and cheerfully would i give up five years of 	97.743521084048
really and pray what would come to pass supposing the king were five years older	123.64089821381339
as soon as ever the king comes of age he will issue his commands himself and tis	138.38258989095542
than the son of peter mazarin	9.814182142319586
sdeath i would die willingly for the king but supposing i happened to be killed 	87.83730342126694
well well monsieur de villequier mazarin interposed i shall make it my care the 	49.70105324618662
come gentlemen addressing the troop let us return	148.1605170698009
stop exclaimed villequier so mazarin was here so much the better	64.88800183096471
i have been waiting for a long time to tell him what i think of him	28.205671563944538
i am obliged to you guitant although your intention was perhaps not very favorab	73.75760518257324
he turned away and went off to his post whistling a tune then popular among the 	66.69814841811986
all that he had heard from these three different men comminges guitant and ville	44.22764441389283
during the whole of this nocturnal ride during the whole time that he was endeav	41.623875583907186
this man who had remained immovable as bronze when menaced by the mobnot a muscl	52.36926651765382
the name of dartagnan was not altogether new to mazarin who although he did not 	31.180960040665504
the three musketeers	86.41994568858084
possessed by this idea the cardinal resolved to know all about dartagnan immedia	72.55965464179442
now the italians and the gascons are too much alike and know each other too well	57.07865653990453
they both dismounted consigned their horses to the lackey who had opened the doo	45.798066615885865
my dear friend said the cardinal leaning as they walked through the garden on hi	35.36055938452894
yes its true	600.2756312148686
i have returned guitant	43.806012933803544
now my dear guitant i have often remarked that in addition to your courage which	50.90307304885191
you have found that out have you my lord deuce take itall the worse for me	161.50930845159306
there is no doubt but that one of the chief accomplishments of a courtier is to 	31.774306133396017
but you guitant are not a courtier	61.20463998467862
you are a brave soldier one of the few remaining veterans of the days of henry i	39.24009099497277
alas how few today exist	1781.9067904841236
plague ont my lord have you brought me here to get my horoscope out of me	68.7312591618824
no i only brought you here to ask you returned mazarin smiling if you have taken	61.587685556968786
monsieur dartagnan i have had no occasion to notice him particularly he s an old	50.21603463022235
he s a gascon	39.61749225433992
de trville knows him and esteems him very highly and de trville as you know is o	81.68455453496242
as a soldier the man ranks well he did his whole duty and even more at the siege	146.03658242048976
but you know guitant we poor ministers often want men with other qualities besid	225.37616768349034
pray was not monsieur dartagnan in the time of the cardinal mixed up in some int	49.115823390360944
my lord as to the report you allude toguitant perceived that the cardinal wished	102.53920453721052
i never meddle in intrigues and if i occasionally become a confidant of the intr	132.67945617047843
mazarin shook his head	10.745260249151666
ah he said some ministers are fortunate and find out all that they wish to know	111.25144902015727
my lord replied guitant such ministers do not weigh men in the same balance they	72.08072933939542
consult some politician of the period of which you speak and if you pay well for	86.42921804027534
eh pardieu said mazarin with a grimace which he always made when spoken to about	90.45601758290483
they will be paid if there is no way of getting out of it	34.74082327362807
does my lord seriously wish me to name any one who was mixed up in the cabals of	71.79906271167047
by bacchus rejoined mazarin impatiently its about an hour since i asked you for 	125.67901725180056
there is one man for whom i can answer if he will speak out	49.131728314521155
that s my concern i will make him speak	59.634054504463855
ah my lord tis not easy to make people say what they do nt wish to let out	68.21502394715351
pooh with patience one must succeed	386.936476518543
well this man	81.79836842587814
who is he	28.104022188236133
the comte de rochefort	8.752840538330009
the comte de rochefort	9.502393937662909
unfortunately he has disappeared these four or five years and i do nt know where	36.393333924593364
i know guitant said mazarin	14.858359290704138
well then how is it that your eminence complained just now of want of informatio	75.36351879338187
you think resumed mazarin that rochefort	79.01886358701184
he was cardinal richelieus creature my lord	285.2897485272227
i warn you however his services will cost you something	168.9744281491239
the cardinal was lavish to his underlings	74.43707714385918
yes yes guitant said mazarin richelieu was a great man a very great man but he h	27.088394957207306
thanks guitant i shall benefit by your advice this very evening	121.90455370697069
here they separated and bidding adieu to guitant in the court of the palais roya	42.159682629841264
it was dartagnan who was waiting for him	12.09149955203344
come hither said mazarin in his softest voice i have an order to give you	21.295037489840343
dartagnan bent low and following the cardinal up the secret staircase soon found	254.36219899448253
the cardinal seated himself before his bureau and taking a sheet of paper wrote 	122.22607948049634
he was like a soldierly automaton or rather like a magnificent marionette	68.29205990667883
the cardinal folded and sealed his letter	177.7997405076927
monsieur dartagnan he said you are to take this dispatch to the bastile and brin	19.0256968129617
you must take a carriage and an escort and guard the prisoner with the greatest 	70.0804788478932
dartagnan took the letter touched his hat with his hand turned round upon his he	38.2013336068785
five minutes afterward the wheels of the carriage and the horses shoes were hear	34.396753958567
chapter iii	2.5370171156901895
dead animosities	22.216549166234234
dartagnan arrived at the bastile just as it was striking halfpast eight	78.79664369784473
his visit was announced to the governor who on hearing that he came from the car	38.65800711429337
the governor of the bastile was monsieur du tremblay the brother of the famous c	35.30086206946768
during the period that the duc de bassompierre passed in the bastilewhere he rem	26.109072214530446
his prediction was nearly fulfilled but in a very different way from that which 	98.73652218642546
monsieur du tremblay received dartagnan with extreme politeness and invited him 	37.75090989958557
i should be delighted to do so was the reply but if i am not mistaken the words 	26.92754417348922
you are right said du tremblay	16.63191440789705
halloo major tell them to order number 25 to come downstairs	833.61082668693
the unhappy wretch who entered the bastile ceased as he crossed the threshold to	107.36080213571583
dartagnan shuddered at the noise of the keys he remained on horseback feeling no	78.05377663276732
a bell resounded	2141.888360767249
i must leave you said du tremblay i am sent for to sign the release of a prisone	40.40062067479325
i shall be happy to meet you again sir	31.29469340976702
may the devil annihilate me if i return thy wish murmured dartagnan smiling as h	79.03182627097304
go to go to i would rather die on straw than hoard up a thousand a year by being	146.2377590377624
he had scarcely finished this soliloquy before the prisoner arrived	84.9075999891661
on seeing him dartagnan could hardly suppress an exclamation of surprise	74.83546334833638
the prisoner got into the carriage without seeming to recognize the musketeer	60.684891996250364
gentlemen thus dartagnan addressed the four musketeers i am ordered to exercise 	152.34211814646818
monsieur de lillebonne lead my horse by the bridle if you please	30.49103014081655
as he spoke he dismounted gave the bridle of his horse to the musketeer and plac	25.328723738656947
the carriage drove on and dartagnan availing himself of the darkness in the arch	65.67802438051629
rochefort he exclaimed you is it you indeed i am not mistaken	42.991330860496745
dartagnan cried rochefort	18.763717001584503
ah my poor friend resumed dartagnan not having seen you for four or five years i	50.09492408408531
ifaith said rochefort there s no great difference i think between a dead man and	60.664986735253905
and for what crime are you imprisoned in the bastile	58.45999567491674
do you wish me to speak the truth	19.662762634909072
well then i do nt know	7.615284359345592

no on the honor of a gentleman but i can not be imprisoned for the reason allege	20.869954226138073
what reason asked dartagnan	76.75650669858275
for stealing	304.40222445275043
for stealing you rochefort you are laughing at me	60.828327395732
i understand	107.31105346706651
you mean that this demands explanation do you not	69.14713131331378
i admit it	97.11152142382655

four or five cloaks had already been lifted with a dexterity without parallel an	56.99853088880741
duc dharcourt fontrailles and the others escaped de rieux was inclined to do lik	56.85629061383293
he would nt listen put his foot on the spur to get down the spur broke he fell w	96.8127962895233
i then was ready to dismount but it was too late i descended into the arms of th	41.063468626337645
they conducted me to the chatelet where i slept soundly being very sure that on 	133.2433432499883
the next day came and passed the day after a week i then wrote to the cardinal	55.71016258233673
the same day they came for me and took me to the bastile	33.58707502813358
that was five years ago	55.65976563701945
do you believe it was because i committed the sacrilege of mounting en croupe be	86.74287841828342
no you are right my dear rochefort it could nt be for that but you will probably	37.26520733058483
ah indeed i forgot to ask youwhere are you taking me	76.33114913035061
to the cardinal	17.166894126693528
what does he want with me	19.033423325000946
i do not know	5.1116051607728945
i did not even know that you were the person i was sent to fetch	37.2579314571058
impossibleyoua favorite of the minister	144.64179840076764
a favorite no indeed cried dartagnan	158.40847215961324
ah my poor friend i am just as poor a gascon as when i saw you at meung twentytw	29.538556534502217
nevertheless you come as one in authority	246.41488969311976
because i happened to be in the antechamber when the cardinal called me by the m	50.13184328416719
i am still a lieutenant in the musketeers and have been so these twenty years	74.71434180420786
then no misfortune has happened to you	53.73881905278935
and what misfortune could happen to me to quote some latin verses i have forgott	60.37703549960492
then mazarin is still mazarin	41.60827812791646
the same as ever my friend it is said that he is married to the queen	74.64319380597573
if not her husband he is unquestionably her lover	153.69729719630075
you surprise me	290.0692717097179
rebuff buckingham and consent to mazarin	49.70520079830675
just like the women replied dartagnan coolly	152.48289144320574
like women not like queens	2927.7259590071535
egad queens are the weakest of their sex when it comes to such things as these	119.42358332949757
and m	225.4884994475692
de beaufortis he still in prison	53.64809471845039
oh nothing but that he might get me out of this if he were favorably inclined to	69.75734876172416
you are probably nearer freedom than he is so it will be your business to get hi	137.95625283181988
and said the prisoner what talk is there of war with spain	90.97440066043501
with spain no answered dartagnan but paris	52.4513375342908
what do you mean cried rochefort	6.793791549417911
do you hear the guns pray the citizens are amusing themselves in the meantime	85.8601805170852
and youdo you really think that anything could be done with these bourgeois	104.09919653159064
yes they might do well if they had any leader to unite them in one body	93.84071248283554
how miserable not to be free	212.55047652920393
do nt be downcast	30.266300381807135
since mazarin has sent for you it is because he wants you	57.71684919963935
i congratulate you many a long year has passed since any one has wanted to emplo	116.3132634229069
make your complaints known that s my advice	199.2279818088572
listen rochefort let us make a compact	33.692333760038395
we are friends are we not	24.71871817948109
egad i bear the traces of our friendshipthree slits or slashes from your sword	122.16489876450707
well if you should be restored to favor do nt forget me	89.90431321745832
on the honor of a rochefort but you must do the like for me	36.79883280423393
there s my handi promise	132.8745234961167
therefore whenever you find any opportunity of saying something in my behalf	148.34863188921315
i shall say it and you	28.63158690812491
i shall do the same	21.15702311155664
apropos are we to speak of your friends also athos porthos and aramis or have yo	44.72694918602413
what has become of them	16.904792156094977
i do nt know we separated as you know	43.0433191746422
they are alive that s all that i can say about them from time to time i hear of 	57.55223039343146
and the illustriouswhats the name of the lad whom i made a sergeant in piedmonts	73.3770971035852
the illustrious planchet	421.1996851598815
what has become of him	15.088678185340843
i should nt wonder if he were at the head of the mob at this very moment	42.15149132962068
he married a woman who keeps a confectioners shop in the rue des lombards for he	35.57024947908399
you ll see that that queer fellow will be a sheriff before i shall be a captain	86.47679054071108
come dear dartagnan look up a little courage it is when one is lowest on the whe	74.87626165419162
this evening your destiny begins to change	217.6315379896843
amen exclaimed dartagnan stopping the carriage	85.1752763759882
what are you doing asked rochefort	4.669469311001663
we are almost there and i want no one to see me getting out of your carriage we 	63.64509244609936
you are right	5.657312852728619
au revoir	1.6040416744567527
remember your promise	112.34438967858162
in five minutes the party entered the courtyard and dartagnan led the prisoner u	30.254086077254573
as they stopped at the door of the cardinals study dartagnan was about to be ann	16.391828860084097
dartagnan let me confess to you what i ve been thinking about during the whole o	59.9979147123355
speak out answered dartagnan	99.06276803051661
i had only to cry out help for you and for your companions to be cut to pieces a	94.58334390578662
why did nt you do it asked the lieutenant	19.05003028344621
come come cried rochefort	10.348581436733138
did we not swear friendship ah had any one but you been there i do nt say	125.68566948306969
dartagnan bowed	56.5473874400724
is it possible that rochefort has become a better man than i am he said to himse	23.875805623643217
and he caused himself to be announced to the minister	60.015798149011324
let m	27962.612221600877
de rochefort enter said mazarin eagerly on hearing their names pronounced and be	95.2809077814377
dartagnan to wait i shall have further need of him	142.8932891030494
these words gave great joy to dartagnan	101.35874679419776
as he had said it had been a long time since any one had needed him and that dem	28.251241660487874
rochefort rendered suspicious and cautious by these words entered the apartment 	184.466747224818
as the door was closed rochefort cast a glance toward mazarin which was answered	54.74854941079809
there was little change in the cardinal still dressed with sedulous care his hai	171.38913836623297
but rochefort who had passed five years in prison had become old in the lapse of	45.466653622478695
as he gazed at him mazarin shook his head slightly as much as to say this is a m	33.73507165726681
after a pause which appeared an age to rochefort mazarin took from a bundle of p	42.40671929964547
i find here a letter in which you sue for liberty monsieur de rochefort	84.63019119321827
you are in prison then	46.16409975966406
rochefort trembled in every limb at this question	108.4924726159387
but i thought he said that your eminence knew that circumstance better than any 	94.4836784671951
i oh no there is a congestion of prisoners in the bastile who were cooped up in 	56.65259044556774
yes but in regard to myself my lord it can not be so for i was removed from the 	46.75858535554192
you think you were	78.65118210245446
i am certain of it	14.003920151686234
ah stay i fancy i remember it	236.91398518596404
did you not once refuse to undertake a journey to brussels for the queen	43.62108307679319
ah ah exclaimed rochefort	8.482033172392127
there is the true reason idiot that i am though i have been trying to find it ou	37.86438763821304
but i do not say it was the cause of your imprisonment	19.70842951167685
i merely ask you did you not refuse to go to brussels for the queen whilst you h	42.02740979445412
that is the very reason i refused to go back to brussels	30.50179836101145
i was there at a fearful moment	77.65640006849367
i was sent there to intercept a correspondence between chalais and the archduke 	69.99444956384039
how could i then return to brussels i should injure the queen instead of serving	80.87908836459391
well since the best motives are liable to misconstruction the queen saw in your 	78.79510321302934
rochefort smiled contemptuously	430.214263146629
since i was a faithful servant my lord to cardinal richelieu during his life it 	58.458657647115416
with regard to myself monsieur de rochefort replied mazarin i am not like monsie	28.007119186336375
i am but a minister who wants no servants being myself nothing but a servant of 	174.4773858589151
now the queen is of a sensitive nature	62.50653256920562
hearing of your refusal to obey her she looked upon it as a declaration of war a	95.02527909738897
but your release can be managed	307.6443172705055
you are one of those men who can comprehend certain matters and having understoo	46.15225841472925
such was cardinal richelieus opinion my lord	262.4624270814614
the cardinal interrupted mazarin was a great politician and therein shone his va	117.21624103927333
i am a straightforward simple man that s my great disadvantage	77.82914919718046
i am of a frankness of character quite french	78.45090467789203
rochefort bit his lips in order to prevent a smile	29.536479058061236
now to the point	43.65452173313922
i want friends i want faithful servants	1781.523626290071
when i say i want i mean the queen wants them	103.93566742040102
i do nothing without her commandspray understand that not like monsieur de riche	125.36556362830203
so i shall never be a great man as he was but to compensate for that i shall be 	38.89866607985496
rochefort knew well the tones of that soft voice in which sounded sometimes a so	160.30952470215377
i am disposed to believe your eminence he replied though i have had but little e	101.33878780183153
do not forget that i have been five years in the bastile and that no medium of v	19.567896791216338
ah monsieur de rochefort have i not told you already that i had nothing to do wi	26.711240945666532
i can easily suppose sir that her majesty has forgotten it amid the fetes and th	61.880820502179816
ah mon dieu my dear monsieur de rochefort do you absolutely think that the palai	25.41797158815487
we have had great annoyances there	196.76424057899942
as for me i play my game squarely fairly and above board as i always do	123.49324127719888
let us come to some conclusion	32.462408239405704
are you one of us monsieur de rochefort	18.780397588622385
i am very desirous of being so my lord but i am totally in the dark about everyt	68.88264310757285
in the bastile one talks politics only with soldiers and jailers and you have no	150.66172015325287
is he still one of the seventeen peers of france	22.78711380829379
he is dead sir a great loss	81.58431924034574
his devotion to the queen was boundless men of loyalty are scarce	221.32832573704604
i think so forsooth said rochefort and when you find any of them you march them 	60.630515167533595
however there are plenty in the world but you do nt look in the right direction 	62.090586947102686
indeed explain to me	170.75026414870828
ah my dear monsieur de rochefort how much you must have learned during your inti	33.022921773981714
will your eminence be angry if i read you a lesson	48.49953094887727
i never you know you may say anything to me	65.15641177214128
i try to be beloved not feared	427.4170517890004
well there is on the wall of my cell scratched with a nail a proverb which says 	66.9455335293367
pray what does that mean	52.700207773835345
it means that monsieur de richelieu was able to find trusty servants dozens and 	86.34020334639993
he the point aimed at by every poniard richelieu who passed his life in warding 	326.038022358897
but he did ward them off said de rochefort and the reason was that though he had	92.99183662926738
i have known persons he continuedfor he thought he might avail himself of the op	111.49260472867799
but those men you speak of said mazarin smiling inwardly on seeing rochefort app	79.26120983496993
no in that case they would have met with more fitting reward	94.59101136154992
they had the misfortune to be devoted to that very queen for whom just now you w	121.06615451053379
but how is it that you know so much of these matters	35.86246379103758
i know them because the men of whom i speak were at that time my enemies because	87.1172676882098
ah said mazarin with admirable suavity could i but find such men	114.44912767697652
my lord there has stood for six years at your very door a man such as i describe	121.55813524348095
who is it	17.056496580363344
it is monsieur dartagnan	15.023053256551076
that gascon cried mazarin with well acted surprise	163.06091462196537
that gascon has saved a queen and made monsieur de richelieu confess that in poi	52.59201120437687
it is as i have the honor of telling it to your excellency	17.560722298539893
tell me a little about it my dear monsieur de rochefort	13.30129050665608
that is somewhat difficult my lord said rochefort with a smile	16.49687811472693
then he will tell it me himself	141.43792166822573
i doubt it my lord	36.81576082716836
why do you doubt it	17.319550776569073
because the secret does not belong to him because as i have told you it has to d	35.012205380124165
and he was alone in achieving an enterprise like that	71.2004483173595
no my lord he had three colleagues three brave men men such as you were wishing 	90.69100780112475
and were these four men attached to each other true in heart really united	193.31681800578087
as if they had been one manas if their four hearts had pulsated in one breast	89.9908659431392
you pique my curiosity dear rochefort pray tell me the whole story	106.82603881435102
that is impossible but i will tell you a true story my lord	25.295875659946333
pray do so i delight in stories cried the cardinal	185.23960024948084
listen then returned rochefort as he spoke endeavoring to read in that subtle co	59.89829432422409
once upon a time there lived a queena powerful monarchwho reigned over one of th	160.94233038190845
do not try my lord you can not guess who it is all this happened long before you	68.95701328010614
there came to the court an ambassador so brave so magnificent so elegant that ev	112.91609184354478
as these ornaments were given by the king the minister persuaded his majesty to 	90.96438043815468
there is no occasion to tell you my lord that the minister knew for a fact that 	32.40486089778807
this illustrious queen had fallen low as the least of her subjectsfallen from he	175.96283837521932
well my lord four men resolved to save her	102.34239769595563
these four men were not princes neither were they dukes neither were they men in	157.33184525843203
they were four honest soldiers each with a good heart a good arm and a sword at 	204.46950298133135
they set out	23.13313184972434
the minister knew of their departure and had planted people on the road to preve	73.58298033238131
three of them were overwhelmed and disabled by numerous assailants one of them a	60.229437062629025
he crossed the sea and brought back the set of ornaments to the great queen who 	122.99729943175474
what do you think of that exploit my lord	17.139738728017132
it is magnificent said mazarin thoughtfully	25.50143492468451
well i know of ten such men	196.99725084903412
mazarin made no reply he reflected	51.62788815217241
five or six minutes elapsed	15.00850397268526
you have nothing more to ask of me my lord said rochefort	16.459810436113568
and you say that monsieur dartagnan was one of those four men	18.011879342303757
he led the enterprise	199.45183083365603
and who were the others	88.62927859458796
i leave it to monsieur dartagnan to name them my lord	59.77358100404089
they were his friends and not mine	85.4986132405655
he alone would have any influence with them i do not even know them under their 	126.02389824996727
you suspect me monsieur de rochefort i want him and you and all to aid me	56.820189971855186
begin with me my lord for after five or six years of imprisonment it is natural 	42.04311424859516
you my dear monsieur de rochefort shall have the post of confidence you shall go	39.8957007729482
well what is the matter	7.0923259178338345
the matter is that you have proposed to me what is impossible said rochefort sha	25.398865164828567
what impossible and why is it impossible	129.76864015754484
because monsieur de beaufort is one of my friends or rather i am one of his	17.965277145163267
have you forgotten my lord that it is he who answered for me to the queen	25.393312822052692
since then monsieur de beaufort has become an enemy of the state	38.35570493425885
that may be my lord but since i am neither king nor queen nor minister he is not	72.38099739817568
this then is what you call devotion i congratulate you	185.09665058242788
your devotion does not commit you too far monsieur de rochefort	51.9400005192804
and then my lord continued rochefort you understand that to emerge from the bast	31.03998679551547
say at once that you are on the side of monsieur de beaufort that will be the mo	15.521010971617578
my lord i have been so long shut up that i am only of one partyi am for fresh ai	57.77318574385556
employ me in any other way employ me even actively but let it be on the high roa	46.1927692694596
my dear monsieur de rochefort mazarin replied in a tone of raillery you think yo	13.684804262925846
believe me you ought now to take a rest	93.49010718161244
you decide then nothing about me my lord	99.05521042941325
on the contrary i have come to a decision	28.748986768965082
bernouin came into the room	22.439818283243905
call an officer of justice he said and stay close to me he added in a low tone	43.33378483263626
the officer entered	202.11810317657822
mazarin wrote a few words which he gave to this man then he bowed	51.50864062661457
adieu monsieur de rochefort he said	12.473814071668786
rochefort bent low	160.3121237355206
i see my lord i am to be taken back to the bastile	23.7296914074134
you are sagacious	66.91814995417697
i shall return thither my lord but it is a mistake on your part not to employ me	50.530356863760545
you the friend of my greatest foes do nt suppose that you are the only person wh	91.26968916374521
i shall find many men as able as you are	81.95183891265604
i wish you may my lord replied de rochefort	38.231164537852955
he was then reconducted by the little staircase instead of passing through the a	68.5130717278293
in the courtyard the carriage and the four musketeers were ready but he looked a	43.40274094174557

when left alone with bernouin mazarin was for some minutes lost in thought	151.4215534451027
he had gained much information but not enough	319.23965704141744
mazarin was a cheat at the cardtable	50.279145045792816
this is a detail preserved to us by brienne	83.65335368956927
he called it using his advantages	291.86488977074083
he now determined not to begin the game with dartagnan till he knew completely a	128.830627081524
my lord have you any commands asked bernouin	36.671827586550044
yes yes replied mazarin	6.881779277729196
light me i am going to the queen	38.29457557073834
bernouin took up a candlestick and led the way	38.63057847420939
there was a secret communication between the cardinals apartments and those of t	54.88263785795059
this secret passage is still to be seen in the palais royal	49.51177271950907
in the bedroom in which this passage ended bernouin encountered madame de beauva	80.98154634755441
to receive the cardinal	43.7306917626908
anne reclining in a large easychair her head supported by her hand her elbow res	86.05360016161094
this celebrated woman fully understood the art of being dull with dignity	302.98350345530827
it was her practice to pass hours either in her oratory or in her room without e	199.41559872214413
when madame de beauvais appeared at the door and announced the cardinal the chil	17.565135742842067
why he said does he enter without first asking for an audience	157.1384832906018
anne colored slightly	2072.9071181492063
the prime minister she said is obliged in these unsettled days to inform the que	155.67054607666228
but richelieu never came in this manner said the pertinacious boy	148.33632396344316
how can you remember what monsieur de richelieu did you were too young to know a	39.41754513734161
i do not remember what he did but i have inquired and i have been told all about	49.95288995673473
and who told you about it asked anne of austria with a movement of impatience	25.862024807469208
i know that i ought never to name the persons who answer my questions answered t	110.38668346369116
at this very moment mazarin entered	17.516193590481443
the king rose immediately took his book closed it and went to lay it down on the	69.5738794831907
mazarin contemplated these proceedings with a thoughtful glance	237.4335354232041
they explained what had occurred that evening	270.2444953022009
he bowed respectfully to the king who gave him a somewhat cavalier reception but	49.94287490561209
had entertained toward mazarin and he endeavored to receive the ministers homage	91.56938549298256
anne of austria sought to read in mazarins face the occasion of this unexpected 	78.30832171686318
the minister made a slight sign with his head whereupon the queen said to madame	62.4196505460153
it is time for the king to go to bed call laporte	31.94186378638077
the queen had several times already told her son that he ought to go to bed and 	64.09898466985588
in a few minutes laporte came into the room	9.167043238138318
the child went directly to him without kissing his mother	97.47268654668864
well louis said anne why do you not kiss me	31.587565851154356
i thought you were angry with me madame you sent me away	46.982024087704815
i do not send you away but you have had the smallpox and i am afraid that sittin	32.96980416623054
you had no fears of my being tired when you ordered me to go to the palace today	47.088546644182614
sire interposed laporte in order to turn the subject to whom does your majesty w	26.17138911923033
to any one laporte the child said and then added in a loud voice to any one exce	68.59953727795298
now mancini was a nephew of mazarins and was as much hated by louis as the cardi	43.04804010393446
and the king went out of the room without either embracing his mother or even bo	46.18351909565635
good said mazarin i am glad to see that his majesty has been brought up with a h	12.506842232912323
why do you say that asked the queen almost timidly	20.930073495833785
why it seems to me that the way in which he left us needs no explanation	43.759800997057475
besides his majesty takes no pains to conceal how little affection he has for me	86.08745950332583
that however does not hinder me from being entirely devoted to his service as i 	100.83810708954944
i ask your pardon for him cardinal said the queen he is a child not yet able to 	44.67181968506896
the cardinal smiled	90.7791403405644
but continued the queen you have doubtless come for some important purpose	66.06442722404793
what is it then	8.659548263121408
mazarin sank into a chair with the deepest melancholy painted on his countenance	47.702772462999626
it is likely he replied that we shall soon be obliged to separate unless you lov	49.62207886193265
why cried the queen how is that	29.614177373245713
because as they say in the opera of thisbe the whole world conspires to break ou	46.28582541826222
you jest sir answered the queen endeavoring to assume something of her former di	105.34170465801846
alas i do not madame rejoined mazarin	36.44958596799113
mark well what i say	139.08328117582903
the whole world conspires to break our bonds	202.25924898277617
now as you are one of the whole world i mean to say that you also are deserting 	48.13473826015874
heavens did i not see you the other day smile on the duke of orleans or rather a	48.25686214304181
and what was he saying	43.34422098431388
he said this madame mazarin is a stumblingblock	36.80922212466195
send him away and all will then be well	43.71589947393667
what do you wish me to do	9.733063224926028
oh madame you are the queen	33.17910211070939
queen forsooth when i am at the mercy of every scribbler in the palais royal who	51.49857150505365
nevertheless you have still the power of banishing from your presence those whom	75.21180563532099
that is to say whom you do not like returned the queen	38.56076348800699
i persons whom i do not like	174.4248962591256
yes indeed	98.5354078940933
who sent away madame de chevreuse after she had been persecuted twelve years und	49.02382124419795
a woman of intrigue who wanted to keep up against me the spirit of cabal she had	89.93917305415773
de richelieu	1.045394183849402
who dismissed madame de hautefort that friend so loyal that she refused the favo	93.69705128967037
a prude who told you every night as she undressed you that it was a sin to love 	93.05504539923018
who ordered monsieur de beaufort to be arrested	36.6494953981306
an incendiary the burden of whose song was his intention to assassinate me	102.36650806062546
you see cardinal replied the queen that your enemies are mine	71.11745253402579
that is not enough madame it is necessary that your friends should be also mine	61.59200270092556
my friends monsieur the queen shook her head	43.91348971625513
alas i have them no longer	42.24480542099098
how is it that you have no friends in your prosperity when you had many in adver	30.33949452912277
it is because in my prosperity i forgot those old friends monsieur because i hav	83.04653960813806
well let us see said mazarin is nt there still time to repair the evil search am	111.8463319061814
what do you mean monsieur	10.881913804144105
nothing else than i saysearch	357.31091725323466
alas i look around me in vain i have no influence with any one	62.001503937986094
monsieur is as usual led by his favorite yesterday it was choisy today it is la 	139.06842627203352
monsieur le prince is led by the coadjutor who is led by madame de guemenee	36.521891017672935
therefore madame i ask you to look not among your friends of today but among tho	128.32830287388222
among my friends of other times said the queen	38.99314525824592
yes among your friends of other times among those who aided you to contend again	200.4354573976965
what is he aiming at murmured the queen looking uneasily at the cardinal	64.1931933484045
yes continued his eminence under certain circumstances with that strong and shre	134.39100490745753
i said the queen	29.302069025609583
i suffered that is all	182.51231075753046
yes said mazarin as women suffer in avenging themselves	241.38345677479887
come let us come to the point	20.27978305541807
do you know monsieur de rochefort	7.4862050502802955
one of my bitterest enemiesthe faithful friend of cardinal richelieu	53.54589215430343
i know that and we sent him to the bastile said mazarin	29.51697199480168
is he at liberty asked the queen	29.10915536368011
no still there but i only speak of him in order that i may introduce the name of	50.1341501432704
do you know monsieur dartagnan he added looking steadfastly at the queen	35.63776823823729
anne of austria received the blow with a beating heart	80.15048158658487
has the gascon been indiscreet she murmured to herself then said aloud	138.55274023197168
dartagnan stop an instant the name seems certainly familiar	612.7005047790459
dartagnan there was a musketeer who was in love with one of my women	57.67912950140943
poor young creature she was poisoned on my account	78.16596062509053
that s all you know of him asked mazarin	19.097948250098135
the queen looked at him surprised	26.39908885223253
you seem sir she remarked to be making me undergo a course of crossexamination	201.84544277215534
which you answer according to your fancy replied mazarin	109.63685600776797
tell me your wishes and i will comply with them	36.196737564154475
the queen spoke with some impatience	133.65989559883292
well madame said mazarin bowing i desire that you give me a share in your friend	42.379550848532006
the circumstances are grave and it will be necessary to act promptly	68.50261826029067
still said the queen	12.291664931323478
i thought that we were finally quit of monsieur de beaufort	75.03652869631368
yes you saw only the torrent that threatened to overturn everything and you gave	262.2366252008862
there is however a proverb current in france relating to water which is quiet	205.36748173115615
continue said the queen	12.983789653456013
well then madame not a day passes in which i do not suffer affronts from your pr	92.79251172415518
we have arrested monsieur de beaufort but he is the least dangerous among them	56.661830007532984
there is the prince de cond	13.188427528273937
the hero of rocroy	76.92655703535006
do you think of him	8.849895196623235
yes madame often and often but pazienza as we say in italy next after monsieur d	239.43237251927047
what are you saying the first prince of the blood the kings uncle	69.20079744452386
no not the first prince of the blood not the kings uncle but the base conspirato	117.87769433656004
but he is mistaken i shall not leave so near the queen that source of discord wi	66.67102498993042
anne blushed and buried her face in her hands	62.39152989393095
what am i to do she said bowed down beneath the voice of her tyrant	76.9082918465647
endeavor to remember the names of those faithful servants who crossed the channe	45.36328092813405
anne arose full of majesty and as if touched by a spring and looking at the card	99.19937651360618
i wish continued mazarin finishing as it were the speech this sudden movement of	192.4079399826046
again that accusation cried the queen	127.87079450072551
i thought that calumny was stifled or extinct you have spared me till now but si	176.67958960707605
madame i do not ask you to tell me said mazarin astounded by this returning cour	26.553959168732504
i will tell you all replied anne	13.87864137426647
listen there were in truth at that epoch four devoted hearts four loyal spirits 	195.70454195894052
ah you confess it exclaimed mazarin	46.862523103600594
is it only the guilty whose honor is at the sport of others sir and can not wome	87.32313726839492
however i swear i was not guilty i swear it by	53.4482167523309
the queen looked around her for some sacred object by which she could swear and 	94.29815103506618
i swear she said by these sacred relics that buckingham was not my lover	117.0786572427393
what relics are those by which you swear asked mazarin smiling	108.83590296202753
i am incredulous	125.20695091514223
the queen untied from around her throat a small golden key which hung there and 	200.24172483509594
open sir she said and look for yourself	108.924527209049
mazarin opened the coffer a knife covered with rust and two letters one of which	104.23310762021002
what are these things he asked	32.487045122030786
what are these things replied anne with queenlike dignity extending toward the o	53.94519820721366
these two letters are the only ones i ever wrote to him	93.24586333327555
this knife is the knife with which felton stabbed him	171.07209492137227
read the letters and see if i have lied or spoken the truth	118.1172167917064
but mazarin notwithstanding this permission instead of reading the letters took 	287.3365187276281
the blade was red for the blood had become rust after a momentary examination du	249.03379631258863
it is well madame i believe your oath	55.787466242889494
no no read exclaimed the queen indignantly read i command you for i am resolved 	149.47521944393048
do you think she said with a ghastly smile that i shall be inclined to reopen th	23.1089816354385
mazarin overcome by this determination read the two letters	350.32906218770734
in one the queen asked for the ornaments back again	161.65462150730497
this letter had been conveyed by dartagnan and had arrived in time	38.07746694059329
the other was that which laporte had placed in the hands of the duke of buckingh	27.225866864877812
it is well madame said mazarin nothing can gainsay such testimony	111.54248354273412
sir replied the queen closing the coffer and leaning her hand upon it if there i	35.86668787695064
as she spoke she extended her beautiful hand to the cardinal and showed him a su	29.163637988817936
it appears she resumed that he sold ithe sold it in order to save me another tim	93.74384108131069
i bought it from him but it belongs to dartagnan	56.58291004331933
give it back to him sir and since you have such a man in your service make him u	39.33695627156896
thank you madame said mazarin	7.122533648676806
i will profit by the advice	111.57211297100817
and now added the queen her voice broken by her emotion have you any other quest	69.58323557812042
nothingthe cardinal spoke in his most conciliatory mannerexcept to beg of you to	73.29456968137565
i love you so tenderly that i can not help being jealous even of the past	86.32040274273248
a smile which was indefinable passed over the lips of the queen	53.20470556768852
since you have no further interrogations to make leave me i beseech you she said	47.90142028173674
i wish after such a scene to be alone	189.21332820260608
mazarin bent low before her	179.49637797219708
i will retire madame	103.41722496816341
do you permit me to return	12.939974662876121
yes tomorrow	4409.210299324951
the cardinal took the queens hand and pressed it with an air of gallantry to his	22.17505545589861
scarcely had he left her when the queen went into her sons room and inquired fro	77.48492111224829
laporte pointed to the child who was asleep	77.40039398901884
anne ascended the steps side of the bed and softly kissed the placid forehead of	68.22650710630177

the gascon and the italian	30.661570979280693
meanwhile the cardinal returned to his own room and after asking bernouin who st	43.38792510667805
when he was alone he opened the door of the corridor and then that of the antech	16.404711163538995
there dartagnan was asleep upon a bench	87.85326270927078
the cardinal went up to him and touched his shoulder	23.056105882165788
dartagnan started awakened himself and as he awoke stood up exactly like a soldi	140.35035957277043
here i am said he	19.80225334073615
who calls me	124.33202502931535

i ask pardon of your eminence said dartagnan but i was so fatigued	29.50936555157124
do nt ask my pardon monsieur said mazarin for you fatigued yourself in my servic	43.24496241568532
dartagnan admired mazarins gracious manner	1295.6664459079466
ah said he between his teeth is there truth in the proverb that fortune comes wh	139.12964663592444

well continued mazarin the time has come to put to use your talents and your val	53.82973531313332
there was a sudden gleam of joy in the officers eyes which vanished immediately 	63.169167502632035
order my lord he said i am ready to obey your eminence	14.501495685268948
monsieur dartagnan continued the cardinal you performed sundry superb exploits i	155.65659155599909
your eminence is too good to remember such trifles in my favor	52.0174424430065
it is true i fought with tolerable success	77.43804867699708
i do nt speak of your warlike exploits monsieur said mazarin although they gaine	61.58530685185254
dartagnan pretended astonishment	2508.5108102809672
well you do not reply resumed mazarin	34.82487984459296
i am waiting my lord till you tell me of what exploits you speak	43.19325575266896

i speak of that adventure in behalf of the queen of the ornaments of the journey	39.62448257516809
aha thought the gascon is this a snare or not let me be on my guard	68.96460927094921
and he assumed a look of stupidity which mendori or bellerose two of the first a	44.90005716188369
bravo cried mazarin they told me that you were the man i wanted	27.53359235321716
come let us see what you will do for me	22.009318899507708
everything that your eminence may please to command me was the reply	71.00969586085763
you will do for me what you have done for the queen	20.395146095325874
certainly dartagnan said to himself he wishes to make me speak out	58.80468984677954
he s not more cunning than de richelieu was devil take him then he said aloud	126.62173360381438

the queen said dartagnan with an astonishment which this time was not pretended	57.08491684479711
yes the queen and as a proof of what i say she commanded me to show you this dia	50.49379426488418

answer me without acting as if you were on the stage your interests are concerne	64.71150724730735
faith my lord it is very necessary for me to make my fortune your eminence has s	33.08237911907891
we need only a week to amend all that	75.69608460744956
come you are accounted for you are here but where are your friends	63.099986421174194
i do not know my lord	8.9165119644966
we have parted company this long time all three have left the service	279.1258751842023
where can you find them then	28.51999692775136
wherever they are that s my business	111.70269316667631
well now what are your conditions if i employ you	54.06261015643103
money my lord as much money as what you wish me to undertake will require	112.19278188543264
i remember too well how sometimes we were stopped for want of money and but for 	152.34291721477342
the devil he does money and a large sum said mazarin	83.90251187248501
pray are you aware that the king has no money in his treasury	25.788692065658374
do then as i did my lord	69.69324736840541
sell the crown diamonds	265.83459660419777
trust me do nt let us try to do things cheaply	33.335480640265715
great undertakings come poorly off with paltry means	1395.5083043344102
well returned mazarin we will satisfy you	47.5446175371752
richelieu thought dartagnan would have given me five hundred pistoles in advance	44.219863115685975
you will then be at my service asked mazarin	24.206505698143914
yes if my friends agree	156.88123643495865
but if they refuse can i count on you	219.89010927056492
i have never accomplished anything alone said dartagnan shaking his head	46.78660896402294
go then and find them	45.19056338643228
what shall i say to them by way of inducement to serve your eminence	48.632272674742296
you know them better than i	78.16126443941772
adapt your promises to their respective characters	267.1206334326852
what shall i promise	47.90059800641805
that if they serve me as well as they served the queen my gratitude shall be mag	58.47245752946626
but what are we to do	11.041631824523092
make your mind easy when the time for action comes you shall be put in full poss	80.20503827060375
my lord perhaps they are not in paris	32.56058670096273
it is even probable that i shall have to make a journey	31.982693889951285
i am only a lieutenant of musketeers very poor and journeys cost money	163.7259710902921
my intention said mazarin is not that you go with a great following my plans req	90.1160384489409
still my lord i ca nt travel on my pay for it is now three months behind and i c	53.576003636878696
mazarin remained some moments in deep thought as if he were fighting with himsel	69.33288038600261
take this he said with a sigh tis merely for your journey	76.48143669016476
if these are spanish doubloons or even gold crowns thought dartagnan we shall ye	206.92816658912307
he saluted the cardinal and plunged the bag into the depths of an immense pocket	62.99037935458503
well then all is settled you are to set off said the cardinal	47.094081774177575
yes my lord	5.893028805420182
apropos what are the names of your friends	31.397977760604842
the count de la fere formerly styled athos monsieur du vallon whom we used to ca	51.879888859948345
the cardinal smiled	87.22421763400862
younger sons he said who enlisted in the musketeers under feigned names in order	258.1589591018469
long swords but light purses	695.4127791961072
was that it	74.06482331793033
if god willing these swords should be devoted to the service of your eminence sa	99.65741485892143
these gascons said the cardinal laughing almost beat the italians in effrontery	129.30969630740555
at all events answered dartagnan with a smile almost as crafty as the cardinals 	33.04786586178519
he then withdrew and as he passed into the courtyard he stopped near a lamp and 	47.69174170815525
crown pieces onlysilver pieces i suspected it	456.22552989667855
ah mazarin mazarin thou hast no confidence in me so much the worse for thee for 	74.24193690072602
meanwhile the cardinal was rubbing his hands in great satisfaction	93.14369869280502

he returned to his room and after depositing the ring in a casket filled with br	44.44968061375933
in the meantime dartagnan took his way toward the rue tiquetonne where he lived 	17.920021677868487
we will explain in a few words how dartagnan had been led to choose that place o	90.55281618773758
chapter vi	2.3522212411623338
dartagnan in his fortieth year	84.39005814893699
years have elapsed many events have happened alas since in our romance of the th	102.52619942423335
12 rue des fossoyeurs	10.95782373617811
dartagnan had not failed in his career but circumstances had been adverse to him	59.49482532531055
so long as he was surrounded by his friends he retained his youth and the poetry	49.98008719627764
he was one of those fine ingenuous natures which assimilate themselves easily to	70.45662367327023
athos imparted to him his greatness of soul porthos his enthusiasm aramis his el	159.66672050503882
had dartagnan continued his intimacy with these three men he would have become a	72.70515130720605
athos was the first to leave him in order that he might retire to a little prope	25.26816630963864
from that day dartagnan felt lonely and powerless without courage to pursue a ca	205.89048836823494
notwithstanding his commission in the musketeers dartagnan felt completely solit	188.96690676155654
for a time the delightful remembrance of madame bonancieux left on his character	101.84885053218926
a garrison life is fatal even to the most aristocratic organization and impercep	166.5556129886019
his early refinement of character was not only not lost it grew even greater tha	177.69015178542213
these important advantages dartagnan found to his own taste in the rue tiquetonn	48.87104968603195
from the time dartagnan took quarters in that hotel the mistress of the house a 	69.31060119360733
he was thought to be dead his wife especially who cherished the pleasing idea th	127.84055519788544
therefore after the connection had continued three years carefully fostered by d	326.37960679882264
ah fie dartagnan replied	202.1243678060881
bigamy my dear come now you do nt really wish it	120.43297203041912
but he is dead i am sure of it	12.150849581200221
he was a very contrary fellow and might come back on purpose to have us hanged	126.99360297765759
all right if he comes back you will kill him you are so skillful and so brave	61.690351000901046
peste my darling another way of getting hanged	617.8809227721235
so you refuse my request	170.80001905955027
to be sure i dofuriously	54.94178792286009
the pretty landlady was desolate	689.4166164278964
she would have taken dartagnan not only as her husband but as her god he was so 	67.44900957129356
then along toward the fourth year came the expedition of franchecomte	146.59018813293417
dartagnan was assigned to it and made his preparations to depart	86.19059703181183
there were then great griefs tears without end and solemn promises to remain fai	366.1507659692596
dartagnan was too grand to promise anything he purposed only to do all that he c	114.98541980240618
as to that we know dartagnans courage he exposed himself freely to danger and wh	122.20445879457002
he had been seen falling from his horse and had not been seen to rise every one 	61.105987916430536
one believes readily what he wishes to believe	229.20144902410135
now in the army from the divisiongenerals who desire the death of the generalinc	49.59902593947183
but dartagnan was not a man to let himself be killed like that	34.14664047235665
after he had remained through the heat of the day unconscious on the battlefield	38.07203845899637
he gained a village knocked at the door of the finest house and was received as 	65.81377020826369
he was petted tended cured and one fine morning in better health than ever befor	348.5069593042242
once in france he turned his course toward paris and reaching paris went straigh	59.366649055723485
but dartagnan found in his chamber the personal equipment of a man complete exce	72.42954028117865
he has returned said he	64.23796033217023
so much the worse and so much the better	10.361159938354755
it need not be said that dartagnan was still thinking of the husband	46.39415409273003
he made inquiries and discovered that the servants were new and that the mistres	100.18022231157498
alone asked dartagnan	23.5386830024089
with monsieur	749.4638339011163
monsieur has returned then	453.425214680927
of course naively replied the servant	73.77871042166862
if i had any money said dartagnan to himself i would go away but i have none	32.029921511606425
i must stay and follow the advice of my hostess while thwarting the conjugal des	199.1049007447855
he had just completed this monologuewhich proves that in momentous circumstances	184.7350460576715
ah see here is madame returning with monsieur	500.20059726435557
dartagnan looked out and at the corner of rue montmartre saw the hostess coming 	32.23429809837464
is that monsieur said dartagnan to himself	27.439650584757846
oh oh he has grown a good deal it seems to me	18.916934309214085
and he sat down in the hall choosing a conspicuous place	73.54772624558144
the hostess as she entered saw dartagnan and uttered a little cry whereupon dart	77.41198377519723
the swiss with an air of stupefaction looked at the hostess who turned pale	30.94587686059646
ah it is you monsieur what do you want of me she asked in great distress	43.07245351416152
is monsieur your cousin is monsieur your brother said dartagnan not in the sligh	76.80164820466854
and without waiting for her reply he threw himself into the arms of the helvetia	36.52686333711761
who is that man he asked	33.78665102714569
the hostess replied only by gasps	607.3164488761133
who is that swiss asked dartagnan	9.244473973521249
monsieur is going to marry me replied the hostess between two gasps	76.72609782915086
your husband then is at last dead	149.18434307275524
how does that concern you replied the swiss	26.244020517867355
it concerns me much said dartagnan since you can not marry madame without my con	65.45713694875897
and since asked the swiss	61.59135657849282
and sincei do not give it said the musketeer	30.259496413122797
the swiss became as purple as a peony	39.69480382255373
he wore his elegant uniform dartagnan was wrapped in a sort of gray cloak the sw	58.11219540325818
will you go away from here demanded the swiss stamping violently like a man who 	46.06261159513453
i by no means said dartagnan	44.074926296826604
some one must go for help said a lad who could not comprehend that this little m	70.09966281758489
dartagnan with a sudden accession of wrath seized the lad by the ear and led him	83.57763871209715
stay you where you are and do nt you stir or i will pull this ear off	184.20727020080173
as for you illustrious descendant of william tell you will straightway get toget	130.53702391470242
the swiss began to laugh boisterously	50.67603852874177
i go out he said	58.62760237641813
and why	65.99336551525333
ah very well said dartagnan i see that you understand french	17.670346970738144
come then and take a turn with me and i will explain	47.546170528799536
the hostess who knew dartagnans skill with the sword began to weep and tear her 	141.34622911766414
dartagnan turned toward her saying then send him away madame	143.94028103671874
pooh said the swiss who had needed a little time to take in dartagnans proposal 	45.2282243697743
i am lieutenant in his majestys musketeers said dartagnan and consequently your 	91.40553146514216
dartagnan led away the swiss in spite of lamentations on the part of the hostess	34.1871343367516
it was night when the two adversaries reached the field of battle	57.56257735025731
dartagnan politely begged the swiss to yield to him the disputed chamber the swi	62.34564160187215
then you will lie here said dartagnan	40.39055621839994
it is a wretched bed but that is not my fault and it is you who have chosen it	42.069445145658676
with these words he drew in his turn and crossed swords with his adversary	37.895843735662304
he had to contend against a strong wrist but his agility was superior to all for	141.30289811748187
the swiss received two wounds and was not aware of it by reason of the cold but 	97.65356295449403
there said dartagnan what did i tell you fortunately you wo nt be laid up more t	56.82563612240303
remain here and i will send you your clothes by the boy	65.13286572701217
goodby oh by the way you d better take lodging in the rue montorgueil at the cha	68.97858676473949
you will be well fed there if the hostess remains the same	49.63092910857252
thereupon he returned in a lively mood to his room and sent to the swiss the thi	23.286413147763817
the boy found him sitting where dartagnan had left him still overwhelmed by the 	97.8976811161887
the boy the hostess and all the house had the same regard for dartagnan that one	151.47188759505025
but when he was alone with the hostess he said now pretty madeleine you know the	63.68993274008519
as for you you have acted like a barmaid	66.61932073062779
so much the worse for you for by such conduct you have lost my esteem and my pat	57.32298990024499
i have driven away the swiss to humiliate you but i shall lodge here no longer	66.57029120116745
i will not sleep where i must scorn	90.2039133269308
ho there boy have my valise carried to the muid damour rue des bourdonnais	109.27354569283447
adieu madame	40.5339000530534
in saying these words dartagnan appeared at the same time majestic and grieved	34.97130954244752
the hostess threw herself at his feet asked his pardon and held him back with a 	74.11067879135285
what more need be said the spit turned the stove roared the pretty madeleine wep	168.15184984240616
he pardoned and having pardoned he remained	255.85417142817695
and this explains how dartagnan had quarters in the rue tiquetonne at the hotel 	54.654439425837296
dartagnan then returned home in thoughtful mood finding a somewhat lively pleasu	236.2633856638333
should that diamond ever fall into my hands again he reflected i would turn it a	211.44850526207557
then i should like to have three sons i should make the first a nobleman like at	132.6582003310367
faith that would be a far better life than i lead now but monsieur mazarin is a 	112.91754560278851
on entering the rue tiquetonne he heard a tremendous noise and found a dense cro	39.027520969176365
oho said he is the hotel on fire on approaching the hotel of the roe he found ho	55.72304793992225
the people were shouting and running about with torches	100.944667988628
by the light of one of these torches dartagnan perceived men in uniform	57.536397936335504
he asked what was going on	87.16925066989177
he was told that twenty citizens headed by one man had attacked a carriage which	196.75101176903235
in his youth dartagnan had often headed the bourgeoisie against the military but	158.51735556429298
there he found madeleine alarmed for his safety and anxious to tell him all the 	67.88272227104702
he took his key and candle and went upstairs to his bedroom	48.02755515289313
he had been contented for the convenience of the house to lodge in the fourth st	29.4764995617659
his first care on entering it was to lock up in an old bureau with a new lock hi	100.53108237966018
not to reflect on what had passed as one might fancy	358.0190321108161
no dartagnan considered that things are never well done when they are not reserv	103.24176975476226
he was hungry he supped he went to bed	108.74869905491757
neither was he one of those who think that the necessary silence of the night br	43.65033789792546
in the night he slept but in the morning refreshed and calm he was inspired with	73.59301592705089
it was long since he had any reason for his mornings inspiration but he always s	88.91996557634803
at daybreak he awoke and took a turn around his room	51.459504768230325
in 43 he said just before the death of the late cardinal i received a letter fro	104.49342445064629
where was i then let me see	59.762551645366834
oh at the siege of besancon i was in the trenches	31.42602483040147
he told melet me thinkwhat was it that he was living on a small estatebut where 	126.85234560031297
let me see with regard to porthos i received a letter from him too	63.827321505649685
he invited me to a hunting party on his property in the month of september 1646	61.80350129748838
unluckily as i was then in bearn on account of my fathers death the letter follo	42.114504576037795
i had left bearn when it arrived and i never received it until the month of apri	55.62285984135814
let me look for this letter it must be with my title deeds	62.84343394067223
dartagnan opened an old casket which stood in a corner of the room and which was	25.732936312161314
he uttered an exclamation of delight for the large handwriting of porthos was di	58.363568928355605
dartagnan eagerly searched for the heading of this letter it was dated from the 	99.98150682354779
porthos had forgotten that any other address was necessary in his pride he fanci	86.59245049535568
devil take the vain fellow said dartagnan	59.25736678444905
however i had better find him out first since he ca nt want money	163.85608843096674
athos must have become an idiot by this time from drinking	151.5068497027566
aramis must have worn himself to a shadow of his former self by constant genufle	85.85215639246051
he cast his eyes again on the letter	39.045865209523086
there was a postscript	25.99115977713968
i write by the same courier to our worthy friend aramis in his convent	113.49476212342769
in his convent what convent there are about two hundred in paris and three thous	80.76212474055717
ah if i were but learned in theology i should recollect what it was he used to d	58.36877335511927
well suppose i go back to the cardinal and ask him for a passport into all the c	57.67684675174995
but no i should lose myself in the cardinals opinion	122.54675866256498
great people only thank you for doing the impossible what s possible they say th	292.3151799240724
but let us wait a little and reflect	82.0530735070791
i received a letter from him the dear fellow in which he even asked me for some 	76.4685276861296
yes yes but now what did i do with that letter	45.813399612419204
dartagnan thought a moment and then went to the wardrobe in which hung his old c	49.004083865899474
he looked for his doublet of the year 1648 and as he had orderly habits he found	123.55714929812324
he felt in the pocket and drew from it a paper it was the letter of aramis	41.021577760406764
monsieur dartagnan you know that i have had a quarrel with a certain gentleman w	22.379513225544365
as i am of the church and the affair might injure me if i should share it with a	45.034316305029414
you will enter by the rue neuve sainte catherine under the second lamp on the ri	28.491024544774906
i shall be with mine under the third	109.18973979581115
wholly yours	1859.5352946784164
dartagnan tried to recall his remembrances	103.65029470930901
he had gone to the rendezvous had encountered there the adversary indicated whos	140.2236622324777
it is over aramis had said	93.50691518533426
i think i have killed the insolent fellow	67.47738259245136
but dear friend if you ever need me you know that i am entirely devoted to you	43.09842206184685
thereupon aramis had given him a clasp of the hand and had disappeared under the	26.247737475936702
so then he no more knew where aramis was than where athos and porthos were and t	91.22643975961194
he thought directly of his bag and rushed from the inner room where he was sleep	111.63581361857072
he was not mistaken as he entered his bedroom a man was getting in by the window	34.03646472132655
ah you scoundrel cried dartagnan taking the man for a thief and seizing his swor	33.369140651314154
sir cried the man in the name of heaven put your sword back into the sheath and 	34.977780281519905
i m no thief but an honest citizen well off in the world with a house of my own	120.23793603935749
my name isah but surely you are monsieur dartagnan	160.63350511145626
and thouplanchet cried the lieutenant	47.41872219405719
at your service sir said planchet overwhelmed with joy if i were still capable o	40.4284193001592
perhaps so replied dartagnan	28.91942849857889
but why the devil dost thou run about the tops of houses at seven oclock of the 	43.49641903461403
sir said planchet you must know but perhaps you ought not to know	36.4352238009917
tell us what returned dartagnan but first put a napkin against the window and dr	72.44104204733914
sir said the prudent planchet in the first place are you on good terms with mons	34.89748955515286
perfectly one of my dearest friends	62.77442999403543
ah so much the better	16.042980721804437
but what has de rochefort to do with this manner you have of invading my room	68.15861214554701
ah sir i must first tell you that monsieur de rochefort is	26.105057470537105
planchet hesitated	333.23546250511805
egad i know where he is said dartagnan	25.050639182945805
he s in the bastile	49.180763796079084
that is to say he was there replied planchet	19.84929475947424
but in returning thither last night when fortunately you did not accompany him a	166.62702678897813
the prisoner thought this a good opportunity for escape he called out his name a	111.89989054261977
i was there	51.784733934204695
i heard the name of rochefort	16.34981582645831
i remembered him well	381.02223854566756
i said in a loud voice that he was a prisoner a friend of the duc de beaufort wh	19.71528633474451
the people were infuriated they stopped the horses and cut the escort to pieces 	90.30091579639367
at this moment a patrol passed by	21.8695062930067
i was obliged to sound a retreat toward the rue tiquetonne i was pursued and too	77.05523298453973
this morning i ventured to run along the gutters and	74.36697331210374
well interrupted dartagnan i am delighted that de rochefort is free but as for t	46.17416068630572
nevertheless i promise thee thou shalt be hidden here though i risk by concealin	157.34872603971877
ah sir you know well i would risk my life for you	48.57215584595863
thou mayst add that thou hast risked it planchet	185.60989223555927
i have not forgotten all i owe thee	87.31997276807226
sit down there and eat in security	96.60274774351413
i see thee cast expressive glances at the remains of my supper	273.60234025853487
yes sir for all i ve had since yesterday was a slice of bread and butter with pr	63.46147719795242
although i do nt despise sweet things in proper time and place i found the suppe	92.62262652344246
poor fellow said dartagnan	9.77734213980873
well come set to	260.8126262143146
ah sir you are going to save my life a second time cried planchet	33.264146109255535
and he seated himself at the table and ate as he did in the merry days of the ru	36.181974688723024
while he turned this over in his mind planchet did his best to make up for lost 	128.33301472153386
at last he uttered a sigh of satisfaction and paused as if he had partially appe	25.56305725862189
come said dartagnan who thought that it was now a convenient time to begin his i	42.817342788824234
no sir replied planchet	6.913341414368361
the devil thou dost not dost know where porthos is	90.57350126580609
nonot at all	170.91888690119634
and aramis	14.732874508239586
not in the least	13.846842681903672
the devil the devil the devil	53.39906394567604
but sir said planchet with a look of shrewdness i know where bazin is	19.10263417643058
where is he	10.873163648293891
at notre dame	37.79672331261445
what has he to do at notre dame	43.485697409769
he is beadle	188.58928804124602
bazin beadle at notre dame he must know where his master is	96.13610079030597
without a doubt he must	101.04406581790417
dartagnan thought for a moment then took his sword and put on his cloak to go ou	33.025189355921164
sir said planchet in a mournful tone do you abandon me thus to my fate think if 	34.38433195195738
true said dartagnan	3.883459608420519
lets see	986.3097856654242
canst thou speak any patois	298.41749043863865
i can do something better than that sir i can speak flemish	62.32658840524826
where the devil didst thou learn it	71.19189317447696
in artois where i fought for years	132.05125663156608
listen sir	52.13093206065455
goeden morgen mynheer eth teen begeeray le weeten the ge sond heets omstand	133.6464484003141
which means	3044.739468784185
goodday sir i am anxious to know the state of your health	31.23441997057462
he calls that a language but never mind that will do capitally	189.78069329661875
dartagnan opened the door and called out to a waiter to desire madeleine to come	45.562928731951466
when the landlady made her appearance she expressed much astonishment at seeing 	304.8810159631035
my dear landlady said dartagnan i beg to introduce to you your brother who is ar	41.10172732577795
my brother	35.68784048392593
wish your sister goodmorning master peter	267.7091072908916
wilkom suster said planchet	106.55691306264109
goeden day broder replied the astonished landlady	629.318080812672
this is the case said dartagnan this is your brother madeleine you do nt know hi	19.806960961651747
you must dress him up during my absence	264.17997446712945
when i return which will be in about an hour you must offer him to me as a serva	42.787422072496504
you understand	103.36126965694352
that is to say i guess your wishes and that is all that s necessary said madelei	39.622971049945015
you are a precious creature my pretty hostess and i am much obliged to you	45.28216196797195
the next moment dartagnan was on his way to notre dame	33.71757448077408
chapter vii	2.214626356839367
touches upon the strange effects a halfpistole may have	95.7088497564393
dartagnan as he crossed the pont neuf congratulated himself on having found plan	132.22118772960044
it was like having a spy in the enemys camp	106.83536098941018
in this frame of mind grateful for the accidental meeting with planchet pleased 	309.0679139428005
he ran up the steps entered the church and addressing a verger who was sweeping 	68.12478745947853
monsieur bazin the beadle said the verger	117.49463909555656
there he is attending mass in the chapel of the virgin	53.26104404701989
dartagnan nearly jumped for joy he had despaired of finding bazin but now he tho	121.3078752418693
he knelt down just opposite the chapel in order not to lose sight of his man and	74.38279057152081
bazin wore his dress it may be observed with equal dignity and saintly propriety	233.68025351991338
it was not difficult to understand that he had gained the crown of his ambition 	28.911004122548547
his person had undergone a change analogous to the change in his dress his figur	93.34716077718052
the striking points of his face were effaced he had still a nose but his cheeks 	147.84470237101405
the officiating priest was just finishing mass whilst dartagnan was looking at b	372.88671561187397
it was to this end that he performed from time to time some of those early masse	56.06660053706414
a sacerdotal officer	442.61887147950597
dartagnan knelt as well as the rest received his share of the benediction and ma	96.79751723162896
bazin looked down and started as if he had seen a serpent	30.534861123459077
monsieur dartagnan he cried vade retro satanas	39.34405655883366
so my dear bazin said the officer laughing this is the way you receive an old fr	25.224875948360324
sir replied bazin the true friends of a christian are those who aid him in worki	68.63670682252726
i do nt understand you bazin nor can i see how i can be a stumblingblock in the 	30.018317691182208
you forget sir that you very nearly ruined forever that of my master and that it	128.7196072806499
my dear bazin you ought to perceive said dartagnan from the place in which you f	26.62573509781148
age produces good sense and as i doubt not but that your master is on the road t	76.98684825695936
rather say to take him back with you into the world	79.9215350502819
fortunately i do nt know where he is	11.465906995768716
how cried dartagnan you do nt know where aramis is	20.95577340062398
formerly replied bazin aramis was his name of perdition	42.13300393948301
by aramis is meant simara which is the name of a demon	55.38492799749692
happily for him he has ceased to bear that name	79.19086735422833
and therefore said dartagnan resolved to be patient to the end it is not aramis 	43.65348094064219
come my dear bazin tell me where he is	17.182806531613366
did nt you hear me tell you monsieur dartagnan that i do nt know where he is	16.890401636841688
yes certainly but to that i answer that it is impossible	67.90480152195745
it is nevertheless the truth monsieurthe pure truth the truth of the good god	147.0321995740581
dartagnan saw clearly that he would get nothing out of this man who was evidentl	49.856217333203304
well bazin said dartagnan since you do not know where your master lives let us s	43.2770602944182
accept this halfpistole to drink to my health	172.73550155964145
i do not drinkbazin pushed away with dignity the officers handtis good only for 	220.95208783560338
incorruptible murmured dartagnan i am unlucky and whilst he was lost in thought 	77.42734106902333
dartagnan was still in deep thought when some one touched him on the shoulder	73.13620973500883
he turned and was about to utter an exclamation of surprise when the other made 	47.975265566290645
you here rochefort he said in a low voice	20.277104599620845
hush returned rochefort	29.623569420481143
did you know that i am at liberty	10.815845137713634
i knew it from the fountainheadfrom planchet	61.74977101125147
and what brought you here	172.53678272518573
i came to thank god for my happy deliverance said rochefort	94.40815423562708
and nothing more i suppose that is not all	85.52156922137848
to take my orders from the coadjutor and to see if we can not wake up mazarin a 	51.86583943165001
a bad plan you ll be shut up again in the bastile	60.55314123666191
oh as to that i shall take care i assure you	32.629245524303876
the air the fresh free air is so good besides and rochefort drew a deep breath a	245.56472130497426
stop cried dartagnan i too am going	55.27986478022756
and if i may without impertinence askwhere are you going	116.95417241909902
to seek my friends	117.60780967341688
what friends	8369.668974418224
those that you asked about yesterday	449.87410684951806
athos porthos and aramisyou are looking for them	23.580293873957597
on honor	1848.0368568155245
what then is there surprising in that	57.179721811551836
queer though	680.9617686444589
and in whose behalf are you looking for them	82.67962993826126
you are in no doubt on that score	30.81188686652137
that is true	6.8015562827779465
unfortunately i have no idea where they are	33.51334833197273
and you have no way to get news of them wait a week and i myself will give you s	64.07478193635215
a week is too long	116.35148335381491
i must find them within three days	133.6330025546854
three days are a short time and france is large	55.06490040575002
no matter you know the word must with that word great things are done	249.27437829595928
and when do you set out	37.70865812742236
i am now on my road	55.0519047291637
good luck to you	90.33623094246765
and to youa good journey	413.01414668778403
perhaps we shall meet on our road	34.08420581931814
that is not probable	23.840288498909626
who knows chance is so capricious	236.37269032690438
adieu till we meet again apropos should mazarin speak to you about me tell him t	83.92816081456333
and rochefort went away with one of those diabolical smiles which used formerly 	47.51117818208837
go demon do what thou wilt it matters little now to me	317.6077246216653
there s no second constance in the world	28.50186789986363
on his return to the cathedral dartagnan saw bazin who was conversing with the s	22.107021884211708
bazin was making with his spare little short arms ridiculous gestures	573.6958734092783
dartagnan perceived that he was enforcing prudence with respect to himself	136.0232170013767
dartagnan slipped out of the cathedral and placed himself in ambuscade at the co	32.81696402653943
in five minutes bazin made his appearance looking in every direction to see if h	43.08450105614373
calmed by appearances he ventured to walk on through the rue notre dame	81.27179367145321
then dartagnan rushed out of his hiding place and arrived in time to see bazin t	45.41845160907397
afraid of making any inquiries at this house dartagnan entered a small tavern at	55.22769761321117
this beverage required a good halfhour to prepare	443.73127170228815
and dartagnan had time therefore to watch bazin unsuspected	172.86643185127437
he perceived in the tavern a pert boy between twelve and fifteen years of age wh	94.56828142039562
he questioned him and as the boy had no interest in deceiving dartagnan learned 	107.18795817775239
whilst he was talking to this lad a horse was brought to the door of bazins hous	30.28731358962364
it was saddled and bridled	94.3064699015219
almost immediately bazin came downstairs	152.19762836935794
look said the boy there s our beadle who is going a journey	73.15493950440856
and where is he going asked dartagnan	15.228005300555251
forsooth i do nt know	6.916658527213409
half a pistole if you can find out said dartagnan	38.80999499390526
for me cried the boy his eyes sparkling with joy if i can find out where bazin i	30.919577837187173
you are not joking are you	49.77667596654604
no on the honor of an officer there is the halfpistole and he showed him the sed	41.63599443611443
i shall ask him	40.461831840626246
just the very way not to know	129.59395105313686
wait till he is set out and then marry come up ask and find out	143.85032726245888
the halfpistole is ready and he put it back again into his pocket	60.522167372272655
i understand said the child with that jeering smile which marks especially the g	61.57083103519769
well we must wait	49.09077011506873
they had not long to wait	35.489918715275024
five minutes afterward bazin set off on a full trot urging on his horse by the b	42.562373084168215
scarcely had he turned the corner of the rue de la juiverie when the boy rushed 	27.365693604096126
before ten minutes had elapsed the child returned	49.02985272113695
well said dartagnan	4.2884560623296
well answered the boy the thing is done	83.93520464169244
where is he gone	30.305906298103526
the halfpistole is for me	201.39281822813692
doubtless answer me	444.78750237148273
i want to see it	27.258692922770713
give it me that i may see it is not false	63.53465969232747
there it is	15.686017471750214
the child put the piece of money into his pocket	55.26065204887643
and now where is he gone inquired dartagnan	39.68882303860467
he is gone to noisy	66.74813146557982
how dost thou know	57.61755443497084
ah faith there was no great cunning necessary	324.2796294252438
i knew the horse he rode it belonged to the butcher who lets it out now and then	119.49746461929259
now i thought that the butcher would not let his horse out like that without kno	67.8539199692156
and he answered that monsieur bazin went to noisy	85.88446215533224
tis his custom	1297.8015422051626
he goes two or three times a week	56.97323283928877
dost thou know noisy well	93.19763335533527
i think so truly my nurse lives there	211.22750830684996
is there a convent at noisy	143.5180347213284
is nt there a great and grand onethe convent of jesuits	170.09081697414322
what is thy name	66.99186855003722
dartagnan wrote the childs name in his tablets	192.93409461055822
please sir said the boy do you think i can gain any more halfpistoles in any way	31.6039275550999
perhaps replied dartagnan	13.998005056984976
and having got out all he wanted he paid for the hypocras which he did not drink	70.13938430260922
chapter viii	2.126628919829552
dartagnan going to a distance to discover aramis	86.09608037185218
on entering the hotel dartagnan saw a man sitting in a corner by the fire	24.719537375886688
it was planchet but so completely transformed thanks to the old clothes that the	80.73798234020056
madeleine introduced him in presence of all the servants	80.76077688843274
planchet addressed the officer with a fine flemish phrase the officer replied in	151.59725402788968
the plan adopted by dartagnan was soon perfected	231.7288839648237
he resolved not to reach noisy in the day for fear of being recognized he had th	84.28594025371508
he began his day by breakfasting substantiallya bad beginning when one wants to 	442.10714293726835
a most active search was still prosecuted in the house near the hotel de la chev	43.9399234235011
at about a league and a half from the city dartagnan finding that in his impatie	67.60124396543188
the inn was full of disreputable looking people who seemed as if they were on th	42.72467901813505
a man wrapped in a cloak appeared at the door but seeing a stranger he beckoned 	51.35302286792869
dartagnan on his side went up to the landlady praised her winewhich was a horrib	49.14831802097654
at four oclock dartagnan recommenced his journey	68.17148358208277
he proceeded slowly and in deep reverie	208.22142693518185
planchet also was lost in thought but the subject of their reflections was not t	73.96187565098096
one word which their landlady had pronounced had given a particular turn to dart	193.92894274814915
that name was indeed one to inspire imagination and produce thought	265.3639742142389
madame de longueville was one of the highest ladies in the realm she was also on	25.039974501190727
she had formerly been suspected of an intimacy of too tender a nature with colig	164.25387513104428
she was now connected by bonds of a political nature with the prince de marsilla	72.94514064912416
dartagnan thought of all these matters	145.41162030101273
he remembered how at the louvre he had often seen as she passed by him in the fu	37.42652882413671
he thought of aramis who without possessing any greater advantages than himself 	89.29417059118808
he was confessing to himself that he belonged to the latter unhappy class when p	88.51676481490391
i will lay a wager your honor that you and i are thinking of the same thing	76.60969685380714
i doubt it planchet replied dartagnan but what are you thinking of	25.805993606671624
i am thinking sir of those desperate looking men who were drinking in the inn wh	112.81254620900067
always cautious planchet	938.0519329672688
tis instinct your honor	392.79939116398623
well what does your instinct tell you now	79.00228650872016
sir my instinct told me that those people were assembled there for some bad purp	102.63361436361572
ah ah said dartagnan planchets recital agreeing with his own observations	60.24520620544186
one of these two men said he must certainly be at noisy or be coming there this 	73.99383515413203
art thou sure said the man in the cloak	33.67000975728103
yes my prince	118.93927758878569
my prince interrupted dartagnan	115.9532600802477
yes my prince but listen	169.05856760117007
if he is herethis is what the other man saidlets see decidedly what to do with h	96.33116964713673
what to do with him answered the prince	42.348068154826564
yes he s not a man to allow himself to be taken anyhow hell defend himself	77.97338792637467
well we must try to take him alive	81.71268144307659
have you cords to bind him with and a gag to stop his mouth	105.87024909329523
we have	5.709199271246091
remember that he will most likely be disguised as a horseman	88.89274872185014
yes yes my lord do nt be uneasy	21.28829104953042
besides i shall be there	24.251592480974633
you will assure us that justice	130.70569198844402
yes yes i answer for all that the prince said	71.87329146662063
well then well do our best	174.21891708619214
having said that they went out of the stable	41.92702810885237
well what matters all that to us said dartagnan	61.258801454390415
this is one of those attempts that happen every day	77.66158436553381
are you sure that we are not its objects	47.0963611344608
we why	31610.607270213804
just remember what they said	198.86389755948372
i have seen his servant said one and that applies very well to me	96.3427457814917
he must certainly be at noisy or be coming there this evening said the other and	79.65293394575397
what else	690.4012360767283
then the prince said take notice that in all probability he will be disguised as	85.85379390800823
now then what do you say to that	14.499933012921057
alas my dear planchet said dartagnan sighing we are unfortunately no longer in t	26.397011902965115
those were good old days never fearthese people owe us no grudge	457.5885251609749
is your honor sure	266.8965509176141
i can answer for it they do not	31.730004722858656
well we wo nt speak of it any more then and planchet took his place in dartagnan	51.92886898073158
they had traveled onward about half a mile when planchet came close up to dartag	108.5543632201067
stop sir look yonder he whispered do nt you see in the darkness something pass b	228.42395757146963
impossible returned dartagnan	24.918250593946134
the ground is soaking wet yet i fancy as thou sayest that i see something	147.98308386989206
at this moment the neighing of a horse struck his ear coming through darkness an	70.79014871909514
there are men somewhere about but that s of no consequence to us said dartagnan 	83.77782018125963
at about halfpast eight oclock they reached the first houses in noisy every one 	141.65072892950235
the obscurity was broken only now and then by the still darker lines of the roof	132.88079623568171
here and there a dog barked behind a door or an affrighted cat fled precipitatel	134.0065474642744
these were the only living creatures that seemed to inhabit the village	122.6102938069103
toward the middle of the town commanding the principal open space rose a dark ma	77.57860314451393
dartagnan looked attentively at the building	52.16583189212701
this he said to planchet must be the archbishops chateau the abode of the fair m	83.22703279074412
the convent your honor is at the other end of the village i know it well	42.43409739179278
well then planchet gallop up to it whilst i tighten my horses girth and come bac	117.26979882199025
in about five minutes planchet returned	67.55435861952637
sir he said there is one window of the convent lighted up	81.9068337851781
hem if i were a frondeur said dartagnan i should knock here and should be sure o	41.269068698102494
if i were a monk i should knock yonder and should have a good supper there too w	91.00650750596787
yes added planchet like the famous ass of buridan	124.86841392445993
shall i knock	191.08328664461177
hush replied dartagnan the light no longer burns in yonder window	121.09733209853084
do you hear nothing whispered planchet	35.95579159480093
what is that noise	68.6442020656246
there came a sound like a whirlwind at the same time two troops of horsemen each	99.26349136475191
heyday cried dartagnan drawing his sword and taking refuge behind his horse are 	68.43190327461524
here he is we have him cried the horsemen rushing on dartagnan with naked swords	93.3592686617631
do nt let him escape said a loud voice	36.72818609027128
no my lord be assured we shall not	27.58441576420008
dartagnan thought it was now time for him to join in the conversation	49.44221033895997
halloo gentlemen he called out in his gascon accent what do you want what do you	41.114399923149406
that thou shalt soon know shouted a chorus of horsemen	325.69539768057206
stop stop cried he whom they had addressed as my lord tis not his voice	199.59920451607258
ah just so gentlemen pray do people get into a passion at random at noisy take c	256.7807330170832
the chieftain of the party drew near	153.27529563055325
what are you doing here he asked in a lofty tone as that of one accustomed to co	21.95624750682897
and youwhat are you doing here replied dartagnan	30.135209720956176
be civil or i shall beat you for although one may not choose to proclaim oneself	168.30811509274753
you do nt choose to discover yourself because you are the leader of an ambuscade	56.025978609601516
enough enough what is your name	37.69240690630557
i shall tell you my name in order that you may know where to find me my lord or 	32.917839339759674
do you know monsieur dartagnan	9.522238168142303
lieutenant in the kings musketeers said the voice you are monsieur dartagnan	31.53350900514268
i am	11.254845854547902
then you came here to defend him	51.575146222897736
him whom	130.93131722393827
the man we are seeking	161.20477593157432
it seems said dartagnan that whilst i thought i was coming to noisy i have enter	49.15872459302224
come replied the same lofty tone answer are you waiting for him underneath these	169.7639513695586
i am waiting for no one replied dartagnan who was beginning to be angry	26.66357741697693
i propose to defend no one but myself and i shall defend myself vigorously i giv	99.97959984583075
very well said the voice go away from here and leave the place to us	43.95124954071248
go away from here said dartagnan whose purposes were in conflict with that order	67.91480753466483
eh monsieur said dartagnan i beg you will have a care what you say for if you ut	23.8178644309674
well well rejoined the leader there s no doubt tis a gascon who is speaking and 	73.89197271608008
our blow has failed for tonight let us withdraw	180.71924846529492
we shall meet again master dartagnan continued the leader raising his voice	78.01187935388164
yes but never with the same advantages said dartagnan in a tone of raillery for 	26.053605216035404
very good very good said the voice	23.746053165183636
en route gentlemen	166.8117005952912
and the troop grumbling angrily disappeared in the darkness and took the road to	75.36527968413397
dartagnan and planchet remained for some moments still on the defensive then as 	50.31948711213307
thou seest simpleton said dartagnan to his servant that they wished no harm to u	47.16681740317277
but to whom then	218.0301903636505
ifaith i neither know nor care	668.8462407238594
what i do care for now is to make my way into the jesuits convent so to horse an	109.29386880041244
happen what will the devil take them they ca nt eat us	71.65332925222722
and he mounted his horse	41.55535785449868
planchet had just done the same when an unexpected weight fell upon the back of 	114.98827096243635
hey your honor cried planchet i ve a man behind me	37.48250112756962
dartagnan turned around and plainly saw two human forms on planchets horse	193.71129217791878
tis then the devil that pursues he cried drawing his sword and preparing to atta	76.28486551221661
no no dear dartagnan said the figure tis not the devil tis aramis gallop fast pl	115.19884886341498
and planchet with aramis behind him set off at full gallop followed by dartagnan	50.26113108764726
chapter ix	2.713809485707502
the abb dherblay	19.38562205441316
at the extremity of the village planchet turned to the left in obedience to the 	16.84861303696871
aramis alighted and clapped his hands three times	91.6676815061472
immediately the window was opened and a ladder of rope was let down from it	51.02269465022905
my friend said aramis if you like to ascend i shall be delighted to receive you	27.52060423253946
ah said dartagnan is that the way you return to your apartment	32.78322007647779
after nine at night pardieu said aramis the rule of the convent is very severe	177.66253219114785
pardon me my dear friend said dartagnan i think you said pardieu	18.743346260286422
do you think so said aramis smiling it is possible	16.14780772763652
you have no idea my dear fellow how one acquires bad habits in these cursed conv	95.06343911120332
but will you not go up	31.245860451481075
pass on before me i beg of you	43.186727266759256
as the late cardinal used to say to the late king only to show you the way sire	180.12030221707187
and aramis ascended the ladder quickly and reached the window in an instant	70.79605615590438
dartagnan followed but less nimbly showing plainly that this mode of ascent was 	213.09777108256498
i beg your pardon said aramis noticing his awkwardness if i had known that i was	30.267938469105506
sir said planchet when he saw dartagnan on the summit of the ladder this way is 	29.817837624845666
take them to yonder shed my friend said aramis pointing to a low building on the	55.83443771869649
marry forsooth people do nt die of hunger here	166.3045971716377
and aramis drawing in the ladder closed the window	91.52987838256905
dartagnan then looked around attentively	133.18229973992487
never was there an apartment at the same time more warlike and more elegant	70.15289741029925
at each corner were arranged trophies presenting to view swords of all sorts and	195.70696827311943
exteriorly nothing in the room showed that it was the habitation of an abb	57.068369356221154
the hangings were of damask the carpets from alencon and the bed especially had 	296.7927762029276
you are examining my den said aramis	30.679991126020028
ah my dear fellow excuse me i am lodged like a chartreux	45.339147267942025
but what are you looking for	20.318616847803
i am looking for the person who let down the ladder	76.25235278278865
i see no one and yet the ladder did nt come down of itself	109.49574151914152
no it is bazin	15.595978491893518
ah ah said dartagnan	4.721938388717826
but continued aramis bazin is a well trained servant and seeing that i was not a	38.016418464028476
sit down my dear friend and let us talk	11.896718067438748
and aramis pushed forward a large easychair in which dartagnan stretched himself	101.06570165671067
in the first place you will sup with me will you not asked aramis	20.531406301839382
yes if you really wish it said dartagnan and even with great pleasure i confess 	67.42154864926007
ah my poor friend said aramis you will find meagre fare you were not expected	53.05105891679343
am i then threatened with the omelet of crevecoeur	42.027660298083845
oh let us hope said aramis that with the help of god and of bazin we shall find 	43.50613714217116
bazin my friend come here	56.207267228461426
the door opened and bazin entered on perceiving the musketeer he uttered an excl	27.752597757667548
my dear bazin said dartagnan i am delighted to see with what wonderful composure	18.10430714424836
sir replied bazin i have been taught by the good jesuit fathers that it is permi	30.241682026465668
so far well said aramis we are dying of hunger	31.448997883385
serve us up the best supper you can and especially give us some good wine	184.28528585843924
bazin bowed low sighed and left the room	54.1319616069573
now we are alone dear aramis said dartagnan tell me how the devil you managed to	31.43183209174639
ifaith answered aramis as you see from heaven	71.60469200170186
from heaven replied dartagnan shaking his head you have no more the appearance o	39.284498912807166
my friend said aramis with a look of imbecility on his face which dartagnan had 	13.55066060020079
here then is a puzzle for the learned observed dartagnan until now they have nev	114.78163552217991
paradise is at noisy le sec upon the site of the archbishops chateau	64.43595761873091
people do not go out from it by the door but by the window one does nt descend h	53.93442131540286
aramis burst into a fit of laughter	48.61399105327513
you were always a merry companion my dear dartagnan he said and your witty gasco	56.06657380243204
yes there is something in what you say nevertheless do not believe that it is ma	61.591943962242496
a plague ont i shall not do so	70.53518207436234
after having been so long in love with madame de chevreuse you would hardly lay 	77.01908655174844
yes replied aramis with an absent air yes that poor duchess i once loved her muc	79.88789139415546
eventually she was obliged to leave france	33.614953675755885
he was a relentless enemy that damned cardinal continued aramis glancing at the 	94.22147217262406
he had even given orders to arrest her and would have cut off her head had she n	68.05426780196476
for she had a wonderful way of dressing as a man that dear marie i know only one	94.23301945300412
so they made this song about her laboissiere dis moi	185.63069223891148
you know it do nt you	20.818945208877285
no sing it please	1016.5594101434255
aramis immediately complied and sang the song in a very lively manner	162.8678115970329
bravo cried dartagnan you sing charmingly dear aramis	61.9708825548449
i do not perceive that singing masses has spoiled your voice	140.99410358869935
my dear dartagnan replied aramis you understand when i was a musketeer i mounted	40.61399729586685
but to return to our duchess	124.52895148210497
whichthe duchess de chevreuse or the duchess de longueville	32.27973458104859
have i not already told you that there is nothing between me and the duchess de 	34.258683890791346
no i spoke of the duchess de chevreuse did you see her after her return from bru	47.48421494516493
yes she is still beautiful	112.17432670138115
yes said aramis i saw her also at that time	28.584374212885155
i gave her good advice by which she did not profit	108.9030264768815
i ventured to tell her that mazarin was the lover of anne of austria	46.06875104421108
she would nt believe me saying that she knew anne of austria who was too proud t	40.75178907923084
after that she plunged into the cabal headed by the duke of beaufort and the cox	39.86141568724146
you know resumed dartagnan that she has had leave to return to france	53.179950227545774
yes she is come back and is going to commit some fresh folly or another	144.153691368573
oh but this time perhaps she will follow your advice	136.370145730651
oh this time returned aramis i have nt seen her she is much changed	102.15098553601257
in that respect unlike you my dear aramis for you are still the same you have st	35.0840429526917
yes replied aramis i am extremely careful of my appearance	33.91554043184569
do you know that i am growing old i am nearly thirtyseven	36.1507000606837
mind aramisdartagnan smiled as he spokesince we are together again let us agree 	90.85566046739358
formerly i was your junior by two or three years and if i am not mistaken i am t	22.86952701731886
indeed then tis i who am mistaken for you have always been a good chronologist	68.2901060831222
by your reckoning i must be fortythree at least	56.44722449119651
the devil i am do nt let it out at the hotel rambouillet it would ruin me replie	43.880302553137476
do nt be afraid said dartagnan	13.05310443669434
i never go there	197.98463192926033
why what in the world cried aramis is that animal bazin doing bazin hurry up the	114.55969258237998
bazin entered at that moment carrying a bottle in each hand	93.72958269134463
at last said aramis we are ready are we	35.142225723376
yes monsieur quite ready said bazin but it took me some time to bring up all the	60.179657800420685
because you always think you have on your shoulders your beadles robe and spend 	135.56697380005627
but i give you warning that if in polishing your chapel utensils you forget how 	109.4592516655641
bazin scandalized made a sign of the cross with the bottle in his hand	48.97183638144977
dartagnan more surprised than ever at the tone and manners of the abb dherblay w	48.36658649493353
bazin quickly covered the table with a damask cloth and arranged upon it so many	138.4599470507729
but you expected some one then asked the officer	108.35639613039437
oh said aramis i always try to be prepared and then i knew you were seeking me	47.58800702400455
from whom	56.649429888684956
from master bazin to be sure he took you for the devil my dear fellow and hasten	64.10103254267399
oh monsieur said bazin clasping his hands supplicatingly	17.73604741859441
come no hypocrisy you know that i do nt like it	32.2012300465225
you will do much better to open the window and let down some bread a chicken and	53.219574453607784
planchet in fact had bedded and fed his horses and then coming back under the wi	73.09252558624257
bazin obeyed fastened to the end of a cord the three articles designated and let	114.32438589057351
now to supper said aramis	44.82069622184623
the two friends sat down and aramis began to cut up fowls partridges and hams wi	38.42476388671409
the deuce cried dartagnan do you live in this way always	69.57756205126557
yes pretty well	272.9662871098126
the coadjutor has given me dispensations from fasting on the jours maigres on ac	75.71059607000592
nevertheless he died of indigestion in spite of his grace said dartagnan	52.166217449960875
what can you expect replied aramis in a tone of resignation	16.9690297641871
every man that s born must fulfil his destiny	534.7339190808516
if it be not an indelicate question resumed dartagnan have you grown rich	92.028213949606
oh heaven no	174.46399160762942
i make about twelve thousand francs a year without counting a little benefice of	75.78814594972538
and how do you make your twelve thousand francs by your poems	33.938901115697774
no i have given up poetry except now and then to write a drinking song some gay 	262.20324053349873
what sermons do you preach them	204.10820005584986
no i sell them to those of my cloth who wish to become great orators	90.36513934262818
ah indeed and you have not been tempted by the hopes of reputation yourself	63.97354745935426
i should my dear dartagnan have been so but nature said no	127.00856100989188
when i am in the pulpit if by chance a pretty woman looks at me i look at her ag	57.35919118720856
then i speak at random instead of preaching about the torments of hell i talk of	109.41959123113185
an event took place in the church of st	39.91296856428935
louis au marais	285.62377811461414
a gentleman laughed in my face	286.90046439305996
i stopped short to tell him that he was a fool the congregation went out to get 	88.77994280364383
tis true that he came the next morning to my house thinking that he had to do wi	38.35706752064918
and what was the end of the affair	26.472074463467568
we met in the place royaleegad you know about it	40.86294551498161
was i not your second cried dartagnan	72.24124744778602
you were you know how i settled the matter	175.2738154811293
did he die	54.66447393490619
i do nt know	6.930329534114968
but at all events i gave him absolution in articulo mortis	58.2349973821306
tis enough to kill the body without killing the soul	130.56372970973163
bazin made a despairing sign which meant that while perhaps he approved the mora	85.10727385245389
bazin my friend said aramis you do nt seem to be aware that i can see you in tha	20.470431043035305
you will do me the favor to bring us some spanish wine and then to withdraw	61.60307594323794
besides my friend dartagnan has something to say to me privately have you not da	28.604983522671795
dartagnan nodded his head and bazin retired after placing on the table the spani	40.58924507424563
the two friends left alone remained silent face to face	142.60719678819703
aramis seemed to await a comfortable digestion dartagnan to be preparing his exo	107.30747163400059
each of them when the other was not looking hazarded a sly glance	117.01865810855821
it was aramis who broke the silence	48.49198077404169
what are you thinking of dartagnan he began	34.5434670924103
i was thinking my dear old friend that when you were a musketeer you turned your	106.4623970451812
tis true man as you know said aramis is a strange animal made up of contradictio	38.862939865419044
since i became an abb i dream of nothing but battles	219.0407767889076
that is apparent in your surroundings you have rapiers here of every form and to	112.22397537275232
do you still fence well	390.5756995148758
ii fence as well as you did in the old timebetter still perhaps i do nothing els	80.4371365882887
and with whom	150.1311759824043
with an excellent masteratarms that we have here	68.00418220079824
what here	3489.456319570524
yes here in this convent my dear fellow	61.81829711164612
there is everything in a jesuit convent	51.65214267175215
then you would have killed monsieur de marsillac if he had come alone to attack 	49.98667727900349
undoubtedly said aramis and even at the head of his twenty men if i could have d	63.44946480118214
god pardon me said dartagnan to himself i believe he has become more gascon than	28.80761640143581
no i have not asked you that said aramis with his subtle manner but i have expec	30.195543273095755
well i sought you for the single purpose of offering you a chance to kill monsie	67.12447226310067
hold on wait said aramis that is an idea	44.000275706848974
of which i invite you to take advantage my friend	61.04523708998718
let us see with your thousand crowns from the abbey and the twelve thousand fran	62.29545001052489
i i am as poor as job and were you to search my pockets and my boxes i do nt bel	100.47922797164027
peste a hundred pistoles said dartagnan to himself he calls that being as poor a	67.0190905481521
then aloud are you ambitious	232.29764559817778
as enceladus	67.7250097593639
well my friend i bring you the means of becoming rich powerful and free to do wh	72.23928397773456
the shadow of a cloud passed over aramiss face as quickly as that which in augus	49.23977898320523
speak on said aramis	42.99196636097878
one question first	5337.577410898437
do you take any interest in politics	38.30695803975717
a gleam of light shone in aramiss eyes as brief as the shadow that had passed ov	52.10437808972484
no aramis replied	39.47997762277521
then proposals from any quarter will be agreeable to you since for the moment yo	104.84894094042826
it is possible	13.088212514184974
have you my dear aramis thought sometimes of those happy happy happy days of you	107.63898970131835
certainly and more than once regretted them it was indeed a glorious time	123.87659514223307
well those splendidly wild days may chance to come again i am commissioned to fi	211.72141692532588
aramis bowed rather with respect than pleasure at the compliment	167.75046224940235
to meddle in politics he exclaimed in a languid voice leaning back in his easych	58.981721597130935
ah dear dartagnan see how regularly i live and how easy i am here	121.04843305346978
we have experienced the ingratitude of the great as you well know	80.83802583719401
tis true replied dartagnan	4.167358297953933
yet the great sometimes repent of their ingratitude	236.16787000751685
in that case it would be quite another thing	32.800177643989066
come lets be merciful to every sinner besides you are right in another respect w	172.99432673254967
how can you know that you who never interest yourself in politics	78.44166537030794
ah without caring about them myself i live among those who are much occupied in 	268.19041073041336
poet as i am i am intimate with sarazin who is devoted to the prince de conti an	32.704481311010404
i have no doubt of it said dartagnan	9.418416359593452
now my dear friend look upon all i tell you as merely the statement of a monkof 	69.75605152084441
i understand that mazarin is at this very moment extremely uneasy as to the stat	47.29708427485407
i will not contradict you there said dartagnan	22.35597387052648
my first impressions were favorable to the minister i said to myself that a mini	79.25081697662903
dartagnan made a sign with his head which indicated that he entirely approved th	42.847590897095884
this then continued aramis was my first opinion but as i am very ignorant in mat	81.35189766943179
aramis paused	1670.4413039925535
well what asked his friend	146.78267823674923
well i must mortify myself	144.11059918716884
i must confess that i was mistaken	35.21735266984504
monsieur de mazarin is not a man of genius as i thought he is a man of no origin	16.75392572901301
he is an upstart a man of no name who will only be the tool of a party in france	43.20379196790038
he will amass wealth he will injure the kings revenue and pay to himself the pen	130.1184769306567
he is neither a gentleman in manner nor in feeling but a sort of buffoon a punch	100.60469254256722
do you know him i do not	13.816852777981794
hem said dartagnan there is some truth in what you say	33.69147425301924
ah it fills me with pride to find that thanks to a common sort of penetration wi	123.65675854953969
but you speak of him not of his party his resources	105.45081227477493
it is truethe queen is for him	180.58503977293856
something in his favor	73.13903458861715
but he will never have the king	25.476919931536937
a mere child	662.1795907053156
a child who will be of age in four years	52.319833584956555
then he has neither the parliament nor the people with himthey represent the wea	98.16122411209767
dartagnan scratched his ear	307.2139184521959
he was forced to confess to himself that this reasoning was not only comprehensi	58.18756015778424
you see my poor friend that i am sometimes bereft of my ordinary thoughtfulness 	51.703816901652175
i cried dartagnan not in the least	55.52046914633108
you spoke of a mission	150.05323675384
did i i was wrong then no i said what you saythere is a crisis at hand	153.78182216532866
well lets fly the feather before the wind let us join with that side to which th	154.60427057508454
we were once four valiant knightsfour hearts fondly united let us unite again no	242.39800782411672
heres a good opportunity for getting something better than a diamond	193.0186594335397
you are right dartagnan i held a similar project but as i had not nor ever shall	109.28850104831581
every one nowadays wants auxiliaries propositions have been made to me and i con	77.16259668299308
monsieur de gondy the cardinals enemy	68.88891694178973
no the kings friend said aramis the kings friend you understand	103.83926763759779
well it is a question of serving the king the gentlemans duty	68.86681324934803
but the king is with mazarin	29.12475408892874
he is but not willingly in appearance not heart and that is exactly the snare th	91.84352267165829
ah but this is indeed civil war which you propose to me dear aramis	113.40993599969356
war for the king	53.59210068306653
yet the king will be at the head of the army on mazarins side	22.52303202431341
but his heart will be in the army commanded by the duc de beaufort	23.065309703427364
monsieur de beaufort he is at vincennes	9.461250307668445
did i say monsieur de beaufort monsieur de beaufort or another	33.81901686680818
monsieur de beaufort or monsieur le prince	26.404200101977054
but monsieur le prince is to set out for the army he is entirely devoted to the 	50.515709378064535
oh oh said aramis there are questions between them at this very moment	41.82135191894015
and besides if it is not the prince then monsieur de gondy	27.054470989586378
but monsieur de gondy is to be made a cardinal they are soliciting the hat for h	38.13041248887208
and are there no cardinals that can fight come now recall the four cardinals tha	184.42620184497991
but a humpbacked general	468.6977637292946
under the cuirass the hump will not be seen	69.09096997840781
besides remember that alexander was lame and hannibal had but one eye	90.2662600883662
do you see any great advantage in adhering to this party asked dartagnan	91.2446246371662
i foresee in it the aid of powerful princes	436.0283615453765
with the enmity of the government	49.033160997417326
counteracted by parliament and insurrections	262.9294080741777
that may be done if they can separate the king from his mother	39.95659467035437
that may be done said aramis	9.551601725695559
never cried dartagnan	22.674351979538596
you aramis know anne of austria better than i do	60.11317745857086
do you think she will ever forget that her son is her safeguard her shield the p	57.04967755478598
perhaps you are right said aramis thoughtfully therefore i shall not pledge myse	44.26032393753842
to them or to us do you mean aramis	72.54993293491574
to no one	124.20877101306151
i am a priest resumed aramis	29.07537638178392
what have i to do with politics i am not obliged to read any breviary	38.494892490765906
i have a jolly little circle of witty abbs and pretty women everything goes on s	166.67605709323644
well listen my dear aramis said dartagnan your philosophy convinces me on my hon	35.871776252290786
i do nt know what devil of an insect stung me and made me ambitious	96.64762428536058
i have a post by which i live at the death of monsieur de trville who is old i m	43.266702206743076
instead of running after adventures i shall accept an invitation from porthos i 	107.04096102811529
you know he has estatesporthos	57.44196025254139
i should think so indeed	114.00010608534738
ten leagues of wood of marsh land and valleys he is lord of the hill and the pla	94.65693200871365
good said dartagnan to himself	13.03911991989794
that s what i wanted to know	36.48713852560887
porthos is in picardy	38.84971077376989
then aloud	2725.5035986227163
and he has taken his ancient name of vallon	41.726675042355424
to which he adds that of bracieux an estate which has been a barony by my troth	54.35917086847317
so that porthos will be a baron	22.823173111557214
i do nt doubt it	34.50227147562538
the baroness porthos will sound particularly charming	1870.7457484253523
and the two friends began to laugh	14.957225188146001
so dartagnan resumed you will not become a partisan of mazarins	82.75370272315624
nor you of the prince de cond	24.814517890230775
no let us belong to no party but remain friends let us be neither cardinalists n	121.88107200595822
adieu then	137.2614357863142
and dartagnan poured out a glass of wine	24.21876700264383
to old times he said	108.36817715596158
yes returned aramis	19.47170122957547
unhappily those times are past	602.4489213394515
nonsense they will return said dartagnan	52.39441896946907
at all events if you want me remember the rue tiquetonne hotel de la chevrette	30.81012384665358
and i shall be at the convent of jesuits from six in the morning to eight at nig	37.24531087615328
from eight in the evening until six in the morning come in by the window	74.838032664178
adieu dear friend	45.70503215051866
oh i ca nt let you go so i will go with you	30.951499462180447
and he took his sword and cloak	26.9428410206042
he wants to be sure that i go away said dartagnan to himself	30.712302440491914
aramis whistled for bazin but bazin was asleep in the antechamber and aramis was	33.92603780731629
bazin stretched his arms rubbed his eyes and tried to go to sleep again	40.86848936520986
come come sleepy head quick the ladder	707.14916504939
but said bazin yawning portentously the ladder is still at the window	77.20293343902293
the other one the gardeners	273.30269873187245
did nt you see that monsieur dartagnan mounted with difficulty it will be even m	62.67208217437525
dartagnan was about to assure aramis that he could descend easily when an idea c	84.22455127960352
bazin uttered a profound sigh and went out to look for the ladder	46.766802238543185
presently a good solid wooden ladder was placed against the window	125.06648813188686
now then said dartagnan this is something like this is a means of communication	45.64351683412641
a woman could go up a ladder like that	137.49772195862585
aramiss searching look seemed to seek his friends thought even at the bottom of 	162.58110528371245
besides at that moment he put his foot on the first step of the ladder and began	22.70899836176609
in a moment he was on the ground	15.738177507007892
bazin remained at the window	27.30388524865413
stay there said aramis i shall return immediately	31.54338191338916
the two friends went toward the shed	38.05772659246597
at their approach planchet came out leading the two horses	96.00050635968094
that is good to see said aramis	32.79076350846082
there is a servant active and vigilant not like that lazy fellow bazin who is no	87.28675243758765
follow us planchet we shall continue our conversation to the end of the village	22.87015406573073
they traversed the width of the village talking of indifferent things then as th	93.98212913306858
go then dear friend said aramis follow your own career	62.6941108311665
fortune lavishes her smiles upon you do not let her flee from your embrace	152.27631836200234
as for me i remain in my humility and indolence	49.34946739119314
thus tis quite decided said dartagnan that what i have to offer to you does not 	70.60056282232864
on the contrary it would tempt me were i any other man rejoined aramis but i rep	48.44083705485734
what i hate today i adore tomorrow and vice versa	537.8668332539697
you see that i can not like you for instance settle on any fixed plan	113.29691510602686
thou liest subtile one said dartagnan to himself	63.3268084662103
thou alone on the contrary knowest how to choose thy object and to gain it steal	196.23456488022768
the friends embraced	537.2654795745831
they descended into the plain by the ladder	82.90493323503009
planchet met them hard by the shed	450.8557320401497
dartagnan jumped into the saddle then the old companions in arms again shook han	152.29323766648804
dartagnan and planchet spurred their steeds and took the road to paris	18.166678452040646
but after he had gone about two hundred steps dartagnan stopped short alighted t	95.8858129694856
what s the matter asked planchet	7.619601323769194
this is the matter be he ever so cunning he shall never say i was his dupe	106.56260396771181
stand here do nt stir turn your back to the road and wait for me	65.30250640011894
having thus spoken dartagnan cleared the ditch by the roadside and crossed the p	75.91466427246188
he had observed between the house that madame de longueville inhabited and the c	38.47390836048046
the moon had now risen and he could see well enough to retrace his road	96.4160016610443
he reached the hedge and hid himself behind it in passing by the house where the	60.833780619029945
in truth in a few minutes he heard steps approaching and low whispers	101.19455243286257
close to the hedge the steps stopped	87.03347877370986
dartagnan knelt down near the thickest part of the hedge	67.94509360965266
two men to the astonishment of dartagnan appeared shortly soon however his surpr	112.5243681109289
calm yourself dear rene said the soft voice the same thing will never happen aga	61.69223366973437
i have discovered a sort of subterranean passage which runs beneath the street a	94.29923019793792
oh answered another voice which dartagnan instantly recognized as that of aramis	137.38440848001116
i swear to you princess that if your reputation did not depend on precautions an	134.27410498923064
yes yes i know you are as brave and venturesome as any man in the world but you 	28.931304004022724
be prudent sensible	1199.1118002552132
i always obey madame when i am commanded by so gentle a voice	124.692888802378
he kissed her hand tenderly	253.63235845432132
ah exclaimed the cavalier with a soft voice	39.36766460971906
what s the matter asked aramis	7.595211887761195
do you not see that the wind has blown off my hat	29.12529571679891
aramis rushed after the fugitive hat	428.65187248866926
dartagnan took advantage of the circumstance to find a place in the hedge not so	46.586785986573666
at that instant the moon inquisitive perhaps like dartagnan came from behind a c	100.79335141976746
aramis returned laughing one hat on his head and the other in his hand and he an	60.723274341259255
good said dartagnan rising and brushing his knees now i have theethou art a fron	43.37239046820157
chapter x	2.5704630938373976
monsieur porthos du vallon de bracieux de pierrefonds	9.29983743251744
thanks to what aramis had told him dartagnan who knew already that porthos calle	52.618211516838876
it was then in the neighborhood of noyon that he must seek that estate	37.781127726518186
his itinerary was promptly determined he would go to dammartin from which place 	157.33259547692057
planchet who was still a little concerned for his safety after his recent escapa	94.13520442702244
dartagnan suggested that he should send word to his wife so that she might not b	68.56873061582658
this reasoning seemed to dartagnan so satisfactory that he no further insisted a	116.82764733197588
at midnight the two travelers were at dammartin but it was then too late to make	27.184659788597436
the next morning dartagnan summoned the host one of those sly normans who say ne	61.96724800902872
dartagnan however gathered from his equivocal replies that the road to the right	105.17130892012862
at nine in the morning he reached nanteuil and stopped for breakfast	43.47122637184727
his host here was a good fellow from picardy who gave him all the information he	73.27793557183065
the bracieux estate was a few leagues from villarscotterets	26.052841192623198
dartagnan was acquainted with villarscotterets having gone thither with the cour	78.66453459073577
he therefore shaped his course toward that place and dismounted at the dauphin d	84.3096962858328
there he ascertained that the bracieux estate was four leagues distant but that 	88.91585283812422
porthos had in fact been involved in a dispute with the bishop of noyon in regar	37.50087912624531
he now called himself du vallon de bracieux de pierrefonds and resided on his ne	50.99705778251496
the travelers were therefore obliged to stay at the hotel until the next day the	46.64785980303224
it is true they might have taken others but there was a great forest to pass thr	62.72173978798447
there was another thing that planchet had no liking for and that was starting on	67.57697552943247
accordingly dartagnan on awaking found his breakfast waiting for him	193.17417502376418
it need not be said that planchet in resuming his former functions resumed also 	118.63363862017108
it was nearly eight oclock when they set out again	42.024644333613544
their course was clearly defined they were to follow the road toward compiegne a	84.80967771970732
the morning was beautiful and in this early springtime the birds sang on the tre	86.45316591444833
in other parts of the forest the light could scarcely penetrate through the foli	60.00120486458672
there came up from all nature in the dawn of day a perfume of herbs flowers and 	137.7383555510101
dartagnan sick of the closeness of paris thought that when a man had three names	80.27122897270527
as to planchet he thought of little or nothing but was happy as a huntinghound i	90.39552251595327
at the extremity of the wood dartagnan perceived the road that had been describe	36.28982778116783
oh oh he said i fancied this castle belonged to the ancient branch of orleans	46.0522895003761
can porthos have negotiated for it with the duc de longueville	50.23511034242847

zounds cried dartagnan do nt call him porthos nor even vallon call him de bracie	55.54472483119942
as he approached the castle which had first attracted his eye dartagnan was conv	43.145478533415556
one might have fancied that some giant had cleaved them with blows from a hatche	70.88543670160836
on arriving at the extremity of the castle dartagnan found himself overlooking a	18.588224092405103
and surmounted by four stately gilded weathercocks	376.43759281832916
dartagnan no longer doubted that this was porthoss pleasant dwelling place	168.34599998178857
the road led straight up to the chateau which compared to its ancestor on the hi	98.84463278246238
dartagnan spurred his horse on and pursued his road followed by planchet at the 	72.70941565994057
in ten minutes dartagnan reached the end of an alley regularly planted with fine	54.85472148376985
in the midst of this avenue was a nobleman dressed in green and with as much gil	36.16227722910907
on his right hand and his left were two footmen with the seams of their dresses 	62.301866574598115
a considerable number of clowns were assembled and rendered homage to their lord	136.61414755860469
ah said dartagnan to himself can this be the seigneur du vallon de bracieux de p	19.203250383471556
this can not be monsieur porthos observed planchet replying as it were to his ma	78.19813335534586
monsieur porthos was six feet high this man is scarcely five	156.20316106891673
nevertheless said dartagnan the people are bowing very low to this person	74.86265974815491
as he spoke he rode toward the tall horseto the man of importance and his valets	104.33027101427227
as he approached he seemed to recognize the features of this individual	66.78261007988147

hey yes thank god i am pretty well said mousqueton	34.29669389548005

ah sir what a cook must monsieur pierrefonds have when he was so fond of eating 	103.56783834805842

if the reality corresponds with appearances i am lost for a man so well off will	198.31854551722876
chapter xi	2.429305246021898
wealth does not necessarily produce happiness	126.72151726966237
dartagnan passed through the iron gate and arrived in front of the chateau	47.60542611406526
he alighted as he saw a species of giant on the steps	65.0856750195027
let us do justice to dartagnan	36.386627339913495
independently of every selfish wish his heart palpitated with joy when he saw th	86.17148817148812
he ran to porthos and threw himself into his arms the whole body of servants arr	34.721347453412264
mousqueton at the head of them wiped his eyes	36.200422750949215
porthos linked his arm in that of his friend	65.31539907854486
ah how delightful to see you again dear friend he cried in a voice which was now	68.06647039801553
forget you oh dear du vallon does one forget the happiest days of flowery youth 	188.62670112598641
yes yes said porthos trying to give to his mustache a curl which it had lost whi	37.80834084521729
yes we did some fine things in our time and we gave that poor cardinal a few thr	104.06296683109197
and he heaved a sigh	62.96065058019962
under any circumstances he resumed you are welcome my dear friend you will help 	49.67105897532502
i have four harriers which are considered the swiftest in the county and a pack 	106.38181237883003
and porthos heaved another sigh	291.76734648494045
but first interposed dartagnan you must present me to madame du vallon	64.76701165584036
a third sigh from porthos	78.78999352781118
i lost madame du vallon two years ago he said and you find me still in afflictio	65.31726779383393
that was the reason why i left my chateau du vallon near corbeil and came to my 	56.03335250890497
poor madame du vallon her temper was uncertain but she came at last to accustom 	106.78509200957033
so you are free now and rich	148.02408713652576
alas groaned porthos i am a widower and have forty thousand francs a year	32.982784594286976
let us go to breakfast	8.257602496131362
i shall be happy to do so the morning air has made me hungry	66.20359180357865
yes said porthos my air is excellent	55.03379466086777
they went into the chateau there was nothing but gilding high and low the cornic	101.93484742797409
a table ready set out awaited them	289.7250697299418
you see said porthos this is my usual style	52.78949275352402
devil take me answered dartagnan i wish you joy of it	47.58987912855552
the king has nothing like it	120.37481261205085
no answered porthos i hear it said that he is very badly fed by the cardinal mon	43.213485907364415
taste this cutlet my dear dartagnan tis off one of my sheep	93.00691411890949
you have very tender mutton and i wish you joy of it	80.0901187381749
said dartagnan	1.9951000768405491
yes the sheep are fed in my meadows which are excellent pasture	90.35217034702767
give me another cutlet	48.57869927164481
no try this hare which i had killed yesterday in one of my warrens	175.59672004044535
zounds what a flavor cried dartagnan ah they are fed on thyme only your hares	168.396499666764
and how do you like my wine asked porthos it is pleasant is nt it	61.726425869135056
it is nothing however but a wine of the country	83.86407315049779
yes a small declivity to the south yonder on my hill gives me twenty hogsheads	188.91834562962197
quite a vineyard hey	664.0768144169813
porthos sighed for the fifth timedartagnan had counted his sighs	172.58821035634443
he became curious to solve the problem	250.67279025769784
well now he said it seems my dear friend that something vexes you you are ill pe	41.60187018088864
excellent my dear friend better than ever	106.62273271532008
i could kill an ox with a blow of my fist	49.655263587916
well then family affairs perhaps	2260.814045668567
family i have happily only myself in the world to care for	89.51961127873301
but what makes you sigh	225.98170061605393
my dear fellow replied porthos to be candid with you i am not happy	17.49687268916414
you are not happy porthos you who have chateau meadows mountains woodsyou who ha	226.6055001668082
my dear friend all those things i have but i am a hermit in the midst of superfl	30.398780269511438
surrounded i suppose only by clodhoppers with whom you could not associate	146.28762563017239
porthos turned rather pale and drank off a large glass of wine	60.02080646643312
no but just think there are paltry country squires who have all some title or an	258.6718091364161
when i first came here being the last comer it was for me to make the first adva	57.46343838848132
i made them but you know my dear friend madame du vallon	32.33759939999274
porthos in pronouncing these words seemed to gulp down something	86.1542732786698
madame du vallon was of doubtful gentility	54.08629341027675
she had in her first marriagei do nt think dartagnan i am telling you anything n	54.27535690026573
i have killed two which has made people hold their tongues but has not made me t	184.1239318674816
so that i have no society i live alone i am sick of itmy mind preys on itself	94.15877313775616
dartagnan smiled	135.25568604691793
he now saw where the breastplate was weak and prepared the blow	124.75860742862874
but now he said that you are a widower your wifes connection can not injure you	74.0333979813362
yes but understand me not being of a race of historic fame like the de courcys w	75.73894115069871
ah if i only were a	60.55296799298301
a baron do nt you mean cried dartagnan finishing his friends sentence	96.91385569678052
ah cried porthos would i were but a baron	82.96350103100741
well my friend i am come to give you this very title which you wish for so much	34.0361076664749
porthos gave a start that shook the room two or three bottles fell and were brok	52.92140750380203
mousqueton ran thither hearing the noise	585.4773301679595
porthos waved his hand to mousqueton to pick up the bottles	47.741514025085195
i am glad to see said dartagnan that you have still that honest lad with you	45.5905292320765
he is my steward replied porthos he will never leave me	29.640616882659042
go away now mouston	93.06005958200228
so he s called mouston thought dartagnan tis too long a word to pronounce mousqu	80.17861550683709
well he said aloud let us resume our conversation later your people may suspect 	103.32391724520458
you can suppose porthos that what i have to say relates to most important matter	119.76026386127141
devil take them let us walk in the park answered porthos for the sake of digesti	32.03924707006449
egad said dartagnan the park is like everything else and there are as many fish 	93.67440216208273
my friend replied porthos i leave fishing to mousquetonit is a vulgar pleasurebu	55.70466396586144
really how very amusing	260.9838088154906
yes replied porthos with a sigh it is amusing	13.47951353187478
dartagnan now no longer counted the sighs	195.68251986743414
they were innumerable	95.25406037947594
however what had you to say to me he resumed let us return to that subject	46.18931124957484
with pleasure replied dartagnan i must however first frankly tell you that you m	74.8886161825267
go into harness again gird on your sword run after adventures and leave as in ol	216.6804506962122
ah hang it said porthos	40.04956595984285
i see you are spoiled dear friend you are corpulent your arm has no longer that 	86.72943673587025
ah my fist is strong enough i swear cried porthos extending a hand like a should	133.89030118504894
so much the better	4.928363288389755
are we then to go to war	48.38627475928934
by my troth yes	29.39581922087579
against whom	112.30186316580912
are you a politician friend	58.39934133183184
not in the least	12.820221405906912
are you for mazarin or for the princes	44.712523478509155
i am for no one	89.52366656690297
that is to say you are for us	29.332992092504266
well i tell you that i come to you from the cardinal	17.98805279157889
this speech was heard by porthos in the same sense as if it had still been in th	31.173742345459512
ho ho what are the wishes of his eminence	47.40729370656423
he wishes to have you in his service	42.30098377139204
and who spoke to him of me	43.04155409059017
rochefortyou remember him	430.4641988540191
yes pardieu it was he who gave us so much trouble and kept us on the road so muc	66.65850042498259
but you know he is now our friend	42.16704108092154
no i did nt know that	11.860787047943617
so he cherishes no resentment	203.1349283647063
you are mistaken porthos said dartagnan	12.261710126464799
it is i who cherish no resentment	66.82379762367616
porthos did nt understand any too clearly but then we know that understanding wa	143.7695471847177
you say then he continued that the count de rochefort spoke of me to the cardina	25.70693003619793
yes and the queen too	49.63734297406653
the queen do you say	41.428437956694594
to inspire us with confidence she has even placed in mazarins hands that famous 	247.6160705815312
but it seems to me said porthos that she would have done much better if she had 	19.223676376709737
so i think replied dartagnan but kings and queens are strange beings and have od	71.8842935744097
yes we are devoted to them repeated porthos and youto whom are you devoted now	85.08950065648051
to the king the queen and to the cardinal moreover i have answered for your devo	44.88727720166787
and you say that you have made certain conditions on my behalf	50.9089473271359
magnificent my dear fellow magnificent in the first place you have plenty of mon	43.94874518018776
porthos began to be suspicious	60.02950762291087
eh my friend said he one never has too much money	55.635353599156865
madame du vallon left things in much disorder i am not much of a hand at figures	112.97113237913466
he is afraid i have come to borrow money thought dartagnan	87.8427485217521
ah my friend said he it is all the better if you are in difficulties	28.658584000948924
how is it all the better	24.965799930760088
yes for his eminence will give you all that you wantland money and titles	81.73501066074724
ah ah ah said porthos opening his eyes at that last word	35.589828109403825
under the other cardinal continued dartagnan we did nt know enough to make our p	49.274552443025776
porthos sighed	377.2951393972572
at the same time continued dartagnan notwithstanding your forty thousand francs 	30.741532651693408
yes indeed said porthos	11.382918856988475
well my dear friend win itit is at the point of your sword	42.57439976072172

i shall retire and die tranquillyat home	269.19810013110424
for my part said porthos i desire to be made a baron	23.90741955303838
you shall be one	61.1237935871617
and have you not seen any of our other friends	45.432585134206334
yes i have seen aramis	19.801899252019123
and what does he wish to be a bishop	23.727858416035673
aramis answered dartagnan who did not wish to undeceive porthos aramis fancy has	70.62776936028868
my offers did not arouse himdid not even tempt him	225.8924958684179
so much the worse he was a clever man	20.262012267719342
and athos	18.900222574508817
i have not yet seen him	20.057656944784597
do you know where i shall find him	15.139256170469151
near blois	6.583763093663015
he is called bragelonne	14.569788024472965
only imagine my dear friend	76.39618280419708
athos who was of as high birth as the emperor and who inherits one estate which 	127.57693531629933
and he has no children with all these titles	82.2643513218846
ah said porthos i have heard that he had adopted a young man who resembles him g	19.690412940975992
what athos our athos who was as virtuous as scipio have you seen him	61.87671915473194
well i shall see him tomorrow and tell him about you but i m afraid entre nous t	48.885593253866915
yes he used to drink a great deal replied porthos	46.94179473613694
and then he was older than any of us added dartagnan	79.94318421066349
some years only	2687.793274644141
his gravity made him look older than he was	151.51992644837384
well then if we can get athos all will be well	38.93208596926344
if we can not we will do without him	47.587519154309646
we two are worth a dozen	121.82813853062892

will it last long	366.53175419339607
byr lady two or three years perhaps	300.60000866183697
so much the better cried porthos	7.791518233537328
you have no idea my friend how my bones ache since i came here	79.03190164163188
sometimes on a sunday i take a ride in the fields and on the property of my neig	43.383094499965416
either they respect or they fear me which is more likely but they let me trample	149.34199396669914
at any rate tell me there s more chance of fighting in paris is there not	60.93417236125984
in that respect my dear friend its delightful	94.6906094113077

ah things go on gaily then said porthos	120.72718434978685
besides which in a short time resumed dartagnan we shall have set battles cannon	116.7522990366509
well then i decide	81.79536513439457
i have your word then	77.00814311170154
yes tis given	2489.56629664588
i shall fight heart and soul for mazarin but	228.52375102812485
but he must make me a baron	27.412834452305844
zounds said dartagnan that s settled already i will be responsible for the baron	50.59461019421602
on this promise being given porthos who had never doubted his friends assurance 	164.54776823767494
chapter xii	2.2167334507815943
porthos was discontented with his condition	77.10624886917805
as they returned toward the castle dartagnan thought of the miseries of poor hum	58.698457248382674
in the position of porthos dartagnan would have been perfectly happy and to make	43.9816275805207
i shall pass all my life thought dartagnan in seeking for a man who is really co	46.87045653133758
whilst making this reflection chance seemed as it were to give him the lie direc	167.2428176777709
when porthos had left him to give some orders he saw mousqueton approaching	47.94815327066234
the face of the steward despite one slight shade of care light as a summer cloud	202.93703831329753
here is what i am looking for thought dartagnan but alas the poor fellow does no	59.81783289086023
he then made a sign for mousqueton to come to him	25.501708526866814
sir said the servant i have a favour to ask you	14.64776183560691
speak out my friend	50.852829562165844
i am afraid to do so	13.492767188760661
perhaps you will think sir that prosperity has spoiled me	74.0965799811398
art thou happy friend asked dartagnan	112.06702585713244
as happy as possible and yet sir you may make me even happier than i am	49.08340875566393
well speak if it depends on me	82.25929123327802
oh sir it depends on you only	80.01923140054262
i listeni am waiting to hear	83.23882029071612
sir the favor i have to ask of you is not to call me mousqueton but mouston	39.42513935188475
since i have had the honor of being my lords steward i have taken the last name 	40.67451349308262
you sir know how necessary subordination is in any large establishment of servan	166.4370019042337
dartagnan smiled porthos wanted to lengthen out his names mousqueton to cut his 	94.64145164642972
well my dear mouston he said rest satisfied	68.89151204550389
i will call thee mouston and if it makes thee happy i will not tutoyer you any l	66.2016661632971
oh cried mousqueton reddening with joy if you do me sir such honor i shall be gr	38.34019863682736
alas thought dartagnan it is very little to offset the unexpected tribulations i	74.19532800650708
will monsieur remain long with us asked mousqueton with a serene and glowing cou	119.47017391781705
i go tomorrow my friend replied dartagnan	73.24272285933885
ah monsieur said mousqueton then you have come here only to awaken our regrets	65.48432859124505
i fear that is true said dartagnan in a low tone	9.769605949934371
dartagnan was secretly touched with remorse not at inducing porthos to enter int	90.43423814614923
he was thinking of these matters when porthos summoned him to dinner	71.25125716248873
what to dinner said dartagnan	73.12006482637874
what time is it then	38.57632220134971
eh why it is after one oclock	104.220185844337
your home is a paradise porthos one takes no note of time	186.33261706324856
i follow you though i am not hungry	55.129188761004734
come if one ca nt always eat one can always drinka maxim of poor athos the truth	205.25812656910114
dartagnan who as a gascon was inclined to sobriety seemed not so sure as his fri	81.59268369261238
meanwhile his misgivings in regard to mousqueton recurred to his mind and with g	75.60489216575564
therefore when at dessert upon a sign from dartagnan porthos had sent away his s	88.73173795263365
porthos said dartagnan who will attend you in your campaigns	44.457120772415855
why replied porthos mouston of course	40.57426748606685
this was a blow to dartagnan	43.55960997971139
he could already see the intendants beaming smile change to a contortion of grie	175.52213152896826
but he said mouston is not so young as he was my dear fellow besides he has grow	36.98121108128628
that may be true replied porthos but i am used to him and besides he would nt be	29.958102546842674
oh blind selflove thought dartagnan	288.09025352574776
and you asked porthos have nt you still in your service your old lackey that goo	50.18516720962209
planchetyes i have found him again but he is lackey no longer	40.801283183606216
what is he then	10.273072853860047
with his sixteen hundred francsyou remember the sixteen hundred francs he earned	268.7808568420772
ah he is a confectioner in the rue des lombards how does it happen then that he 	28.580101498484353
he has been guilty of certain escapades and fears he may be disturbed	83.07600699375806
and the musketeer narrated to his friend planchets adventure	99.91754757742454
well said porthos if any one had told you in the old times that the day would co	41.23170607227405
i should not have believed him but men are changed by events	148.44854777558075
there is nothing truer than that said porthos but what does not change or change	42.41855029291393
taste of this it is a spanish wine which our friend athos thought much of	82.2810635932204
at that moment the steward came in to consult his master upon the proceedings of	66.75096421673804
tell me mouston said porthos are my arms in good condition	50.680581605393456
your arms my lordwhat arms	429.72240851464477
zounds my weapons	529.5832810065424
what weapons	12704.733498640997
my military weapons	1706.3664500830123
yes my lord at any rate i think so	21.61421895802395
make sure of it and if they want it have them burnished up	108.4077149566616
which is my best cavalry horse	248.5935100453039
and the best hack	114.76680406813118
what horse dost thou choose for thyself	373.5580042748704
i like rustaud my lord a good animal whose paces suit me	182.53354698389566
strong thinkest thou	1451.3356974634803
half norman half mecklenburger will go night and day	140.9572656891372
that will do for us	50.999939463044164
see to these horses	330.19427279340607
polish up or make some one else polish my arms	265.3167807058372
then take pistols with thee and a huntingknife	665.5121840626491
are we then going to travel my lord asked mousqueton rather uneasy	54.94700162913995
something better still mouston	397.85051925702146
an expedition sir asked the steward whose roses began to change into lilies	134.90181459181161
we are going to return to the service mouston replied porthos still trying to re	29.57085013837892
into the servicethe kings service mousqueton trembled even his fat smooth cheeks	214.22222938584397
yes and no	77.61882426339696
we shall serve in a campaign seek out all sorts of adventuresreturn in short to 	83.41853805547791
these last words fell on mousqueton like a thunderbolt	79.66535485762235
it was those very terrible old days that made the present so excessively delight	197.9718874715146
the two friends remained alone to speak of the future and to build castles in th	45.93736565550514
the good wine which mousqueton had placed before them traced out in glowing drop	190.44463359846657
mousqueton was however somewhat consoled by dartagnan who the next day told him 	76.7941044679663
butformerlyit appears began mousqueton timidly	985.9735719367518
oh said dartagnan we do nt now make war as we did formerly	76.05064050036617
today its a sort of diplomatic arrangement ask planchet	229.59556572082184
mousqueton inquired therefore the state of the case of his old friend who confir	54.147915854381154
but he added in this war prisoners stand a chance of being hung	168.62349354628668
the deuce they do said mousqueton i think i should like the siege of rochelle be	48.79198656444019
porthos meantime asked dartagnan to give him his instructions how to proceed on 	102.95236201116563
four days replied his friend are necessary to reach blois one day to rest there 	156.42259439395386
set out therefore in a week with your suite and go to the hotel de la chevrette 	23.90917520918302
that s agreed said porthos	42.28405387356997
as to myself i shall go around to see athos for though i do nt think his aid wor	56.12239673805972
the friends then took leave of each other on the very border of the estate of pi	51.51085118509141
at least dartagnan said to himself as he took the road to villarscotterets at le	36.598440370755
that devil porthos is a man of prodigious strength still if athos joins us well 	103.11198394751321
at villarscotterets he wrote to the cardinal	27.791975389948078
my lordi have already one man to offer to your eminence and he is well worth twe	56.60350016507407
i am just setting out for blois	117.04868173778173

two angelic faces	194.80245770619638
the road was long but the horses upon which dartagnan and planchet rode had been	122.3589178654037
he had been raised by circumstances to the rank of a confidant to his master	45.517478693776134
it was many years since dartagnan had opened his heart to any one it happened ho	103.8310980794719
planchet was in truth no vulgar companion in these new adventures he was a man o	102.50351776158178
without courting danger he never shrank from an encounter in short he had been a	167.44829384351632
going along dartagnan shaking his head said	80.21609176279371
i know that my going to athos is useless and absurd but still i owe this courtes	75.30471430876067
oh monsieur athos was a noble gentleman said planchet was he not scattering mone	48.22481892996206
do you remember sir that duel with the englishman in the inclosure des carmes ah	76.4109013514955
i was near him those were his exact words when he stabbed his foe as he said he 	122.01848087820233
yes true as gospel said dartagnan but one single fault has swallowed up all thes	82.02392984791325
i remember well said planchet he was fond of drinkingin truth he drank but not a	79.9932894294287

and how he used to break the stem of a glass or the neck of a bottle there was n	61.42391669778177
and now replied dartagnan behold the sad spectacle that awaits us	103.56882605264254

god knows planchet that i should fly from a sight so sad if i did not wish to sh	35.31110629173824
planchet shook his head and said nothing	21.886583909704214
it was evident that he shared his masters apprehensions	32.00587547786211
and then resumed dartagnan to this decrepitude is probably added poverty for he 	208.6041351958867
i fancy myself there and that i see him staggering and hear him stammering said 	120.41781227877173

at this moment one of those heavy wagons drawn by bullocks which carry the wood 	45.47244260168932
a man carrying a long switch with a nail at the end of it with which he urged on	46.35810849841629

what s your pleasure gentlemen replied the peasant with a purity of accent pecul	50.829059446705195
we are looking for the house of monsieur de la fere said dartagnan	12.114052822207606
the peasant took off his hat on hearing this revered name	112.48273891260231
gentlemen he said the wood that i am carting is his i cut it in his copse and i 	86.06472097330287
dartagnan determined not to question this man he did not wish to hear from anoth	41.85540672734771
the chateau he said to himself what chateau ah i understand athos is not a man t	71.96427223616243
he had a heavy handdear old athosafter drinking	121.35896233866009
dartagnan after asking the man the right way continued his route agitated in spi	239.74243116921767
he checked by degrees the speed of his horse and went on his head drooping as if	37.73786140366116
soon as the road turned the chateau de la valliere appeared in view then a quart	45.566220354609385
on beholding this house dartagnan calm as he was in general felt an unusual dist	90.58779789044183
he proceeded nevertheless and came opposite to an iron gate ornamented in the ta	135.39835954873914
through the gate was seen kitchengardens carefully attended to a spacious courty	129.26210380399334
we are mistaken said dartagnan	15.096972520124993
this can not be the establishment of athos	24.713833032288473
good heavens suppose he is dead and that this property now belongs to some one w	66.75615260080136
alight planchet and inquire for i confess that i have scarcely courage so to do	77.74876939648048
planchet alighted	2063.5982059098887
thou must add said dartagnan that a gentleman who is passing by wishes to have t	83.15130718070877
planchet leading his horse by the bridle drew near to the gate and rang the bell	56.34645978207225
does monsieur le comte de la fere live here asked planchet	33.15866763676499
yes monsieur it is here he lives the servant replied to planchet who was not in 	50.97391297410497
a nobleman retired from service is he not	156.72691114896017
and who had a lackey named grimaud persisted planchet who had prudently consider	134.34404055143662
monsieur grimaud is absent from the chateau for the time being said the servitor	75.56243575162723
then cried planchet joyously i see well that it is the same comte de la fere who	27.863330791226424

why did nt you say so said the servitor opening the gate	29.77949434354633
but where is your master	55.411158931703206
he is following me	304.6086981606113
the servitor opened the gate and walked before planchet who made a sign to darta	33.721746926043366
the latter his heart palpitating more than ever entered the courtyard without di	193.58506525162537
whilst planchet was standing on the steps before the house he heard a voice say	44.19329260972437
well where is this gentleman and why do they not bring him here	47.415149789251466
this voice the sound of which reached dartagnan reawakened in his heart a thousa	44.6463400881514
he vaulted hastily from his horse whilst planchet with a smile on his lips advan	51.227020528141175
but i know you my lad said athos appearing on the threshold	34.321209029136945
oh yes monsieur le comte you know me and i know you	16.933064961946574
i am planchetplanchet whom you know well	50.640010410459624
but the honest servant could say no more so much was he overcome by this unexpec	116.343605359615
what planchet is monsieur dartagnan here	41.71243134433245
here i am my friend dear athos cried dartagnan in a faltering voice and almost s	30.579134223925436
at these words a visible emotion was expressed on the beautiful countenance and 	51.04092071278777
he rushed toward dartagnan with eyes fixed upon him and clasped him in his arms	47.233268525377476
dartagnan equally moved pressed him also closely to him whilst tears stood in hi	428.25266648261527
athos then took him by the hand and led him into the drawingroom where there wer	27.417913184175507
every one arose	254.15306089341752
i present to you he said monsieur le chevalier dartagnan lieutenant of his majes	85.48923690411162
dartagnan received the compliments of those who were present in his own way and 	54.9733921421788
strange athos was scarcely aged at all his fine eyes no longer surrounded by tha	67.71467653136494
his face a little elongated had gained in calm dignity what it had lost in fever	284.95610957875493
his hand always wonderfully beautiful and strong was set off by a ruffle of lace	156.25113579025214
he was less stiff than formerly	144.03296956737617
his long dark hair softly powdered here and there with silver tendrils fell eleg	222.3314046876506
meanwhile the guests seeing that the two friends were longing to be alone prepar	39.063333286936704
ah tis raoul who is come home	234.216052779302
athos as the name of raoul was pronounced looked inquisitively at dartagnan in o	42.284154686730574
but dartagnan was still in confusion and turned around almost mechanically when 	134.80523123363983
nevertheless dartagnan was struck by the appearance of this new personage	25.961271337377354
it seemed to explain to him the change in athos a resemblance between the boy an	83.33933977427048
he remained listening and gazing	300.95842196240994
here you are home again raoul said the comte	62.44820075775808
yes sir replied the youth with deep respect and i have performed the commission 	56.16215125914562
but what s the matter raoul said athos very anxiously	30.320114943397066
you are pale and agitated	85.60582110976847
sir replied the young man it is on account of an accident which has happened to 	19.569235792519912
to mademoiselle de la valliere asked athos quickly	37.053325072498325
what is it cried many persons present	359.5186674056877
she was walking with her nurse marceline in the place where the woodmen cut the 	77.93149663745645
she saw me also and in trying to jump from the end of a pile of wood on which sh	33.73464537736402
i fear that she has badly sprained her ankle	158.3280477586963
oh heavens cried athos	11.558516267277376
and her mother madame de saintremy have they yet told her of it	104.38590472106742
no sir madame de saintremy is at blois with the duchess of orleans	14.963028326385114
i am afraid that what was first done was unskillful if not worse than useless	265.0617268596458
i am come sir to ask your advice	50.943357019368065
send directly to blois raoul or rather take horse and ride immediately yourself	133.14363003689564
raoul bowed	70.03825251640106
but where is louise asked the comte	33.50861846448129
i have brought her here sir and i have deposited her in charge of charlotte who 	74.34616065544628
the guests now all took leave of athos excepting the old duc de barbe who as an 	97.29952185148495
you are right sir said athos	4.989246535767097
she will be the sooner with her mother	65.64978186890748
as for you raoul i am sure it is your fault some giddiness or folly	65.31969720364033
no sir i assure you muttered raoul it is not	28.293532568271623
oh no no i declare it is not cried the young girl while raoul turned pale at the	25.230608016900423
nevertheless raoul you must go to blois and you must make your excuses and mine 	32.67473234177858
the youth looked pleased	648.7296831651687
he again took in his strong arms the little girl whose pretty golden head and sm	118.33713603561638

the castle of bragelonne	22.201114247396788
whilst this scene was going on dartagnan remained with open mouth and a confused	70.0690177622804
everything had turned out so differently from what he expected that he was stupe	88.84668559414742
athos who had been observing him and guessing his thoughts took his arm and led 	46.473409044575895
whilst supper is being prepared he said smiling you will not my friend be sorry 	113.09844224480362
true monsieur le comte replied dartagnan who felt that by degrees athos was resu	31.129662249623163
athos smiled	82.27078475215156
first and foremost dear dartagnan we have no title such as count here	205.9624641265742
when i call you chevalier it is in presenting you to my guests that they may kno	72.57103865163147
but to you dartagnan i am i hope still dear athos your comrade your friend	89.93428414431344
do you intend to stand on ceremony because you are less attached to me than you 	90.58702037247254
oh god forbid	73.75880098473961
then let us be as we used to be let us be open with each other	36.4851203643051
you are surprised at what you see here	80.79159055677651
but above all things i am a marvel to you	99.86610487325285
i confess it	54.66614218771554
i am still young am i not should you not have known me again in spite of my eigh	55.60464149268024
on the contrary i do not find you the same person at all	20.703129689903168
i understand cried athos with a gentle blush	72.65569616009884
everything dartagnan even folly has its limit	499.2312618208776
then your means it appears are improved you have a capital houseyour own i presu	322.0440198681943
athos smiled	87.89197916875209
yes i inherited this little property when i quitted the army as i told you	53.87797428650166
the park is twenty acrestwenty comprising kitchengardens and a common	302.96038853024066
i have two horsesi do not count my servants bobtailed nag	100.83382776163256
my sporting dogs consist of two pointers two harriers and two setters	124.88068015822356
but then all this extravagance is not for myself added athos laughing	76.12167812143936
yes i see for the young man raoul said dartagnan	22.309081108976894
you guess aright my friend this youth is an orphan deserted by his mother who le	208.61567405855882
i have brought him up	39.21764405753233
it is raoul who has worked in me the change you see i was dried up like a misera	64.6749213679224
this child has caused me to recover what i had lost	48.930334847460266
i had no longer any wish to live for myself i have lived for him	39.20813604166485
i have corrected the vices that i had i have assumed the virtues that i had not	82.58797887560728
precept something but example more	1696.319790624382
i may be mistaken but i believe that raoul will be as accomplished a gentleman a	43.903848096596576
the remembrance of milady recurred to dartagnan	37.60432477266353
and you are happy he said to his friend	25.751680066962475
as happy as it is allowed to one of gods creatures to be on this earth but say o	90.16774700128938
you are too bad athos one can hide nothing from you answered dartagnan	95.09109429894421
i wished to ask you if you ever feel any emotions of terror resembling	95.6342614645558
remorse i finish your phrase	367.22802299906823
yes and no	76.73564733138895
i do not feel remorse because that woman i profoundly hold deserved her punishme	150.52514031322687
had she one redeeming trait i doubt it	310.72174480415043
i do not feel remorse because had we allowed her to live she would have persiste	102.15098553601257
but i do not mean my friend that we were right in what we did	33.98438244308
perhaps all blood demands some expiation	787.752699843561
hers had been accomplished it remains possibly for us to accomplish ours	190.84562282123605
i have sometimes thought as you do athos	68.72526185140384
she had a son that unhappy woman	123.83247848401221
have you ever heard of him	12.468899036393092
he must be about twentythree years of age said athos in a low tone	19.34755659444882
i often think of that young man dartagnan	126.59710179731732
strange for i had forgotten him said the lieutenant	44.82650983001862
athos smiled the smile was melancholy	162.00959214984496
and lord de winterdo you know anything about him	53.01871428089797
i know that he is in high favor with charles i	26.133665872675675
the fortunes of that monarch now are at low water	485.1241560370348
he shed the blood of strafford that confirms what i said just nowblood will have	141.4972838358679
and the queen	19.191656767837298
what queen	11139.074338132496
madame henrietta of england daughter of henry iv	15.1829432576131
she is at the louvre as you know	24.604022515020688
yes and i hear in bitter poverty	138.05634456151634
her daughter during the severest cold was obliged for want of fire to remain in 	233.54424022885195
do you grasp that said athos shrugging his shoulders the daughter of henry iv	28.16791045864439
shivering for want of a fagot why did she not ask from any one of us a home inst	113.02323555284792
have you ever seen the queen of england inquired dartagnan	13.879783000672658
no but my mother as a child saw her	85.79899504826791
did i ever tell you that my mother was lady of honor to marie de medici	31.81131925568118
you know athos you never spoke much of such matters	176.58525771801888
ah mon dieu yes you are right athos replied but then there must be some occasion	65.11504100615309
porthos would nt have waited for it so patiently said dartagnan with a smile	45.12391984441302
every one according to his nature my dear dartagnan	60.40113755074409
porthos in spite of a touch of vanity has many excellent qualities	136.71515606951323
have you seen him	5.2538777451383005
i left him five days ago said dartagnan and he portrayed with gascon wit and spr	49.996355430886
i sometimes wonder replied athos smiling at that gayety which recalled the good 	167.0355227720945
friendship throws out deep roots in honest hearts dartagnan	540.8664331062645
believe me it is only the evilminded who deny friendship they can not understand	103.29933509702641
and aramis	19.421470203757245
i have seen him also said dartagnan but he seemed to me cold	40.91509131315307
ah you have seen aramis said athos turning on dartagnan a searching look	41.70305424594136
why it is a veritable pilgrimage my dear friend that you are making to the templ	21.176321032832114
why yes replied dartagnan with embarrassment	62.80811385635052
aramis you know continued athos is naturally cold and then he is always involved	157.47189799332017
i believe he is at this moment in a very complicated one said dartagnan	28.6834864817462
athos made no reply	30.893492668277155
he is not curious thought dartagnan	78.56849220454983
athos not only failed to reply he even changed the subject of conversation	159.84688140621262
you see said he calling dartagnans attention to the fact that they had come back	59.52740224721254
all is charming and everything savors of nobility replied dartagnan	103.37812701241995
at this instant they heard the sound of horses feet	40.622267532111465
tis raoul who has come back said athos and we can now hear how the poor child is	39.53992589661515
in fact the young man appeared at the gate covered with dust entered the courtya	29.71968032303943
monsieur said athos placing his hand on dartagnans shoulder monsieur is the chev	22.603132069239575
monsieur said the young man saluting again and more profoundly monsieur le comte	59.85854958454841
that little compliment could not fail to move dartagnan	253.64421098189104
he extended a hand to raoul and said	43.04507406833166
my young friend all the praises that are given me should be passed on to the cou	66.98222209253102
but he will make it up in you i am sure	39.26621107126931
i like your manner raoul and your politeness has touched me	97.08809322107022
athos was more delighted than can be told	205.0269788979631
he looked at dartagnan with an expression of gratitude and then bestowed on raou	18.449964152316106
now said dartagnan to himself noticing that silent play of countenance i am sure	90.09932440628933
i hope the accident has been of no consequence	74.53709641039204
they do nt yet know sir on account of the swelling but the doctor is afraid some	98.53066248863274
at this moment a little boy half peasant half footboy came to announce supper	53.26664434572712
athos led his guest into a diningroom of moderate size the windows of which open	104.75958641957871
dartagnan glanced at the dinner service	110.6183688300718
the plate was magnificent old and appertaining to the family	130.03319257054596
dartagnan stopped to look at a sideboard on which was a superb ewer of silver	49.873634314802516
that workmanship is divine he exclaimed	502.8323455126468
yes a chef doeuvre of the great florentine sculptor benvenuto cellini replied at	105.26201847107158
what battle does it represent	340.4857543266784
that of marignan just at the point where one of my forefathers is offering his s	88.05264175086941
who has broken his	59.4789406139186
it was on that occasion that my ancestor enguerrand de la fere was made a knight	56.3952733574802
michael besides which the king fifteen years afterward gave him also this ewer a	211.46090728580307
men were giants in those times said athos now we are pigmies in comparison	65.9922326737772
let us sit down to supper	17.78047370025289
call charles he added addressing the boy who waited	69.71212588830426
my good charles i particularly recommend to your care planchet the laquais of mo	102.66900373725595
he likes good wine now you have the key of the cellar	184.77160641673856
he has slept a long time on a hard bed so he wo nt object to a soft one take eve	177.98211425092487
charles bowed and retired	24.129938271194803
you think of everything said dartagnan and i thank you for planchet my dear atho	18.147462098760258
raoul stared on hearing this name and looked at the count to be quite sure that 	54.15292511530576
that name sounds strange to you said athos smiling it was my nom de guerre when 	108.29441183872896
my friend is still so kind as to address me by that old and well beloved appella	72.95202799905655
tis an illustrious name said the lieutenant and had one day triumphal honors pai	150.92791080702779
what do you mean sir inquired raoul	8.430890965474147
you have not forgotten st	23.215124882703122
gervais athos and the napkin which was converted into a banner and he then relat	55.16737163933297
dartagnan does not tell you raoul said athos in his turn that he was reckoned on	21.344245978304034
he was eighteen only three years older than you are raoul when i saw him set to 	70.44164130052341
and did monsieur dartagnan come off the conqueror asked the young man with glist	44.59730645521393
i killed one man if i recollect rightly replied dartagnan with a look of inquiry	54.59548156961917
wounded said athos it was a phenomenon of skill	28.409498870556146
the young man would willingly have prolonged this conversation far into the nigh	131.1171244365037
dartagnan would fain have declared that he was not fatigued but athos insisted o	38.64229568583476

athos as a diplomatist	49.71617570549857

being naturally goodhearted and having had once a liking for athos which had gro	130.68712035940888
he admitted without annoyance the continued superiority of athos over himself de	536.4537208332516
nevertheless it seemed to him that athos was not in all respects sincere and fra	38.247556856931645
who was the youth he had adopted and who bore so striking a resemblance to him w	96.29929653009347
it was evident either that he no longer possessed the confidence of his friend o	42.200934673636475
he could not help thinking of m	61.69602859872083
rochefort whom he had seen in notre dame could de rochefort have forestalled him	69.71039736047018
the clear and vigorous intellect of athos would render him more open to convicti	177.53905904776892
he would enter into the ministers schemes with the more ardor because his natura	143.14486707308834
resolved to seek an explanation on all these points on the following day dartagn	47.61372370030819
he determined to cultivate the goodwill of the youth raoul and either whilst fen	66.43200299030941

besides to tell truth whilst dartagnan was quite disposed to adopt a subtle cour	262.5777172380991
it seemed to him that if porthos and aramis deemed him superior to them in the a	55.05043470433767
ah why is not grimaud the taciturn grimaud here thought dartagnan there are so m	112.90133993805101
there reigned a perfect stillness in the house	157.0472456962002
dartagnan had heard the door shut and the shutters barred the dogs became in the	108.44437136681664
at last a nightingale lost in a thicket of shrubs in the midst of its most melod	53.39188395889785
not a sound was heard in the castle except of a footstep up and down in the cham	50.254600674766664
he is walking about and thinking thought dartagnan but of what it is impossible 	119.40769656330423
at length athos went to bed apparently for the noise ceased	91.54982625107989
silence and fatigue together overcame dartagnan and sleep overtook him also	436.18349337103973
he was not however a good sleeper	58.537123366969816
scarcely had dawn gilded his window curtains when he sprang out of bed and opene	167.8387940752372
somebody he perceived was in the courtyard moving stealthily	156.65906807781116
true to his custom of never passing anything over that it was within his power t	120.97918839742752
the young man was opening the door of the stable	27.0220390426706
he then with noiseless haste took out the horse that he had ridden on the previo	60.94015812482393
the road as dartagnan had observed was the way to blois	75.8503660139944
so thought the gascon heres a young blade who has already his love affair who do	141.61135605751122
he s not going to hunt for he has neither dogs nor arms he s not going on a mess	88.02548049975539
why does he go in secret is he afraid of me or of his father for i am sure the c	52.096664194029636
by jove i shall know about that soon for i shall soon speak out to athos	60.99524892907771
day was now advanced all the noises that had ceased the night before reawakened 	81.85689610683153
the bird on the branch the dog in his kennel the sheep in the field the boats mo	79.11255172241292
the latter leaving the shore abandoned themselves gaily to the current	356.72682441084413
the gascon gave a last twirl to his mustache a last turn to his hair brushed fro	115.2557165750514
scarcely had he descended the last step of the threshold when he saw athos bent 	42.46622114798518
goodmorning my dear host cried dartagnan	21.633645058355985
goodday to you have you slept well	156.21776051153822
excellently athos but what are you looking for you are perhaps a tulip fancier	50.36695802280177
my dear friend if i am you must not laugh at me for being so	53.36902646070698
in the country people alter one gets to like without knowing it all those beauti	179.4669372401576
i was looking anxiously for some iris roots i planted here close to this reservo	183.49515132820127
these gardeners are the most careless people in the world in bringing the horse 	69.86157267153332
dartagnan began to smile	31.141346496475094
ah you think so do you	53.75452926884713
and he took his friend along the alley where a number of tracks like those which	116.6906865786422
here are the horses hoofs again it seems athos he said carelessly	129.02212755049442
yes indeed the marks are recent	316.6044605905383
quite so replied the lieutenant	32.90499430309739
who went out this morning athos asked uneasily	88.2492330152422
has any horse got loose	939.71646206771
not likely answered the gascon these marks are regular	135.7323677081506
where is raoul asked athos how is it that i have not seen him	15.159493600770181
hush exclaimed dartagnan putting his finger on his lips and he related what he h	27.46042968738615
ah he s gone to blois the poor boy	46.072881080285676
ah to inquire after the little la valliere she has sprained her foot you know	116.96382069752286
you think he has	39.29885048221352
i am sure of it said athos do nt you see that raoul is in love	13.945646215483674
indeed with whomwith a child seven years old	259.8270338578938
dear friend at raouls age the heart is so expansive that it must encircle one ob	51.226641911863524
well his love is half real half fanciful	474.3338921730856
she is the prettiest little creature in the world with flaxen hair blue eyesat o	38.81116089242394
but what say you to raouls fancy	73.63506801477888
nothingi laugh at raoul but this first desire of the heart is imperious	113.5000658622932
i remember just at his age how deep in love i was with a grecian statue which ou	110.13573526102677
gave my father insomuch that i was mad with grief when they told me that the sto	23.314433844869072
it is mere want of occupation	160.5367934580251
you do not make raoul work so he takes his own way of employing himself	110.04476122130761
exactly therefore i think of sending him away from here	89.37024868031394
you will be wise to do so	18.46991475613526
no doubt of it but it will break his heart	55.0049620843794
so long as three or four years ago he used to adorn and adore his little idol wh	74.59572831101133
the parents of little la valliere have for a long time perceived and been amused	271.91881816338554
nonsense however raoul must be diverted from this fancy	100.64610094604245
send him away or you will never make a man of him	43.17896438985123
i think i shall send him to paris	23.28538051474296
so thought dartagnan and it seemed to him that the moment for attack had arrived	51.796513780144984
suppose he said we roughly chalk out a career for this young man	105.78859931308521
i wish to consult you about some thing	64.57631052288092
do so	158.48364736222362
do you think it is time for us to enter the service	23.33029790891432
but are you not still in the serviceyou dartagnan	29.986700746279176
i mean active service	2784.271990662248
our former life has it still no attractions for you would you not be happy to be	64.3068558435813
do you propose to me to do so dartagnan	16.107875583940995
decidedly and honestly	516.3696236853494
on whose side asked athos fixing his clear benevolent glance on the countenance 	54.38027422845796
ah devil take it you speak in earnest	270.3554687944774
and must have a definite answer	270.0404539835501
listen dartagnan	24.052833110135943
there is but one person or rather one cause to whom a man like me can be usefult	59.75123940502724
exactly answered the musketeer	90.97309927050289
yes but let us understand each other returned athos seriously	66.02588005829077
if by the cause of the king you mean that of monsieur de mazarin we do not under	41.892625374723096
i do nt say exactly answered the gascon confused	82.55277974936965
come dartagnan do nt let us play a sidelong game your hesitation your evasion te	85.23906538700697
ah my dear athos	7.946298498223053
you know that i am not alluding to you you are the pearl of brave bold men	26.581443405832353
i speak of that spiteful and intriguing italianof the pedant who has tried to pu	52.12753905878755
you are more impetuous than you were returned dartagnan	87.96237450586845
age has warmed not chilled your blood	330.60231735835885
who informed you this was the master i propose to you devil take it he muttered 	184.2189528751269
well then said athos what are your schemes what do you propose	27.160151978841714
zounds nothing more than natural	247.8889684268901
you live on your estate happy in golden mediocrity	526.2295548335715
porthos has perhaps sixty thousand francs income	137.3868323710575
aramis has always fifty duchesses quarreling over the priest as they quarreled f	127.84640740802708
in fact i am dead	42.724342869667716
well when there is some idea of being resuscitated you say he s a scoundrel an i	101.48274484483456
athos was for a few moments thoughtful	43.75334335399501
good dartagnan is for mazarin he said to himself	23.6033552622182
from that moment he grew very guarded	125.25006413799929
on his side dartagnan became more cautious also	169.39748317288948
you spoke to me athos resumed of porthos have you persuaded him to seek his fort	69.8126868958069
doubtless he has	22.83146197288792
but such is man we always want something more than we already have	409.39535990173135
what does porthos wish for	74.15914402416391
to be a baron	25.192228615964435
ah true i forgot said athos laughing	25.001831433213404
tis true thought the gascon where has he heard it does he correspond with aramis	60.05633458449413
the conversation was interrupted by the entrance of raoul	46.13193932120815
is our little neighbor worse asked dartagnan seeing a look of vexation on the fa	47.95541296910646
ah sir replied raoul her fall is a very serious one and without any ostensible i	81.59894786723306
this is terrible said athos	25.97673149348887
and what makes me all the more wretched sir is that i was the cause of this misf	44.1693285672695
how so asked athos	13.214671330079998
it was to run to meet me that she leaped from that pile of wood	79.27451468242475
there s only one remedy dear raoulthat is to marry her as a compensation	72.81186991344613
remarked dartagnan	2.9935007858361518
ah sir answered raoul you joke about a real misfortune that is cruel indeed	108.27892130684742
the good understanding between the two friends was not in the least altered by t	70.31582790894906
they breakfasted with a good appetite looking now and then at poor raoul who wit	148.12929374981803
after breakfast two letters arrived for athos who read them with profound attent	141.16517630084374
the other was in a feminine hand long and crossed	191.5500031582035
come said dartagnan to raoul seeing that athos wished to be alone come let us ta	38.184596939948975
and they both went into a low room where there were foils gloves masks breastpla	101.95015956965088
in a quarter of an hour athos joined them and at the same moment charles brought	16.586853757654175
it was now athoss turn to take a sly look	65.54196473197047
dartagnan read the letter with apparent calmness and said shaking his head	74.45496845326828
see dear friend what it is to belong to the army	47.71627439417385
faith you are indeed right not to return to it	58.75087718252563
monsieur de trville is ill so my company ca nt do without me there my leave is a	70.1233993834637
do you return to paris asked athos quickly	14.816174868512123
egad yes but why do nt you come there also	83.70985562538186
athos colored a little and answered	419.92926036045105
should i go i shall be delighted to see you there	34.44009800373069
halloo planchet cried the gascon from the door we must set out in ten minutes gi	22.159142176444124
then turning to athos he added	12.257413452774415
i seem to miss something here	199.7431629972711
i am really sorry to go away without having seen grimaud	50.15100658353476
grimaud replied athos	27.804322599574704
i m surprised you have never so much as asked after him	154.5350619940106
i have lent him to a friend	44.37916698719227
who will understand the signs he makes returned dartagnan	209.87534267814385
i hope so	89.33663172575432
the friends embraced cordially dartagnan pressed raouls hand	202.00787747276695
will you not come with me he said i shall pass by blois	23.411309627605746
raoul turned toward athos who showed him by a secret sign that he did not wish h	27.493630325950082
no monsieur replied the young man i will remain with monsieur le comte	20.902052794131144
adieu then to both my good friends said dartagnan may god preserve you as we use	109.20114278501788
athos waved his hand raoul bowed and dartagnan and planchet set out	50.043664678163786
the count followed them with his eyes his hands resting on the shoulders of the 	22.821083683299634
raoul we set out tonight for paris	77.6954018776168
eh cried the young man turning pale	13.739170864501915
you may go and offer your adieux and mine to madame de saintremy	40.66261632759601
i shall wait for you here till seven	89.02573248619261
the young man bent low with an expression of sorrow and gratitude mingled and re	24.84569238699687
as to dartagnan scarcely on his side was he out of sight when he drew from his p	50.8222613711611
return immediately to paris	51.61543289852408
the epistle is laconic said dartagnan and if there had not been a postscript pro	47.13907180725794
and he read that welcome postscript which made him forget the abruptness of the 	131.37678297976646
go to the kings treasurer at blois tell him your name and show him this letter y	44.194261978542386
assuredly said dartagnan i admire this piece of prose	47.09357651220529
the cardinal writes better than i thought	207.35140423317011
come planchet let us pay a visit to the kings treasurer and then set off	22.04409482956877
toward paris sir	57.080425686905826
toward paris	4.530851068822534
and they set out at as hard a canter as their horses could maintain	144.36163568607202
chapter xvi	2.5360165522957803
the duc de beaufort	7.849915501237894
the circumstances that had hastened the return of dartagnan to paris were as fol	70.21109370855733
one evening when mazarin according to custom went to visit the queen in passing 	87.74683852001975
there was a dispute among the guards	57.04916069241103
i tell you one of them was saying that if coysel predicted that tis as good as t	66.90851411173968
deuce take it friend if he s one of thy friends thou wilt ruin him in saying so	122.3267155098178
because he may be tried for it	39.36807759512223
ah absurd they do nt burn sorcerers nowadays	258.3084455033289
no tis not a long time since the late cardinal burnt urban grandier though	125.49277797586785
my friend urban grandier was nt a sorcerer he was a learned man	50.92574859116828
he did nt predict the future he knew the pastoften a more dangerous thing	117.31387095639217
mazarin nodded an assent but wishing to know what this prediction was about whic	132.74254786174262
i do nt say resumed the guard that coysel is not a sorcerer but i say that if hi	41.35683015768588
how so	17.866392913589028
why in this way if coysel says loud enough for the cardinal to hear him on such 	104.92826438283622
good lord said another guard who might have been thought asleep on a bench but w	121.4247766202273
mazarin started	300.17187878198354
he was an italian and therefore superstitious	64.7998489441888
he walked straight into the midst of the guards who on seeing him were silent	57.36198105641369
what were you saying he asked with his flattering manner that monsieur de beaufo	24.68425404114777
oh no my lord said the incredulous soldier	47.83074476674852
he s well guarded now we only said he would escape	153.76305111595738
who said so	153.78328875006318
repeat your story saint laurent replied the man turning to the originator of the	60.24701604326027
my lord said the guard i have simply mentioned the prophecy i heard from a man n	48.985148597515725
coysel is a madman returned the cardinal	54.395082580059075
no replied the soldier tenacious in his credulity he has foretold many things wh	69.92222790803682
well the queen has not only one son but two then monsieur de coligny was killed 	101.1256219218728
yes said mazarin but the coadjutor is not yet made cardinal	45.29573471034738
no my lord but he will be answered the guard	37.70037883689346
mazarin made a grimace as if he meant to say but he does not wear the cardinals 	38.57108928582083
so my friend its your opinion that monsieur de beaufort will escape	82.7584380634866
that s my idea my lord and if your eminence were to offer to make me at this mom	34.826507250697546
after whitsuntide it would be another thing	42.66462176053981
there is nothing so convincing as a firm conviction	117.33529778462827
it has its own effect upon the most incredulous and far from being incredulous m	214.23315962042253
he went away thoughtful and anxious and returned to his own room where he summon	78.72119534826327
the guard had in fact touched the cardinal in the tenderest point	124.2654645286691
during the whole five years in which the duc de beaufort had been in prison not 	28.893907843594235
it was not possible as he knew well to confine for the whole of his life the gra	46.69377058297517
especially when this young prince was scarcely thirty years of age	59.97091367185717
but however and whensoever he did escape what hatred he must cherish against him	249.50722128994508
but like the miser in the fable he could not sleep for thinking of his treasure	59.69590584155345
often he awoke in the night suddenly dreaming that he had been robbed of monsieu	65.87166489751128
then he inquired about him and had the vexation of hearing that the prisoner pla	63.855267170659474
so much did this one idea haunt the cardinal even in his sleep that when at seve	99.68502801203748
i do not think so my lord said bernouin but you will hear about him for la ramee	19.335207413453126
tell him to come in said mazarin arranging his pillows so that he might receive 	53.65928775063402
the officer entered a large fat man with an open physiognomy	83.97379609187274
his air of perfect serenity made mazarin uneasy	386.1558833542344
approach sir said the cardinal	17.355798510059277
the officer obeyed	319.26934236103034
do you know what they are saying here	17.109032210653293
no your eminence	114.61799369407382
well they say that monsieur de beaufort is going to escape from vincennes if he 	25.7272066638882
the officers face expressed complete stupefaction	2407.266748012849
he opened at once his little eyes and his great mouth to inhale better the joke 	234.22420577414238
escape my lordescape your eminence does not then know where monsieur de beaufort	57.64481527935042
yes i do sir in the donjon of vincennes	27.740174310987975
yes sir in a room the walls of which are seven feet thick with grated windows ea	55.35211060158356
sir replied mazarin with perseverance one may penetrate through a wall with a wa	47.961072866485566
then my lord does not know that there are eight guards about him four in his cha	65.31817102538932
but he leaves his room he plays at tennis at the mall	65.1071860143842
sir those amusements are allowed but if your eminence wishes it we will disconti	74.96485941366318
no no cried mazarin fearing that should his prisoner ever leave his prison he wo	136.87340062320317
he then asked with whom he played	163.75821743424416
my lord either with the officers of the guard with the other prisoners or with m	71.4598301085845
but does he not approach the walls while playing	296.4230686143534
your eminence does nt know those walls they are sixty feet high and i doubt if m	107.91604557405691
hum said the cardinal beginning to feel more comfortable	102.33205247934752
you mean to say then my dear monsieur la ramee	31.755743798864128
that unless monsieur de beaufort can contrive to metamorphose himself into a lit	123.9761072253724
take care you assert a great deal said mazarin	30.6592610152317
monsieur de beaufort told the guards who took him to vincennes that he had often	23.689460415269245
my lord if among these forty there had been one good way he would have been out 	128.55350213341023
come come not such a fool as i fancied thought mazarin	96.61196093876826
besides my lord must remember that monsieur de chavigny is governor of vincennes	33.11219134421825
yes but monsieur de chavigny is sometimes absent	43.65768589471492
when he is absent i am there	51.76762459167601
but when you leave him for instance	45.70559879433001
oh when i leave him i place in my stead a bold fellow who aspires to be his maje	49.68597092492442
i promise you he keeps a good watch over the prisoner	133.00967465865622
during the three weeks that he has been with me i have only had to reproach him 	48.9010738548004
and who is this cerberus	20.664048737318122
a certain monsieur grimaud my lord	48.12083109591316
and what was he before he went to vincennes	34.49277999755204
he was in the country as i was told by the person who recommended him to me	29.322783315168326
and who recommended this man to you	81.27326631441836
the steward of the duc de grammont	15.100215926740965
he is not a gossip i hope	37.7356750970219
lord a mercy my lord i thought for a long time that he was dumb he answers only 	79.51946503267467
it seems his former master accustomed him to that	179.69034527859165
well dear monsieur la ramee replied the cardinal let him prove a true and thankf	50.83177408383038
mazarin was large in promisesquite unlike the virtuous monsieur grimaud so bepra	119.01132702979667
it was now nine oclock	14.315339484893068
the cardinal therefore got up perfumed himself dressed and went to the queen to 	75.87525386798461
the queen who was scarcely less afraid of monsieur de beaufort than the cardinal	73.35901005814968
then when the cardinal had ended	85.60716818157026
alas sir why have we not a grimaud near every prince	132.130618822065
patience replied mazarin with his italian smile that may happen one day but in t	41.70188101405831
well in the meantime	13.72521048966879
i shall still take precautions	266.9749584072428
and he wrote to dartagnan to hasten his return	53.82462761988848
chapter xvii	3.04955839278622
duc de beaufort amused his leisure hours in the donjon of vincennes	42.75488205163799
the captive who was the source of so much alarm to the cardinal and whose means 	114.01858980909137
he had found himself so strictly guarded that he soon perceived the fruitlessnes	58.25377198869532
his vengeance therefore consisted in coining curses on the head of mazarin he ev	53.79637722992674

but these considerations never occurred to the duke and every day the cardinal r	61.90879953226307
after having failed in poetry monsieur de beaufort tried drawing	263.75881214668766
he drew portraits with a piece of coal of the cardinal and as his talents did no	72.18897535004717
monsieur de chavigny the governor of vincennes waited upon the duke to request t	28.66245842576487
the next day the prisoners room was full of pictures and mottoes	54.6693224356614
monsieur de beaufort in common with many other prisoners was bent upon doing thi	174.37682931021038
de beaufort did not venture to draw the cardinals fat face	58.463926308698525
the duke thanked monsieur de chavigny for having as he said cleaned his drawingp	55.667516044762564
in one was depicted the illustrious coxcomb receiving a shower of blows from car	117.20752204631896
the governor of course thought proper to threaten his prisoner that if he did no	133.83272639620304
to this monsieur de beaufort replied that since every opportunity of distinguish	125.54233496334743
nevertheless one day when monsieur de beaufort was walking in the meadow his fir	37.31480815172574
the poor duke swore fell into a rage yelled and declared that they wished to sta	136.71815488226102
his next act was to purchase a dog from one of his keepers	88.70859707807817
with this animal which he called pistache he was often shut up for hours alone s	141.05455741902804
at last when pistache was sufficiently well trained monsieur de beaufort invited	101.4055425983758
the party assembled the room was lighted with waxlights and the prisoner with a 	93.64577471103462
pistache on a signal from his master placed himself on this line raised himself 	132.23840094724198
having been several times up and down it he gave the wand back to his master and	85.30493597446727
the intelligent creature was received with loud applause	423.2561060586969
the first part of the entertainment being concluded pistache was desired to say 	42.60575613230521
nothing could be better done a sundial could not have shown the hour with greate	122.89499830270209
then the question was put to him who was the best jailer in all the prisons in f	77.54206330009336
the dog performed three evolutions around the circle and laid himself with the d	107.97477556140144
then the duke put to pistache this difficult question who was the greatest thief	118.0652423982639
pistache went again around the circle but stopped at no one and at last went to 	81.62128492554791
see gentlemen said m	53.3437622459038

the dog again shook his head as if to say no	40.1609325985515
then said the prisoner lets think who it can be	140.3072669619182
can it be can it possibly be the illustrious coxcomb mazarin de piscina hey	94.69634388908085

gentlemen you see said the duke to those present who dared not even smile that i	58.71379755639728
let us go on to another of his exercises	35.72894387042238
gentlementhere was a profound silence in the room when the duke again addressed 	50.7806202922597
monsieur de chavigny be so good as to lend me your cane	30.345672566351414
monsieur de chavigny handed his cane to monsieur de beaufort	16.025911430935224
monsieur de beaufort placed it horizontally at the height of one foot	51.94372807482876
now pistache my good dog jump the height of this cane for madame de montbazon	97.43453508534577
but interposed monsieur de chavigny it seems to me that pistache is only doing w	32.204147579858336
stop said the duke pistache jump for the queen	62.394683537210234
and he raised his cane six inches higher	61.63715994620645
the dog sprang and in spite of the height jumped lightly over it	103.65464414001696
and now said the duke raising it still six inches higher jump for the king	77.80940820747269
the dog obeyed and jumped quickly over the cane	124.18845769069492
now then said the duke and as he spoke lowered the cane almost level with the gr	55.1868414051882
the dog turned his back to the cane	69.88043014421856
what asked the duke what do you mean and he gave him the cane again first making	59.19475607908966
jump then monsieur pistache	63.53417496319137
but pistache as at first turned round on his legs and stood with his back to the	48.82110080334037
monsieur de beaufort made the experiment a third time but by this time pistaches	34.286694920211765
monsieur de beaufort took the pieces out of his mouth and presented them with gr	27.645903407638514
three days afterward pistache was found deadpoisoned	79.1243601543543
then the duke said openly that his dog had been killed by a drug with which they	83.18775317842943
this fresh impertinence reached the ears of the cardinal and alarmed him greatly	105.42270789867844
the donjon of vincennes was considered very unhealthy and madame de rambouillet 	34.95759653439876
so it was ordered the prisoner was henceforth to eat nothing that had not previo	78.9323243677275
every kind of revenge was practiced upon the duke by the governor in return for 	120.08798676091864
de chavigny who according to report was a son of richelieus and had been a creat	28.186196671830814
he took from the duke all the steel knives and silver forks and replaced them wi	79.57658980195329
a fortnight afterward the duke going to the tennis court found two rows of trees	150.40639792594683
one morning the gardener went to him and told him as if to please him that he wa	28.035833436578585
now since as every one knows asparagus takes four years in coming to perfection 	287.8208554293404
at last his patience was exhausted	100.55107407767883
he assembled his keepers and notwithstanding his wellknown difficulty of utteran	227.3098073535658
gentlemen will you permit a grandson of henry iv	28.657770916557002
to be overwhelmed with insults and ignominy	101.44065362919056
odds fish as my grandfather used to say i once reigned in paris do you know that	97.95922634408255
the queen at that time liked me and called me the most honest man in the kingdom	74.82879067618765
gentlemen and citizens set me free i shall go to the louvre and strangle mazarin	67.74923444171117
you shall be my bodyguard	61.937972574698364
i will make you all captains with good pensions odds fish on march forward	233.29214016676502
but eloquent as he might be the eloquence of the grandson of henry iv	41.83585224767647
did not touch those hearts of stone not one man stirred so monsieur de beaufort 	133.11188990567467
sometimes when monsieur de chavigny paid him a visit the duke used to ask him wh	59.668983810223374
my lord answered de chavigny with a low bow i have on the ramparts twenty pieces	41.61073840691563
i should bombard the troops till not one grain of gunpowder was unexploded	193.26465080235042
yes but after you had fired off your thirty thousand guns they would take the do	178.0035023942942
and in his turn the duke bowed low to monsieur de chavigny	25.32101331593615
for myself on the other hand my lord returned the governor when the first rebel 	51.82074867885971
and once more he bowed low before his highness	245.24549549715616
these bittersweet pleasantries lasted ten minutes sometimes longer but always fi	548.2425906276521
monsieur de chavigny turning toward the door used to call out halloo la ramee	55.93137965271727
la ramee came into the room	10.814909110688975
la ramee i recommend monsieur le duc to you particularly treat him as a man of h	37.566392660460124
la ramee became therefore the dukes dinner guest by compulsionan eternal keeper 	465.6982993650291
now although la ramee appreciated as of a certain value the honor of being shut 	144.26907961508303
hardly compensated for the loss of that which he had experienced in going from t	62.331730113882536
one may be a jailer or a keeper and at the same time a good father and husband	44.78657785327242
la ramee adored his wife and children whom now he could only catch a glimpse of 	59.46297508110693
twas too brief an enjoyment and la ramee felt that the gayety of heart he had re	97.13625218023907
he accepted therefore with delight an offer made to him by his friend the stewar	92.2697083193677
we consider it useless to draw a physical or moral portrait of grimaud if as we 	104.79306045298459
but grimaud had for twelve or fifteen years preserved habitual silence and a hab	105.04741217388063
chapter xviii	2.6267274960966263
grimaud begins his functions	195.0711851334296
grimaud thereupon presented himself with his smooth exterior at the donjon of vi	72.50611493625313
now monsieur de chavigny piqued himself on his infallible penetration for that w	78.25169693765241
he addressed about twelve words to him grimaud answered in four	250.39432038172998
heres a promising fellow and it is i who have found out his merits said monsieur	116.40397994551344
go he added and make yourself agreeable to monsieur la ramee and tell him that y	66.94154338350818
grimaud had every quality that could attract a man on duty who wishes to have a 	123.92114114823319
so after a thousand questions which met with only a word in reply la ramee fasci	105.39410845339063
my orders asked grimaud	104.83344336585651
they are these never to leave the prisoner alone to keep away from him every poi	91.80643630091947
those are all asked grimaud	35.86106157291531
all now replied la ramee	35.23426722345618
good answered grimaud and he went right to the prisoner	43.7333818074484
the duke was in the act of combing his beard which he had allowed to grow as wel	43.63860032218955
but having some days previously seen from the top of the donjon madame de montba	47.58993586014614
the comb was to be a leaden one because his beard like that of most fair people 	205.70266477689853
as grimaud entered he saw this comb on the teatable he took it up and as he took	40.34574447163443
the duke looked at this strange figure with surprise	47.71773060152535
the figure put the comb in its pocket	115.86162412396246
ho hey what s that cried the duke	53.96216524289082
who is this creature	45.81545313838134
grimaud did not answer but bowed a second time	62.615954577208385
art thou dumb cried the duke	44.30534260686001
grimaud made a sign that he was not	7.544738402622809
what art thou then answer i command thee said the duke	161.22768435046868
a keeper replied grimaud	74.37207986223666
a keeper reiterated the duke there was nothing wanting in my collection except t	120.4104053669059
halloo la ramee some one	77.1661289871994
la ramee ran in haste to obey the call	63.31584805795103
who is this wretch who takes my comb and puts it in his pocket asked the duke	51.03252472179725
one of your guards my prince a man of talent and merit whom you will like as i a	92.5717613669147
why does he take my comb	58.75468729184601
why do you take my lords comb asked la ramee	39.959071609701894
grimaud drew the comb from his pocket and passing his fingers over the largest t	34.87382658427545
true said la ramee	16.962513341525405
what does the animal say asked the duke	41.78673701307373
that the king has forbidden your lordship to have any pointed instrument	160.6708117066833
are you mad la ramee you yourself gave me this comb	93.11616584941191
i was very wrong my lord for in giving it to you i acted in opposition to my ord	62.4898139551085
the duke looked furiously at grimaud	40.54460921811989
i perceive that this creature will be my particular aversion he muttered	168.30145401280862
grimaud nevertheless was resolved for certain reasons not at once to come to a f	116.44672721478607
a fresh practical joke now occurred to the duke	244.3995947721692
he had asked for crawfish for his breakfast on the following morning he intended	80.06247399044466
the day was employed in preparations for the execution	97.28254238711361
every one grows childish in prison but the character of monsieur de beaufort was	50.41238232443187
in the course of his mornings walk he collected two or three small branches from	89.59528332691019
when he came home he formed his handkerchief into a loop	111.93265716690641
nothing of all this escaped grimaud but la ramee looked on with the curiosity of	63.021444394963
the guards looked on it with indifference	105.73247010911214
when everything was ready the gallows hung in the middle of the room the loop ma	74.20774710613432
who has taken my piece of glass asked the duke frowning	72.83583024445751
grimaud made a sign to denote that he had done so	15.657922819581998
what thou again why didst thou take it	341.4769179435617
yeswhy asked la ramee	75.36344692116388
grimaud who held the piece of glass in his hand said sharp	69.2055822491178
true my lord exclaimed la ramee	11.013709718489562
ah deuce take it we have a precious fellow here	124.84781412656505
monsieur grimaud said the duke for your sake i beg of you never come within the 	29.205177869074717
hush hush cried la ramee give me your gibbet my lord	25.73218169238243
i will shape it out for you with my knife	71.10687295050744
and he took the gibbet and shaped it out as neatly as possible	42.158798093777186
that s it said the duke now make me a little hole in the floor whilst i go and f	42.23107958825993
la ramee knelt down and made a hole in the floor meanwhile the duke hung the cra	52.91094867404317
then he placed the gibbet in the middle of the room bursting with laughter	29.67381443175695
la ramee laughed also and the guards laughed in chorus grimaud however did not e	123.82852233609029
he approached la ramee and showing him the crawfish hung up by the thread	86.82700859880244
cardinal he said	17.580096940019164
hung by order of his highness the duc de beaufort cried the prisoner laughing vi	35.25889770541439
la ramee uttered a cry of horror and rushed toward the gibbet which he broke at 	28.660203405814638
he was going to throw the crawfish out also when grimaud snatched it from his ha	88.86409948032063
good to eat he said and put it in his pocket	39.00540022141695
this scene so enchanted the duke that at the moment he forgave grimaud for his p	47.8140754068645
but the story of the crab made a great noise through the interior of the donjon 	36.28192921040714
monsieur de chavigny who at heart detested the cardinal took pains to tell the s	67.05003225112965
the prisoner happened to remark among the guards one man with a very good counte	151.43743903143206
one morning he took this man on one side and had succeeded in speaking to him wh	54.946189411207676
go away he said	19.647729383593994
the guard obeyed	560.3052218091539
you are insupportable cried the duke i shall beat you	39.29011900742498
grimaud bowed	78.22867800754035
i will break every bone in your body cried the duke	86.70255961949326
grimaud bowed but stepped back	104.34370398745986
spy cried the duke more and more enraged i will strangle you with my own hands	57.89866704510053
and he extended his hands toward grimaud who merely thrust the guard out and shu	90.11131179857824
at the same time he felt the dukes arms on his shoulders like two iron claws but	32.54101417683632
hush smiling as he uttered the word	124.70769477381867
a gesture a smile and a word from grimaud all at once were so unusual that his h	98.5160988099172
grimaud took advantage of that instant to draw from his vest a charming little n	51.01664912351041
the duke more and more bewildered let grimaud loose and took the note	242.63032809759903
from madame de montbazon he cried	12.26491753708567
grimaud nodded assent	7407.058492669017
the duke tore open the note passed his hands over his eyes for he was dazzled an	118.66254886396945
my dear dukeyou may entirely confide in the brave lad who will give you this not	125.62485362995545
the moment of your deliverance is at hand have patience and courage and remember	126.73583892907361
yours wholly and most affectionately	3579.7807387498488
marie de montbazon	18.125327271892644
i sign my full name for i should be vain if i could suppose that after five year	161.1328431373753
the poor duke became perfectly giddy	408.04202927897336
what for five years he had been wantinga faithful servant a friend a helping han	108.94343474125239
oh dearest marie she thinks of me then after five years of separation heavens th	122.05700406815059
and thou my brave fellow thou consentest thus to aid me	182.62487350078658
grimaud signified his assent	391.3036481734694
and you have come here with that purpose	40.62890236965054
grimaud repeated the sign	121.776679727031
and i was ready to strangle you cried the duke	32.08340654340772
grimaud smiled	82.10649781942027
wait then said the duke fumbling in his pocket	20.536532078519013
wait he continued renewing his fruitless search it shall not be said that such d	96.20465791494142
went without recompense	2545.0852415325107
the dukes endeavors evinced the best intention in the world but one of the preca	39.657060502710785
whereupon grimaud observing the dukes disappointment drew from his pocket a purs	43.22893271142659
here is what you are looking for he said	24.860719368394907
the duke opened the purse and wanted to empty it into grimauds hands but grimaud	69.0228071805974
thank you monseigneur he said drawing back i am paid	77.97219815597308
the duke went from one surprise to another	128.56104214217854
he held out his hand	27.784263652573973
grimaud drew near and kissed it respectfully	127.84860205589725
the grand manner of athos had left its mark on grimaud	87.42992305165055
what shall we do and when and how proceed	157.23884588460191
it is now eleven answered grimaud	34.78052082559883
let my lord at two oclock ask leave to make up a game at tennis with la ramee an	73.37996625164735
and then	39.71806363034927
your highness will approach the walls and call out to a man who works in the moa	63.77745763732495
i understand said the duke	34.930403176508584
grimaud made a sign that he was going away	13.610489706966378
ah cried the duke will you not accept any money from me	31.627181468328782
i wish my lord would make me one promise	100.4002996334804
what speak	4465.815992149259
tis this when we escape together that i shall go everywhere and be always first 	190.13340618494038
true on my honor as a gentleman it shall be as thou dost suggest	42.38190516276931
now resumed grimaud i ve only one thing more to askthat your highness will conti	65.82726604580692
ill try said the duke	43.87999915968416
at this moment la ramee after the interview we have described with the cardinal 	36.3158801573804
the duke had thrown himself as he was wo nt to do in moments of dullness and vex	39.52220700840713
la ramee cast an inquiring look around him and observing the same signs of antip	34.58396155174154
then turning to grimaud	10.299497896957797
very good my friend very good	39.9178981531922
you have been spoken of in a promising quarter and you will soon i hope have new	87.11157679129694
grimaud saluted in his politest manner and withdrew as was his custom on the ent	44.32958125411454
well my lord said la ramee with his rude laugh you still set yourself against th	36.16780419879285
so tis you la ramee in faith tis time you came back again	238.38271538001794
i threw myself on the bed and turned my nose to the wall that i might nt break m	68.61543657304297
i doubt however said la ramee in sprightly allusion to the silence of his subord	61.84029106005886
pardieu you are righta mute from the east i swear it was time for you to come ba	60.14967805804382
monseigneur is too good said la ramee flattered by the compliment	45.26901421666234
yes continued the duke really i feel bored today beyond the power of description	168.1399834656941
then let us have a match in the tennis court exclaimed la ramee	48.91581295620952
if you wish it	12.747802403712145
i am at your service my lord	9.428715475219214
i protest my dear la ramee said the duke that you are a charming fellow and that	26.14400473395107
my lord replied la ramee i think if it depended on the cardinal your wishes woul	30.40668121715942
what do you mean have you seen him lately	21.653615199446484
he sent for me today	64.18734716195247
really to speak to you about me	31.58781437719676
of what else do you imagine he would speak to me really my lord you are his nigh	39.11693152784971
the duke smiled with bitterness	107.40586197440271
ah la ramee if you would but accept my offers i would make your fortune	87.3772846409291
how you would no sooner have left prison than your goods would be confiscated	147.7653431011077
i shall no sooner be out of prison than i shall be master of paris	47.69949708600986
pshaw pshaw i can not hear such things said as that this is a fine conversation 	94.44030207147799
very well let us say no more about it	22.382458721206927
so you and the cardinal have been talking about me la ramee some day when he sen	84.58069031162177
monseigneur i see well that i must call grimaud	61.29289956253808
well i am wrong	35.837027189850915
and what did the cuistre pettifogger say about me	84.99659675385107
i admit the word monseigneur because it rhymes with ministre minister	387.27426929058055
what did he say to me he told me to watch you	26.207710899431643
and why so why watch me asked the duke uneasily	93.6978555013637
because an astrologer had predicted that you would escape	61.74732715903027
ah an astrologer predicted that said the duke starting in spite of himself	56.935401837465655
oh mon dieu yes those imbeciles of magicians can only imagine things to torment 	107.82099237325687
and what did you reply to his most illustrious eminence	68.52712108684186
that if the astrologer in question made almanacs i would advise him not to buy o	173.09202261409334
why not	52.44438500752499
because before you could escape you would have to be turned into a bird	91.8602974602561
unfortunately that is true	17.774209273438412
let us go and have a game at tennis la ramee	19.631902544536516
my lordi beg your highnesss pardonbut i must beg for half an hours leave of abse	115.95784930937292
because monseigneur mazarin is a prouder man than his highness though not of suc	53.19419074988321
well shall i send for some breakfast here	111.24152933218895
no my lord i must tell you that the confectioner who lived opposite the castleda	30.54197458831768

i bought said he the business of my predecessor on the strength of his assurance	111.71792770796638
but i then replied probably monsieur de chavigny is afraid your pastry is not go	95.98027523071441
my pastry not good well monsieur la ramee you shall judge of it yourself and at 	85.53547628495545

la ramee went out but in five minutes one of the officers of the guard entered i	37.843115624966565
but during these five minutes the duke had had time to read again the note from 	108.56461272925196
but his confidence in grimaud whose petty persecutions he now perceived were onl	182.6675488257334
chapter xix	2.260578693541442
pts made by the successor of father marteau are described	68.81209362824276
in half an hour la ramee returned full of glee like most men who have eaten and 	69.2021503557243
the pates were excellent the wine delicious	973.1316635137081
the weather was fine and the game at tennis took place in the open air	157.36425795815737
at two oclock the tennis balls began according to grimauds directions to take th	64.04515214942026
la ramee then proposed to send some one to pick them up but the duke remarked th	69.51674172520717
hey friend cried the duke	40.53919629013265
the man raised his head and the duke was about to utter a cry of surprise	32.87875485871972
the peasant the gardener was rochefort whom he believed to be in the bastile	64.1565333999451
well who s up there said the man	148.88842398957016
be so good as to collect and throw us back our balls said the duke	48.98023199809945
the gardener nodded and began to fling up the balls which were picked up by la r	62.87184821046523
one however fell at the dukes feet and seeing that it was intended for him he pu	42.01352420897095
la ramee was in ecstasies at having beaten a prince of the blood	64.2166446611424
the duke went indoors and retired to bed where he spent indeed the greater part 	142.21415304925645
la ramee carried off all his clothes in order to be certain that the duke would 	42.74210124029844
however the duke contrived to hide the ball under his bolster and as soon as the	48.07939735578561
my lordyour friends are watching over you and the hour of your deliverance is at	85.11380785526853

do not open the pie till you are alone	73.47902059076407
i hope you will be satisfied with its contents	38.53475436858493
your highnesss most devoted servant	1502.383148262207
in the bastile as elsewhere	71.76048858580393
comte de rochefort	1.1807004489693633
the duke who had latterly been allowed a fire burned the letter but kept the bal	90.27465372844782
la ramee entered he smiled kindly on the prisoner for he was an excellent man an	53.35562959411893
he endeavored to cheer him up in his solitude	140.6753849593118
ah my friend cried the duke you are so good if i could but do as you do and eat 	31.65651255457605

in any case said the duke his cellar and kitchen might easily excel those of mon	201.94007615062142
well my lord said la ramee falling into the trap what is there to prevent your t	29.272790703581638
you are right said the duke	8.53263521452172
if i am to remain here permanently as monsieur mazarin has kindly given me to un	44.14076777589319
my lord said la ramee if you will take a bit of good advice do nt put that off t	37.7709863919861
good said the duc de beaufort to himself every man in order that he may lose his	40.413375798222766
let us then take advantage of it	23.877627272541265
then aloud	4834.831562374081
well my dear la ramee the day after tomorrow is a holiday	43.12713099195541
yes my lordpentecost	37.45161136060154
will you give me a lesson the day after tomorrow	25.540833430606305
in what	61.21844587937968
in gastronomy	3727.416658606535
willingly my lord	12.022574935523533
but teteatete	7783.16778199607
send the guards to take their meal in the canteen of monsieur de chavigny well h	32.346945130228924
hum said la ramee	7.934131580404867
the proposal was seductive but la ramee was an old stager acquainted with all th	80.53957236266226
monsieur de beaufort had said that he had forty ways of getting out of prison	34.7279872160803
did this proposed breakfast cover some stratagem he reflected but he remembered 	416.1651402819125
as to getting him drunk the duke could nt hope to do that and he laughed at the 	115.22862536276634
then an idea came to him which harmonized everything	179.01796639440806
the duke had followed with anxiety la ramees unspoken soliloquy reading it from 	159.15932712790425
but presently the exempts face suddenly brightened	1565.1242926112702
well he asked that will do will it not	121.62005595847695
yes my lord on one condition	67.78112732896935
that grimaud shall wait on us at table	138.34676415242856
nothing could be more agreeable to the duke however he had presence of mind enou	96.47965169083466
to the devil with your grimaud he will spoil the feast	97.53461570534465
i will direct him to stand behind your chair and since he does nt speak your hig	101.8543871287468
do you know my friend i find one thing very evident in all this you distrust me	58.45993992314691
my lord the day after tomorrow is pentecost	47.056527519408576
well what is pentecost to me are you afraid that the holy spirit will come as a 	64.38310079502706
no my lord but i have already told you what that damned magician predicted	51.31146071992779
and what was it	17.720252165939595
that the day of pentecost would not pass without your highness being out of vinc	60.013108139610665
you believe in sorcerers then you fool	300.64702695790737
ii mind them no more than that and he snapped his fingers but it is my lord giul	69.9704563658324
the duke shrugged his shoulders	34.56672459398454
well then with well acted goodhumor i allow grimaud but no one else you must man	269.7478003346847
order whatever you like for supperthe only thing i specify is one of those pies 	228.28719371532807
then you think you will some day leave it said la ramee	55.893520844047565
the devil replied the prince surely at the death of mazarin	61.67885031864811
i am fifteen years younger than he is	63.312647855828345
at vincennes tis true one lives faster	162.82587982661352
my lord replied la ramee my lord	11.961526971669619
or dies sooner for it comes to the same thing	76.09039598117742
la ramee was going out	21.47027593895032
he stopped however at the door for an instant	35.037098302226035
whom does your highness wish me to send to you	27.14987732832971
any one except grimaud	107.26056066081425
the officer of the guard then with his chessboard	90.68352675195428
five minutes afterward the officer entered and the duke seemed to be immersed in	30.468241107674274
a strange thing is the mind and it is wonderful what revolutions may be wrought 	144.32976767669214
the duke had been five years in prison and now to him looking back upon them tho	64.96967557417089
besides there was one thing that engaged his most anxious thoughtin what way was	158.26894487956403
and what friends awaited him without he had friends then after five years in pri	129.4772107160981
he forgot that besides his friends of his own sex a woman strange to say had rem	89.27160668989355
it is true that she had not perhaps been scrupulously faithful to him but she ha	54.0175413740847
so the duke had more than enough to think about accordingly he fared at chess as	128.3449480965857
but his successive defeats did service to the duke in one waythey killed time fo	250.73973605205728
so at least the duke believed but sleep is a capricious fairy and it is precisel	87.96564617754788
the duke waited until midnight turning on his mattress like st	243.38142426773933
laurence on his gridiron	81.40265291875761
finally he slept	236.83187067214726
but at daybreak he awoke	69.30742847869534
wild dreams had disturbed his repose	367.45871261980403
he dreamed that he was endowed with wingshe wished to fly away	74.62098729726267
for a time these wings supported him but when he reached a certain height this n	126.88803848896035
his wings were broken and he seemed to sink into a bottomless abyss whence he aw	68.17353153472324
he fell asleep again and another vision appeared	237.65860447193091
he was in a subterranean passage by which he was to leave vincennes	39.77599303679988
grimaud was walking before him with a lantern	84.03175660811387
by degrees the passage narrowed yet the duke continued his course	184.61088296879916
at last it became so narrow that the fugitive tried in vain to proceed	87.34162690457845
the sides of the walls seem to close in even to press against him	171.17678578313343
he made fruitless efforts to go on it was impossible	108.5031819256248
nevertheless he still saw grimaud with his lantern in front advancing	97.61310648464479
he wished to call out to him but could not utter a word	64.24638442225927
then at the other extremity he heard the footsteps of those who were pursuing hi	57.63060615369356
these steps came on came fast	1067.4798185009827
he was discovered all hope of flight was gone	179.2733820606089
still the walls seemed to be closing on him they appeared to be in concert with 	74.65259085661843
at last he heard the voice of la ramee	17.05095065932079
la ramee took his hand and laughed aloud	29.4407500353075
he was captured again and conducted to the low and vaulted chamber in which orna	79.20230980870872
their three graves were there rising above the ground and a fourth was also ther	85.91768138232977
the duke was obliged to make as many efforts to awake as he had done to go to sl	42.747818499336226
in fact said one of the guards who had remained in the chamber and had been kept	31.77089730304908
what is the matter with your highness asked la ramee	14.144658381800266
tis your fault you simpleton answered the duke	118.6339214651438
with your idle nonsense yesterday about escaping you worried me so that i dreame	194.17822381192786
la ramee laughed	20.83610159269705
come he said tis a warning from heaven	128.11516578941746
never commit such an imprudence as to try to escape except in your dreams	175.7811926234054
and you are right my dear la ramee said the duke wiping away the sweat that stoo	26.025382291083996
hush said la ramee and one by one he sent away the guards on various pretexts	82.6288664893777
well asked the duke when they were alone	35.80072413994864
well replied la ramee your supper is ordered	65.65109666080099
ah and what is it to be monsieur my majordomo will there be a pie	64.89264314850836
i should think so indeedalmost as high as a tower	118.68212809762596
you told him it was for me	34.94421382464941
yes and he said he would do his best to please your highness	49.28425722080526
good exclaimed the duke rubbing his hands	40.2836044077167
devil take it my lord what a gourmand you are growing i have nt seen you with so	78.55200960802274
the duke saw that he had not controlled himself as he ought but at that moment a	31.688205269091096
la ramee drew near to grimaud who spoke to him in a low voice	15.200288838990009
the duke meanwhile recovered his selfcontrol	275.5801094045187
i have already forbidden that man he said to come in here without my permission	75.14609604054051
you must pardon him my lord said la ramee for i directed him to come	36.47335287994494
and why did you so direct when you know that he displeases me	48.62076036407568
my lord will remember that it was agreed between us that he should wait upon us 	68.27112434102041
my lord has forgotten the supper	68.77761668462774
no but i have forgotten monsieur grimaud	31.91412483280327
my lord understands that there can be no supper unless he is allowed to be prese	71.73010937411955
go on then have it your own way	61.73984898322284
come here my lad said la ramee and hear what i have to say	38.00002554817326
grimaud approached with a very sullen expression on his face	57.9728149884369
la ramee continued my lord has done me the honor to invite me to a supper tomorr	46.65295382728515
grimaud made a sign which meant that he did nt see what that had to do with him	21.79270746064416
yes yes said la ramee the matter concerns you for you will have the honor to ser	27.299849499757247
grimaud bowed in thanks	305.48056451818906
and now said la ramee i must ask your highnesss pardon but it seems that monsieu	28.65671189164676
the duke tried to exchange a glance with grimaud but there was no glance in grim	107.2749335993988
go then said the duke and return as soon as possible	20.785135671355984
does your highness wish to take revenge for the game of tennis yesterday	42.39034337174183
grimaud intimated by a scarcely perceptible nod that he should consent	272.0315169173198
yes said the duke but take care my dear la ramee for i propose to beat you badly	51.92239422227525
la ramee went out	6.721011260370295
grimaud looked after him and when the door was closed he drew out of his pocket 	20.850403579054866
write my lord he said	8.432676106406218
and what	19.64776685869951
grimaud dictated	5726.253591848619
all is ready for tomorrow evening	122.4820299515633

what next	280.90692212270835
sign your name my lord	32.32957440614553
the duke signed	475.63099546614444
now my lord give me if you have not lost it the ballthat which contained the let	65.36356670586832
the duke took it from under his pillow and gave it to grimaud	34.16447434158069
grimaud gave a grim smile	72.3352808591951
well asked the duke	19.95020467678065
well my lord i sew up the paper in the ball and you in your game of tennis will 	60.5835820687228
but will it not be lost	50.75441530721425
oh no there will be some one at hand to pick it up	82.79889680583405
a gardener	263.2180531477862
grimaud nodded	1003.0775605694245
the same as yesterday	496.28765315498345
another nod on the part of grimaud	68.08886915200236
the count de rochefort	12.635812251955254
grimaud nodded the third time	185.17698548508028
come now said the duke give some particulars of the plan for our escape	62.92046398269177
that is forbidden me said grimaud until the last moment	40.954237003457436
who will be waiting for me beyond the ditch	61.221715384417536
i know nothing about it my lord	25.379512911528565
but at least if you do nt want to see me turn crazy tell what that famous pate w	110.34337214590511
two poniards a knotted rope and a poire dangoisse	116.17131068883977
this poire dangoisse was a famous gag in the form of a pear which being thrust i	82.17269040180565
yes i understand	13.38971283720723
my lord observes that there will be enough to go around	87.49160406663782
we shall take to ourselves the poniards and the rope replied the duke	50.59087089693047
and make la ramee eat the pear answered grimaud	191.96521911391113
my dear grimaud thou speakest seldom but when thou dost one must do thee justice	175.30833620928354

in half an hour	30.34942774921651
the young man bowed	11.75995344373769

no do nt be alarmed although it is to a lady that i am going to present you and 	33.018922390914256
the young man looked at the count with a certain uneasiness but at a smile from 	23.42975880082789
how old is she inquired the vicomte de bragelonne	39.413400892293204
my dear raoul learn once for all that that is a question which is never asked	74.00025694061779
when you can find out a womans age by her face it is useless to ask it when you 	72.40478141590678
is she beautiful	740.8393457263134

he retired to his toilet	86.102690289031
when he reappeared athos received him with the same paternal smile as that which	67.762836360317
athos cast a glance at his feet hands and hairthose three marks of race	90.85397087226121

the two travelers proceeded to the rue saint dominique and stopped at the door o	18.1971918844507

athos bowed and obeyed	63.60534852857302
the footman was withdrawing but athos stopped him by a sign	88.02988786118509
madame he said to the duchess i have had the boldness to present myself at your 	33.644780578505944
i have now the boldness to ask you for an interview of half an hour	46.94891325808599
i grant it monsieur replied madame de chevreuse with her most gracious smile	30.60750794468756
but that is not all madame	31.073462537527256
oh i am very presuming i am aware	31.31451672927039
the interview for which i ask is of us two alone and i very earnestly wish that 	239.06411443522782
i am not at home to any one said the duchess de chevreuse to the footman	24.514020384461098
you may go	48.36951558280129
the footman went out	82.28483020761031
there ensued a brief silence during which these two persons who at first sight r	70.10203611256375
the duchess was the first to speak	55.73011622625258
well sir i am waiting with impatience to hear what you wish to say to me	27.909312617343343
and i madame replied athos am looking with admiration	70.19144413399728
sir said madame de chevreuse you must excuse me but i long to know to whom i am 	26.106071990955886
you belong to the court doubtless yet i have never seen you at court	89.80645208307824
have you by any chance been in the bastile	50.87573744626661
no madame i have not but very likely i am on the road to it	43.06377685238241
ah then tell me who you are and get along with you upon your journey replied the	77.47006956451561
who i am madame my name has been mentioned to youthe comte de la fere you do not	40.09482304306252
i once bore another which you knew but you have certainly forgotten it	226.99991567285053
tell it me sir	145.05849701797018
formerly said the count i was athos	22.806386915815068
madame de chevreuse looked astonished	36.395503200982965
the name was not wholly forgotten but mixed up and confused with ancient recolle	139.7800551060019
athos said she wait a moment	113.94521622255226
and she placed her hands on her brow as if to force the fugitive ideas it contai	52.723470182178836
shall i help you madame asked athos	27.274262421846316
yes do said the duchess	54.278333240169324
this athos was connected with three young musketeers named porthos dartagnan and	47.835112597900626
he stopped short	646.6872501223138
and aramis said the duchess quickly	40.53102993631928
and aramis i see you have not forgotten the name	31.825110700918557
no she said poor aramis a charming man elegant discreet and a writer of poetical	65.1773556423236
i am afraid he has turned out ill she added	108.42255181313786
he has he is an abb	96.73402650834504
ah what a misfortune exclaimed the duchess playing carelessly with her fan	90.32791772037709
indeed sir i thank you you have recalled one of the most agreeable recollections	46.72929728444118
will you permit me then to recall another to you	32.25742363847258
relating to him	14.630247960166406
yes and no	69.55228564240818
faith said madame de chevreuse say on	29.526614800043
with a man like you i fear nothing	83.73504639180598
athos bowed	106.77195568987653
aramis he continued was intimate with a young needlewoman from tours a cousin of	104.11518131226796
ah i knew her cried the duchess	77.99491847085366
it was to her he wrote from the siege of rochelle to warn her of a plot against 	75.79837386478408
exactly so will you allow me to speak to you of her	38.31104074876277
if replied the duchess with a meaning look you do not say too much against her	68.97046302948812
i should be ungrateful said athos and i regard ingratitude not as a fault or a c	104.17651216334795
you ungrateful to marie michon monsieur said madame de chevreuse trying to read 	39.310461101799554
but how can that be you never knew her	95.62067304311869
eh madame who knows said athos	65.27800487110139
there is a popular proverb to the effect that it is only mountains that never me	89.22079494096207
oh go on monsieur go on said madame de chevreuse eagerly you ca nt imagine how m	46.12992660092594
you encourage me said athos i will continue then	42.30800375077125
that cousin of aramis that marie michon that needlewoman notwithstanding her low	305.75934780886166
alas said madame de chevreuse with a slight sigh and a little movement of her ey	17.076092505095453
and the queen had reason for her affection for marie was devoted to herdevoted t	70.16721611690258
which interrupted the duchess is now brought up against her as a great crime	236.7244983645519
and therefore continued athos the cardinalthe true cardinal the other onedetermi	222.26685039319756
fortunately the affair was not managed so secretly but that it became known to t	71.09273538764084
the case had been provided for if marie michon should be threatened with any dan	93.18692390789154
that is true monsieur you are well informed	42.0578619319645
one morning the green book was brought to her by the prince de marsillac	44.53207928029424
there was no time to lose	16.416476322495438
happily marie and a follower of hers named kitty could disguise themselves admir	127.40100480634705
the prince procured for marie michon the dress of a cavalier and for kitty that 	92.15630818513266
why really it was all exactly as you say cried madame de chevreuse clapping her 	49.73482438014175
it would indeed be strange if she checked herself	95.57827863819487
if i should follow the two fugitives to the end of their journey said athos	27.80765722026694
no madame i will not thus waste your time	103.3218479812363
we will accompany them only to a little village in limousin lying between tulle 	83.26561627253096
madame de chevreuse uttered a cry of surprise and looked at athos with an expres	7.945552082473958
wait madame continued athos what remains for me to tell you is even more strange	111.73391022884869
monsieur said madame de chevreuse i believe you are a sorcerer i am prepared for	15.98532789814058
but reallyno matter go on	258.82504816677357
the journey of that day had been long and wearing it was a cold day the eleventh	59.318346577800824
marie michon was a very aristocratic person like her sister the queen she had be	72.70719677852536
athos paused	964.3885689437724
oh continue said the duchess	98.44542508651939
i have told you that i am prepared for anything	16.988120166575918
the two travelers knocked at the door	30.04286882017484
it was late the priest who had gone to bed cried out to them to come in	78.75269535220563
they entered for the door was not lockedthere is much confidence among villagers	281.7139033441189
a lamp burned in the chamber occupied by the priest	74.2247692485574
marie michon who made the most charming cavalier in the world pushed open the do	142.44626269273508
willingly my young cavalier said the priest if you will be content with the rema	27.93419672494561
the two travelers consulted for a moment	45.02632867231521
the priest heard a burst of laughter and then the master or rather the mistress 	77.13482221790616
sup then and make as little noise as possible said the priest for i too have bee	119.58564648596416
madame de chevreuse evidently went from surprise to astonishment and from astoni	97.88717839789541
her face as she looked at athos had taken on an expression that can not be descr	33.94358651287863
it could be seen that she had wished to speak but she had remained silent throug	31.9290189642425
what happened then she asked	148.24206780487268
then said athos	7.415136245737577
ah i have come now to what is most difficult	67.43219084107037
speak speak one can say anything to me	116.81700763369278
besides it does nt concern me it relates to mademoiselle marie michon	40.18376615528373
ah that is true said athos	6.5031221075813415
well then marie michon had supper with her follower and then in accordance with 	86.86415444490108
really monsieur said madame de chevreuse unless you are the devil in person i do	29.92371654491479
a charming woman was that marie michon resumed athos one of those wild creatures	58.66655776903516
now thinking that her host was a priest that coquette took it into her head that	108.18746908474988
count said the duchess upon my word you frighten me	24.938957545942433
alas continued athos the poor abb was not a st	27.08206648745711
ambroise and i repeat marie michon was an adorable creature	62.47750881362694
monsieur cried the duchess seizing athoss hands tell me this moment how you know	80.54506435919906
athos laughed	2558.40515886739
nothing is easier madame	116.77763246942507
a cavalier charged with an important mission had come an hour before your arriva	149.21237354121914
the priest having all confidence in his guest who besides was a nobleman had lef	95.41598630163176
and therefore marie came seeking hospitality from the guest of the good abb and 	207.40925292102438
and that cavalier that guest that nobleman who arrived before she came	817.813278494696
it was i the comte de la fere said athos rising and bowing respectfully to the d	19.73348562796035
the duchess remained a moment stupefied then suddenly bursting into laughter	327.84362299430956
ah upon my word said she it is very droll and that mad marie michon fared better	55.757707063304935
sit down dear count and go on with your story	60.50958606097361
at this point i have to accuse myself of a fault madame	123.67332858222689
i have told you that i was traveling on an important mission	36.569682883225866
at daybreak i left the chamber without noise leaving my charming companion aslee	194.87241571985905
in the front room the follower was also still asleep her head leaning back on th	95.62596226623896
her pretty face arrested my attention i approached and recognized that little ki	366.61618070396617
in that way i discovered that the charming traveler was	72.3524944897661
marie michon said madame de chevreuse hastily	21.623568941480936
marie michon continued athos	34.19920787407292
then i went out of the house i proceeded to the stable and found my horse saddle	46.49396722063573
we set forth on our journey	48.13394640777489
and have you never revisited that village eagerly asked madame de chevreuse	79.42877940100396
a year after madame	92.574145047007
i wanted to see the good cur again	114.01782865542714
i found him much preoccupied with an event that he could not at all comprehend	91.58628489851931
a week before he had received in a cradle a beautiful little boy three months ol	72.02761171006459
it was the date of that strange adventure interrupted madame de chevreuse	31.680069517418104
yes but he could nt understand what it meant for he had spent that night with a 	74.8654441891744
you must know monsieur that marie michon when she returned to france in 1643 imm	41.080673775998996
and what said the abb asked athos	32.86330016944023
that a nobleman whom he did not know had wished to take charge of it had answere	56.8631501591784
that was true	65.02986651233167
ah i see that nobleman was you it was his father	106.02711449784393

you have kept the secret you have brought him to see me thinking to make me happ	44.30963148046709
oh thanks sir thanks cried madame de chevreuse seizing his hand and trying to pu	35.82115555758874
i bring him to you madame said athos withdrawing his hand hoping that in your tu	48.50722107934512
tomorrow i plunge into an adventurous affair in which i may be killed	87.08354312827905
then it will devolve on you to push him on in that world where he is called on t	62.77326261083873
rest assured cried the duchess i shall do what i can	31.42764326248282
i have but little influence now but all that i have shall most assuredly be his	144.8465098807276
as to his title and fortune	167.21267580531855
as to that madame i have made over to him the estate of bragelonne my inheritanc	40.86598528348639
upon my soul monsieur said the duchess you are a true nobleman but i am eager to	21.084168954962852
where is he	11.618679085145212
there in the salon	54.722919179848745
i will have him come in if you really wish it	98.51877648609212
athos moved toward the door the duchess held him back	68.13255168067452
is he handsome she asked	148.15656080998752
athos smiled	149.2339335499575
he resembles his mother	139.32582597471915
so he opened the door and beckoned the young man in	21.32891873452882
the duchess could not restrain a cry of joy on seeing so handsome a young cavali	42.12564138459126
vicomte come here said athos the duchess permits you to kiss her hand	64.63992811264622
the youth approached with his charming smile and his head bare and kneeling down	126.30833788694599
sir he said turning to athos was it not in compassion to my timidity that you to	41.85281224004726
no vicomte said madame de chevreuse taking his hand and making him sit near her 	42.559521687080434

but let us see whatever i may be she added hardly restraining herself from kissi	116.38061437308974
athos standing looked at them both with indescribable pleasure	114.49781767946061
madame answered the youth in his sweet voice it seems to me that there is only o	29.407680011051124
i have been brought up by monsieur le comte with the intention i believe of maki	34.125341614271456
yes i understand it well	20.52056658709342
personally i am on bad terms with him on account of the quarrels between madame 	63.467620435733835
but the prince de marsillac yes indeed that s the right thing	61.868871290815925
the prince de marsillacmy old friendwill recommend our young friend to madame de	109.93498911627178
well that will do charmingly said the count but may i beg that the greatest hast	104.33086799857959
do you wish it known that you are interested about him monsieur le comte	56.29892333352704
better for him in future that he should be supposed never to have seen me	76.04302548966804

ah murmured athos kissing her hand had i only sooner known that marie michon was	64.72412893019653
chapter xxi	2.8971752203358507
the abb scarron	19.192315672393438
there was once in the rue des tournelles a house known by all the sedan chairmen	41.820773605675264
there was neither dining nor playing at cards nor dancing in that house	252.81912512400712
nevertheless it was the rendezvous of the great world and all paris went there	56.72709013722463
it was the abode of the little abb scarron	23.973659335134787
in the home of the witty abb dwelt incessant laughter there all the items of the	102.76304305874952
the diminutive abb scarron who however was an abb only because he owned an abbey	209.1146431112763
on a day of the carnival he had taken a notion to provide an unusual entertainme	62.757968903232815
he had made his valet cover him with honey then opening a feather bed he had rol	112.90392407422047
he then began to visit his friends of both sexes in that strange costume	76.02072877292998
at first he had been followed through astonishment then with derisive shouts the	115.54433314403977
as soon as he took to flight every one pursued him until pressed on all sides sc	96.55941145011442
scarron was heated the cold seized on him and when he reached the farther bank h	85.80844627519511
every means had been employed in vain to restore the use of his limbs	47.79612414933386
he had been subjected to a severe disciplinary course of medicine at length he s	84.3000885562706
there he had a chair made on his own plan and one day visiting anne of austria i	59.37205617277627
yes your majesty there is a title which i covet much replied scarron	78.87558686851659
and what is that	9.84529095418372
that of being your invalid answered scarron	205.41037816927374
so he was called the queens invalid with a pension of fifteen hundred francs	60.95640400920176
from that lucky moment scarron led a happy life spending both income and princip	221.32347106207447
one day however an emissary of the cardinals gave him to understand that he was 	48.01919689740905
and why asked scarron is he not a man of good birth	18.281227783255783
he has unfortunately too much wit	276.49925275321533
well then why do you wish me to give up seeing such a man	36.222239488832784
because he is an enemy	25.998008116004677
of whom	63.10477066103054
of the cardinal	28.068986918315748
what answered scarron i continue to receive monsieur gilles despreaux who thinks	69.8710674059066
the conversation had rested there and scarron through sheer obstinacy had seen m	270.73668270819076
now the very morning of which we speak was that of his quarterday payment and sc	66.69105646849921
it was on thursday the abbs reception day people went there in crowds	234.42365158800996
the cardinals refusal to pay the pension was known about the town in half an hou	134.94543480472353
in the rue saint honore athos fell in with two gentlemen whom he did not know on	43.28645074331453
one of them hat in hand said to him	77.24896368997646
would you believe it monsieur that contemptible mazarin has stopped poor scarron	107.0646977746495
that is unreasonable said athos saluting in his turn the two cavaliers	34.659390693565214
and they separated with courteous gestures	478.23790521450195
it happens well that we are going there this evening said athos to the vicomte w	31.238739451519145
what then is this monsieur scarron who thus puts all paris in commotion is he so	84.53952216226368
oh no not at all vicomte athos replied he is simply a gentleman of great genius 	68.14626305200649
do gentlemen then make verses asked raoul naively i thought it was derogatory	175.43945987572272
so it is my dear vicomte said athos laughing to make bad ones but to make good o	49.72075127438761
nevertheless he continued in the tone of one who gives wholesome advice i think 	87.95016972760493
then said raoul this monsieur scarron is a poet	38.82333089200674
yes you are warned vicomte	333.3819996398126
consider well what you do in that house	61.22734985191773
talk only by gestures or rather always listen	416.2872006251754
yes monsieur replied raoul	16.076940047494524
you will see me talking with one of my friends the abb dherblay of whom you have	36.66309412487876
i remember him monsieur	178.48830941853848
come near to us from time to time as if to speak but do not speak and do not lis	64.34759039665562
that little stratagem may serve to keep off interlopers	201.25611567633095
very well monsieur i will obey you at all points	28.672437309857294
athos made two visits in paris at seven oclock he and raoul directed their steps	62.97752519261702
athos forced his way through and entered followed by the young man	55.46624995541198
the first person that struck him on his entrance was aramis planted near a great	114.30846887705128
this was the abb scarron always laughing joking complimentingyet sufferingand to	286.77381111030195
around this kind of rolling tent pressed a crowd of gentlemen and ladies	217.05283027600154
the room was neatly comfortably furnished	317.1558251791139
large valances of silk embroidered with flowers of gay colors which were rather 	55.33917908024001
two well trained servingmen were in attendance on the company	166.1150192020481
on perceiving athos aramis advanced toward him took him by the hand and presente	44.46538907598683
raoul remained silent for he was not prepared for the dignity of the bel esprit	43.42253086598825
after some minutes the door opened and a footman announced mademoiselle paulet	49.36962637409821
athos touched the shoulder of the vicomte	74.48905903513645
look at this lady raoul she is an historic personage it was to visit her king he	80.54709994953966
was going when he was assassinated	45.254758942920226
every one thronged around mademoiselle paulet for she was always very much the f	124.24200200510023
she was a tall woman with a slender figure and a forest of golden curls such as 	58.27383084194314
this fawncolored hair or perhaps the sort of ascendancy which she had over other	229.36172676942883
mademoiselle paulet took her accustomed seat but before sitting down she cast in	126.96708253949856
athos smiled	139.28942395042856
mademoiselle paulet has observed you vicomte go and bow to her do nt try to appe	77.49423248945428
when shall we two walk together athos then said to aramis	62.26456469257073
presentlythere are not a sufficient number of people here yet we shall be remark	141.1794473360763
at this moment the door opened and in walked the coadjutor	23.43153524472649
at this name every one looked around for his was already a very celebrated name	147.5997844429531
athos did the same	50.42905577888042
he knew the abb de gondy only by report	104.39561131257753
he saw a little dark man ill made and awkward with his hands in everythingexcept	126.97337912839818
scarron turned around toward him and came to meet him in his chair	22.796666797911676
well said the coadjutor on seeing him you are in disgrace then abb	114.40684095344143
this was the orthodox phrase	67.70792849297129
it had been said that evening a hundred timesand scarron was at his hundredth bo	44.95872678737533
monsieur the cardinal mazarin has been so kind as to think of me he said	34.455464509749945
but how can you continue to receive us asked the coadjutor if your income is les	55.9151932081361
oh no cried scarron i should compromise you too much	27.703591221435257
perhaps you have resources of which we are ignorant	85.69514109477417
i shall borrow from the queen	74.49381875346323
but her majesty has no property interposed aramis	97.50634286151214
at this moment the door opened and madame de chevreuse was announced	6.242074982812436
every one arose	274.25870671262925
scarron turned his chair toward the door raoul blushed athos made a sign to aram	21.43264399763962
in the midst of all the compliments that awaited her on her entrance the duchess	97.7813272731181
apropos she said as if to drive away thoughts that pursued her in spite of herse	81.23184872422586
what is monsieur voiture ill inquired a gentleman who had spoken to athos in the	32.99169537964683
he was acting but forgot to take the precaution to have a change of linen ready 	96.32037569583795
is he then so ill dear voiture asked aramis half hidden by the window curtain	90.00652981711845

you do nt like him my dear parthenie said scarron	11.072794857146363
what an injustice my dear invalid i hate him so little that i should be delighte	64.38423671447586
you are not called lionne for nothing observed madame de chevreuse your teeth ar	73.71942005201865
you are unjust to a great poet it seems to me raoul ventured to say	61.492726266075046
a great poet come one may easily see vicomte that you are lately from the provin	191.44380632816512
a great poet he is scarcely five feet high	111.1974053985712
bravo bravo cried a tall man with an enormous mustache and a long rapier bravo f	66.42072684730485
for my part i always thought his poetry detestable and i think i know something 	68.7887025324334
who is this officer inquired raoul of athos who is speaking	22.49965284177811
monsieur de scudery the author of clelie and of le grand cyrus which were compos	30.02232583655336
raoul turned and saw two faces just arrived	234.64922415438585
one was perfectly charming delicate pensive shaded by beautiful dark hair and ey	119.53992287978443
the other of mature age seemed to have the former one under her charge and was c	144.2995580701543
raoul resolved not to quit the room without having spoken to the beautiful girl 	103.62415254555158
meantime aramis had drawn near to the coadjutor who smiling all the while contri	89.25590047261102
aramis notwithstanding his selfcontrol could not refrain from a slight movement 	63.994263683787956
laugh then said monsieur de retz they are looking at us	28.9986423099835
and leaving aramis he went to talk with madame de chevreuse who was in the midst	24.234622380450165
aramis affected a laugh to divert the attention of certain curious listeners and	169.16549477949937
as soon as the two friends met they began a conversation which was emphasized by	38.15162768871762
raoul then approached them as athos had directed him to do	80.355366077944
tis a rondeau by monsieur voiture that monsieur labb is repeating to me	106.18092125952312
said athos in a loud voice and i confess i think it incomparable	21.366648732073347
raoul stayed only a few minutes near them and then mingled with the group round 	101.18861744820522
well then asked athos in a low tone	7.61307324882089
it is to be tomorrow said aramis hastily	35.57175057843305
at what time	30.994455285245273

who told you	21.44261581064813
the count de rochefort	13.150194108569849
some one drew near	347.8043901459384
and then philosophic ideas are wholly wanting in voitures works but i am of the 	105.72319375667648
aramis spoke so as to be heard by everybody	112.0019576088152
and i too murmured the young lady with the velvet eyes	37.52183352191663
i have the misfortune also to admire his poetry exceedingly	229.79117974350848
monsieur scarron do me the honor said raoul blushing to tell me the name of that	31.64127781762163
ah my young vicomte replied scarron i suppose you wish to propose to her an alli	36.84899889200767
raoul blushed again	390.83279668423774
you asked the name of that young lady	63.60322550645025
she is called the fair indian	44.365244815006655
excuse me sir returned raoul blushing still more deeply i know no more than i di	39.416285842193915
alas i am from the country	73.57031497968478

you forgive me then sir said raoul and you will deign to tell me who is the pers	25.52602828007349
certainly one of the most charming persons that livesmademoiselle frances daubig	35.60280446185658
does she belong to the family of the celebrated agrippa the friend of henry iv	23.12002553313922
his granddaughter	206.79697571196735
she comes from martinique so i call her the beautiful indian	94.94909556823644
raoul looked surprised and his eyes met those of the young lady who smiled	78.30768693403698
the company went on speaking of the poet voiture	111.50594964527941
monsieur said mademoiselle daubigne to scarron as if she wished to join in the c	32.091798901230554
scarron and raoul laughed	53.04037213074597
the fair indian astonished at the sensation her observation produced looked down	267.033524477118
athos still within the inclosure of the window watched this scene with a smile o	74.8892232494609
tell the comte de la fere to come to me said madame de chevreuse i want to speak	12.633296970977591
and i said the coadjutor want it to be thought that i do not speak to him	31.48904031528131
i admire i love himfor i know his former adventuresbut i shall not speak to him 	98.88809877242332
and why day after tomorrow asked madame de chevreuse	47.014149443785584
you will know that tomorrow evening said the coadjutor smiling	49.727496857576185
really my dear gondy said the duchess you remind one of the apocalypse	19.220917439179523
monsieur dherblay she added turning toward aramis will you be my servant once mo	104.3134573593637
how can you doubt it replied aramis this evening tomorrow always command me	77.44185208032093
i will then	72.6375791178967
go and look for the comte de la fere i wish to speak with him	16.370641033165448
aramis found athos and brought him	79.337856707217
monsieur le comte said the duchess giving him a letter here is what i promised y	32.8972677258392
madame he is very happy in owing any obligation to you	65.91420784754503
you have no reason to envy him on that score for i owe to you the pleasure of kn	29.97492087157828
as she uttered that bon mot she arose and asked for her carriage	204.1241622053213
mademoiselle paulet had already gone mademoiselle de scudery was going	40.86862577873783
vicomte said athos to raoul follow the duchess beg her to do you the favor to ta	72.59796599984551
the fair indian approached scarron	122.04408406008397
you are going already he said	41.6134766303899
one of the last as you see if you hear anything of monsieur voiture be so kind a	48.16510242429291
oh said scarron he may die now	45.763346094927854
why asked the young girl with the velvet eyes	19.9789641558704
certainly his panegyric has been uttered	119.30718633364899
they parted laughing she turning back to gaze at the poor paralytic man with int	140.71543697260387
one by one the several groups broke up	287.95524835731374
scarron seemed not to observe that certain of his guests had talked mysteriously	128.57305802934286
what was all that to scarron at his house rebellion could be planned with impuni	63.51884731193878
as to raoul he had attended the duchess to her carriage where as she took her se	57.028952324804585
vicomte may my good wishes and this kiss bring you good fortune	432.4315951560857
then she had pushed him away and directed the coachman to stop at the hotel de l	35.11524037078549
the carriage had started madame de chevreuse had made a parting gesture to the y	32.77600658337347
athos surmised what had taken place and smiled	266.3656160894315
come vicomte he said it is time for you to go to bed you will start in the morni	30.923330311996978
sleep well your last night as citizen	665.0823259745424
i am to be a soldier then said the young man	16.359392363235152
oh monsieur i thank you with all my heart	29.47442644985433
adieu count said the abb dherblay i return to my convent	35.679400906927015

adieu gentlemen said the count i am going to sleep twentyfour hours i am just fa	27.613749999368583
the three men saluted one another whilst exchanging a last look	216.65348551743506
scarron followed their movements with a glance from the corner of his eye	50.53274230048983
not one of them will do as he says he murmured with his little monkey smile but 	37.08019077874207
alas i have only my tongue but i will try to show that it is good for something	47.657823912519646
ho there champenois here it is eleven oclock	76.18311851820968
come and roll me to bed	191.6624734381702
really that demoiselle daubigne is very charming	54.697300947550424
so the invalid disappeared soon afterward and went into his sleepingroom and one	234.65470680242848

saint denis	1.7819083189117757
the day had begun to break when athos arose and dressed himself	65.05827664598878
it was plain by a paleness still greater than usual and by those traces which lo	98.00463956979496
contrary to the custom of a man so firm and decided there was this morning in hi	61.49340067616064
he was occupied with the preparations for raouls departure and was seeking to ga	58.03122766366845
in the first place he himself furbished a sword which he drew from its perfumed 	43.55693062367656
then he placed at the bottom of the valise belonging to the young man a small ba	28.253397141398157
at length after occupying about an hour in these preparations he opened the door	60.08580938261603
the sun already high penetrated into the room through the window the curtains of	100.96339391690026
he was still sleeping his head gracefully reposing on his arm	111.88665853461404
athos approached and hung over the youth in an attitude full of tender melanchol	113.90137767412905
by degrees athos gave himself up to the charms of his reverie in the proximity o	36.89877590357892
his own youth seemed to reappear bringing with it all those savoury remembrances	122.86898225642584
between the past and the present was an ineffable abyss	100.52892523980037
but imagination has the wings of an angel of light and travels safely through or	302.42548227324556
he remembered that all the first part of his life had been embittered by a woman	28.090543972905515
in recalling all he had been through he foresaw all that raoul might suffer and 	119.49803442896552
at this moment raoul awoke without a cloud on his face without weariness or lass	44.08326015169804
you are there sir he said respectfully	37.39154847009383
yes raoul replied the count	16.476186935494137
and you did not awaken me	21.59316281108164
i wished to leave you still to enjoy some moments of sleep my child you must be 	96.79954814566769
oh sir how good you are	44.28214129650129
athos smiled	80.69937720606188
how do you feel this morning he inquired	31.103592650837697
perfectly well quite rested sir	1411.5528617931102
you are still growing athos continued with that charming and paternal interest f	106.22239615374885
oh sir i beg your pardon exclaimed raoul ashamed of so much attention in an inst	43.59557914737631
athos then called olivain	112.88524425481982
everything said olivain to athos has been done according to your directions the 	44.426340165704545
and i was asleep cried raoul whilst you sir you had the kindness to attend to al	51.960288589887334
truly sir you overwhelm me with benefits	95.8388680547925
therefore you love me a little i hope replied athos in a tone of emotion	26.361515062337862
oh sir god knows how much i love revere you	88.41876972329732
see that you forget nothing said athos appearing to look about him that he might	40.02876504992481
no indeed sir answered raoul	29.852778109725755
the servant then approached athos and said hesitatingly	156.9512712303141
monsieur le vicomte has no sword	49.53685188331796
tis well said athos i will take care of that	11.835688353951337
they went downstairs raoul looking every now and then at the count to see if the	65.45229920628852
when they reached the steps raoul saw three horses	32.80633269658975
oh sir then you are going with me	25.28844052155357
i will accompany you a portion of the way said athos	24.353448087701196
joy shone in raouls eyes and he leaped lightly to his saddle	88.0513821567348
athos mounted more slowly after speaking in a low voice to the lackey who instea	74.54249899887688
raoul delighted at the counts companionship perceived or affected to perceive no	230.63259331098695
they set out passing over the pont neuf they pursued their way along the quay th	53.890667145345745
they proceeded to the rue saint denis	13.118794498132228
after passing through the porte saint denis athos looked at raouls way of riding	44.163463307502695
take care raoul i have already often told you of this you must not forget it for	48.56941134396046
see your horse is tired already he froths at the mouth whilst mine looks as if h	181.1141823538468
you hold the bit too tight and so make his mouth hard so that you will not be ab	126.45194399821563
the safety of a cavalier often depends on the prompt obedience of his horse	141.72396591050497
in a week remember you will no longer be performing your manoeuvres for practice	121.559062661991
then suddenly in order not to give too uncomfortable an importance to this obser	159.85648553224215
see raoul he resumed what a fine plain for partridge shooting	173.79078189598926
the young man stored in his mind the admonition whilst he admired the delicate t	54.00264267430621
i have remarked also another thing said athos which is that in firing off your p	128.68296965557715
this tension lessens the accuracy of the aim	111.32022154496052
so in twelve times you thrice missed the mark	238.7914808074934
which you sir struck twelve times answered raoul smiling	354.02198524544855
because i bent my arm and rested my hand on my elbowso do you understand what i 	61.127407809919234
yes sir	26.15272645825379
i have fired since in that manner and have been quite successful	123.07251131137741
what a cold wind resumed athos a wintry blast	210.7729400904196
apropos if you fireand you will do so for you are recommended to a young general	69.71461903278495
he who fires the first shot rarely hits his man for he fires with the apprehensi	192.6548065863756
i shall do so if only in gratitude	113.12023187761584
eh cried athos are not those fellows poachers they have arrested yonder they are	129.54940436376594
then another important thing raoul should you be wounded in a battle and fall fr	152.34691261916947
at all events should you be wounded write to me that very instant or get some on	244.60443925590985
we are judges of wounds we old soldiers athos added smiling	331.5748287183087
thank you sir answered the young man much moved	20.67163230927869
they arrived that very moment at the gate of the town guarded by two sentinels	45.03255546855107
here comes a young gentleman said one of them who seems as if he were going to j	37.70658139188715
how do you make that out inquired athos	27.747285028101352
by his manner sir and his age he s the second today	190.1706721951566
has a young man such as i am gone through this morning then asked raoul	58.34384085124302
faith yes with a haughty presence a fine equipage such as the son of a noble hou	115.62033528081186
he will be my companion on the journey sir cried raoul	36.35053886600836
alas he can not make me forget what i shall have lost	40.284305532077916
thus talking they traversed the streets full of people on account of the fete an	144.85030868143923
let us alight raoul said athos	15.185057423916899
olivain take care of our horses and give me my sword	32.261046194117
the two gentlemen then went into the church	54.60958034278798
athos gave raoul some of the holy water	108.01870238076042
a love as tender as that of a lover for his mistress dwells undoubtedly in some 	131.40967589601414
athos said a word to one of the vergers who bowed and proceeded toward the basem	39.44830698186307
come raoul he said let us follow this man	35.86218163298478
the verger opened the iron grating that guarded the royal tombs and stood on the	103.52127876769663
the sepulchral depths of the descent were dimly lighted by a silver lamp on the 	50.46714770798967
the young man prepared for this scene by the state of his own feelings which wer	34.98821436768263
there was profound silence	529.9604350471784

athos smiled	80.63529421435433
yours is a noble nature	47.196582239862565
he said here is your sword	57.956314112581
raoul bent his knee to the ground	27.508337105669554
it was worn by my father a loyal gentleman	71.29176716854174

one of the forty methods of escape of the duc de beaufort	13.255702451645568

in his escape alone apart from his plans for the future which it must be admitte	61.24995132048829
in the first place his escape would be a serious misfortune to monsieur de chavi	36.29369550688335
it would be a still worse affair for mazarin whom he execrated for the greater o	68.90485044992054
it may be observed that there was a proper proportion in his sentiments toward t	69.54455860004903
then monsieur de beaufort who was so familiar with the interior of the palais ro	21.68185766787791
it is true that on coming to himself he found that he was still within four wall	93.46117952541381
the only thing that was pleasant to him in that odious tableausuch is the instab	60.79866230517187
grimaud seemed to him an antinous	73.55975633839633
it is needless to say that this transformation was visible only to the prisoners	46.04763433378917
grimaud was still the same and therefore he retained the entire confidence of hi	91.86292564204392
and so the good la ramee made a festivity of the little supper with his prisoner	72.52741540804767
he had but one faulthe was a gourmand he had found the pates good the wine excel	180.82070332218754
now the successor of pere marteau had promised him a pate of pheasant instead of	49.793590289882
all this set off by the presence of that excellent prince who was so goodnatured	75.16103965821341
he therefore looked forward to six oclock with as much impatience as the duke hi	172.4468006848539
since daybreak la ramee had been occupied with the preparations and trusting no 	56.925873365637436
the latter had surpassed himself he showed la ramee a monstrous pate ornamented 	119.0809784547997
it was empty as yet but a pheasant and two partridges were lying near it	122.37233801539668
la ramees mouth watered and he returned to the dukes chamber rubbing his hands	69.74713780007284
to crown his happiness monsieur de chavigny had started on a journey that mornin	91.32375798057986
as for grimaud he seemed more sullen than ever	47.548222369237415
in the course of the forenoon monsieur de beaufort had a game of tennis with la 	40.70863411397268
grimaud going in advance followed the course which they were to take in the even	126.2741929384383
the game was played in an inclosure called the little court of the chateau a pla	54.530619476201515
there were three gates to open before reaching the inclosure each by a different	228.46709437224328
when they arrived grimaud went carelessly and sat down by a loophole in the wall	40.12644828178245
it was evident that there the rope ladder was to be attached	70.88614652217636
this manoeuvre transparent to the duc de beaufort was quite unintelligible to la	70.11066087504572
the game at tennis which upon a sign from grimaud monsieur de beaufort had conse	62.3364858289049
the duke was in full strength and beat la ramee completely	140.39600934491725
four of the guards who were constantly near the prisoner assisted in picking up 	72.00285290289108
when the game was over the duke laughing at la ramee for his bad play offered th	121.1428426899156
the guards asked permission of la ramee who gave it to them but not till the eve	115.7761331266616
six oclock came and although they were not to sit down to table until seven oclo	44.65574018606882
upon a sideboard appeared the colossal pie with the dukes arms on it and seeming	136.25659199604667
the rest of the dinner was to come	57.77026568707162
every one was impatient la ramee to sit down to table the guards to go and drink	49.33420946903635
grimaud alone was calm as ever	190.10738777814464
one might have fancied that athos had educated him with the express forethought 	129.04569283687655
there were moments when looking at grimaud the duke asked himself if he was not 	71.27728695517432
la ramee sent away the guards desiring them to drink to the dukes health and as 	65.2044310604587
whenever my lord pleases	71.18941509098508
the prince looked at grimaud grimaud looked at the clock it was hardly a quarter	29.718759193200427
the escape was fixed to take place at seven oclock there was therefore threequar	55.56451323946959
the duke in order to pass away another quarter of an hour pretended to be readin	58.82844474476611
la ramee went up to him and looked over his shoulder to see what sort of a book 	22.77473022786609
it was caesars commentaries which la ramee had lent him contrary to the orders o	71.8563288998274
meantime he uncorked the bottles and went to smell if the pie was good	101.64149373821718
at halfpast six the duke arose and said very gravely	327.60515320567515
certainly caesar was the greatest man of ancient times	74.5617311260785
you think so my lord answered la ramee	22.120730016867395
well as for me i prefer hannibal	26.04305373689241
and why pray master la ramee asked the duke	98.2420461090885
because he left no commentaries replied la ramee with his coarse laugh	71.1628744565589
the duke vouchsafed no reply but sitting down at the table made a sign that la r	67.13298678280604
there is nothing so expressive as the face of an epicure who finds himself befor	37.711076634598285
the duke smiled	82.80367421612384
zounds he said i do nt suppose there is a more contented man at this moment in a	41.61247457843185
you are right my lord duke answered the officer i do nt know any pleasanter sigh	36.23467754285805
you will my lord duke easily comprehend that the honor fairly doubles the pleasu	157.7249238758665
the duke in his turn bowed and an imperceptible smile appeared on the face of gr	26.03569693596229
my dear la ramee said the duke you are the only man to turn such faultless compl	36.23467754285805
no my lord duke replied la ramee in the fullness of his heart i say what i think	21.0778260149601
then you are attached to me asked the duke	21.69591770824662
to own the truth i should be inconsolable if you were to leave vincennes	75.80889234756383
a droll way of showing your affliction	686.6080144510462
the duke meant to say affection	304.4775667765389
but my lord returned la ramee what would you do if you got out every folly you c	83.7480639255502
now monsieur de chavigny is not amiable i allow but monsieur du tremblay is cons	30.73915070440481
indeed exclaimed the duke who from time to time looked at the clock the fingers 	91.94312131803525
but what can you expect from the brother of a capuchin monk brought up in the sc	50.187907286885675
in short answered the duke if i comprehend you aright la ramee i am ungrateful f	91.54698876171935
oh my lord duke tis the height of ingratitude but your highness has never seriou	73.69253355469783
yes returned the duke i must confess i sometimes think of it	57.33017912244096
still by one of your forty methods your highness	72.3782708475513
yes yes indeed	42.94797502462377
my lord said la ramee now we are quite at our ease and enjoying ourselves pray t	49.58584244971969
willingly answered the duke give me the pie	35.519427611989165
i am listening said la ramee leaning back in his armchair and raising his glass 	35.147420814238984
the duke glanced at the clock	33.16032786323547
in ten minutes it would strike seven	132.189604466618
grimaud placed the pie before the duke who took a knife with a silver blade to r	63.12379084894982
thank you la ramee said the prisoner	23.017093705359063
well my lord this famous invention of yours	96.97288655439228
must i tell you replied the duke on what i most reckon and what i determine to t	52.45386368054072
yes that s the thing my lord cried his custodian gaily	54.50401269142662
well i should hope in the first instance to have for keeper an honest fellow lik	108.01190362702592
and you have me my lord	22.202194077911766
having then a keeper like la ramee i should try also to have introduced to him b	88.94634250153358
come come said la ramee that s not a bad idea	18.100824141960278
capital is nt it for instance the former servingman of some brave gentleman an e	175.44389370258378
hush do nt let us talk politics my lord	39.799556619645706
then my keeper would begin to trust this man and to depend upon him and i should	110.71562418468437
ah yes but how can the news be brought to you	31.873541850363893
nothing easier in a game of tennis for example	119.21102394967869
in a game of tennis asked la ramee giving more serious attention to the dukes wo	52.767723470529916
yes see i send a ball into the moat a man is there who picks it up the ball cont	68.50245493751626
instead of returning the ball to me when i call for it from the top of the wall 	40.09789171207456
thus we have exchanged ideas and no one has seen us do it	98.37752280897685
the devil it does the devil it does said la ramee scratching his head you are in	45.12323131329153
i shall have to watch the men who pick up balls	121.39814561213178
the duke smiled	66.55915027436556
but resumed la ramee that is only a way of corresponding	69.55401024972944
and that is a great deal it seems to me	15.367669957041379
but not enough	356.99228007444333
pardon me for instance i say to my friends be on a certain day on a certain hour	42.60891538862412
well what then la ramee began to be uneasy unless the horses have wings to mount	154.3134200311709
that s not needed	197.7852516046197
i have replied the duke a way of descending from the ramparts	76.46025102503553
a rope ladder	824.485723626185
yes but answered la ramee trying to laugh a ladder of ropes ca nt be sent around	54.30713452163393
no but it may be sent in something else	80.96706701323615
in something elsein something else in what	482.6377888655831
in a pate for example	172.275602625042
in a pate said la ramee	20.152105475651826
let us suppose one thing replied the duke let us suppose for instance that my ma	65.94429355035722
well said la ramee shuddering	26.62249777896982
well la ramee who is a gourmand sees his pates thinks them more attractive than 	158.8871797979148
i consent on condition that la ramee tries them with me	183.59308694013507
that we may be more at our ease la ramee removes the guards keeping only grimaud	81.27938969499291
grimaud is the man whom a friend has sent to second me in everything	92.5801045157728
the moment for my escape is fixedseven oclock	305.2397304452395
well at a few minutes to seven	27.224192199041234
at a few minutes to seven cried la ramee cold sweat upon his brow	64.86220215867075
at a few minutes to seven returned the duke suiting the action to the words i ra	48.75227632415214
i point one of the poniards at la ramees breast and i say to him my friend i am 	65.65854764559164
the duke in pronouncing these words suited as we have said the action to the wor	34.00443396139005
he was standing near the officer and he directed the point of the poniard in suc	38.70895418828468
meanwhile grimaud still mute as ever drew from the pie the other poniard the rop	92.37474639515466
la ramee followed all these objects with his eyes his alarm every moment increas	83.35662816008885
oh my lord he cried with an expression of stupefaction in his face you have nt t	22.27092407993329
no not if thou dost not oppose my flight	143.4585088525958
but my lord if i allow you to escape i am a ruined man	36.08537543003069
i will compensate thee for the loss of thy place	137.4862487333081
you are determined to leave the chateau	47.688103255819215
by heaven and earth this night i am determined to be free	89.11713344660166
and if i defend myself or call or cry out	196.352407312046
i will kill thee on the honor of a gentleman	37.4865674668451
at this moment the clock struck	5.6253805761423825
seven oclock said grimaud who had not spoken a word	17.84496254733391
la ramee made one movement in order to satisfy his conscience	36.89038418251881
the duke frowned the officer felt the point of the poniard which having penetrat	69.85294524250249
let us dispatch said the duke	30.905213533096138
my lord one last favor	443.22206126090845
what speak make haste	5382.848103732229
bind my arms my lord fast	50.31026218745014
why bind thee	13615.651530993324
that i may not be considered as your accomplice	51.55417270551961
your hands asked grimaud	106.7176455112229
not before me behind me	382.565868845933
but with what asked the duke	66.22266182249889
with your belt my lord replied la ramee	27.754099797140828
the duke undid his belt and gave it to grimaud who tied la ramee in such a way a	49.518832329603974
your feet too said grimaud	151.67924988394975
la ramee stretched out his legs grimaud took a tablecloth tore it into strips an	52.29699863823374
now my lord said the poor man let me have the poire dangoisse	30.529743657359766
i ask for it without it i should be tried in a court of justice because i did no	62.959990100154556
thrust it into my mouth my lord thrust it in	50.89594957542427
grimaud prepared to comply with this request when the officer made a sign as if 	69.2481320576493
speak said the duke	12.796255802260152
now my lord do not forget if any harm happens to me on your account that i have 	25.47825020972593
rest assured put the gag in grimaud	116.04668389602153
in a second la ramee was gagged and laid prostrate	67.48652111664866
two or three chairs were thrown down as if there had been a struggle	24.889465391417456
grimaud then took from the pocket of the officer all the keys it contained and f	47.308993761848704
at last they reached the tennis court	71.34771016365622
it was completely deserted	258.92577636088737
no sentinels no one at any of the windows	136.88534488151052
the duke ran to the rampart and perceived on the other side of the ditch three c	40.38713776311554
the duke exchanged a signal with them	135.25065553538587
it was indeed for him that they were there	27.20271628102011
grimaud meantime undid the means of escape	188.4808680040578
this was not however a rope ladder but a ball of silk cord with a narrow board w	85.11299615061382
go said the duke	14.661447558536516
first my lord inquired grimaud	42.523738190801794
if i am caught i risk nothing but being taken back again to prison	158.51675086972352
if they catch thee thou wilt be hung	122.12540977473738
true replied grimaud	5.948189549986959
and instantly grimaud sitting upon the board as if on horseback commenced his pe	132.7078025877795
the duke followed him with his eyes with involuntary terror	47.36657598494074
he had gone down about threequarters of the length of the wall when the cord bro	36.320097033511956
grimaud fellprecipitated into the moat	222.56762744390534
the duke uttered a cry but grimaud did not give a single moan	42.382016313884755
he must have been dreadfully hurt for he did not stir from the place where he fe	37.92231670744894
immediately one of the men who were waiting slipped down into the moat tied unde	45.582823316291325
descend my lord said the man in the moat	16.152871188991185
there are only fifteen feet more from the top down here and the grass is soft	90.44894408186678
the duke had already begun to descend	46.081021410787265
his task was the more difficult as there was no board to support him	141.0868459400845
he was obliged to let himself down by his hands and from a height of fifty feet	61.26855852925863
but as we have said he was active strong and full of presence of mind	49.57430533846064
in less than five minutes he arrived at the end of the cord	21.514118057631027
he was then only fifteen feet from the ground as the gentlemen below had told hi	152.54077919738734
he let go the rope and fell upon his feet without receiving any injury	146.4061182215318
he instantly began to climb up the slope of the moat on the top of which he met 	33.68953843434071
the other two gentlemen were unknown to him	75.02053664901443
grimaud in a swoon was tied securely to a horse	141.40137236314158
gentlemen said the duke i will thank you later now we have not a moment to lose	29.000986188020253
on then on those who love me follow me	271.2353278704576

chapter xxiv	2.196009601204727
the timely arrival of dartagnan in paris	40.271015059726906
at blois dartagnan received the money paid to him by mazarin for any future serv	59.435874685330106
from blois to paris was a journey of four days for ordinary travelers but dartag	59.080211980698515
in turning the corner of the rue montmartre in order to reach the rue tiquetonne	14.467279937507282
dartagnan and planchet had hardly turned the corner when porthos recognized them	80.59758367874963
eh dartagnan he cried	17.395456295694284
thank god you have come	64.73996351898533
eh goodday dear friend replied dartagnan	33.1575924868264
porthos came down at once to the threshold of the hotel	35.95665743062867
ah my dear friend he cried what bad stabling for my horses here	75.89374417236286
indeed said dartagnan i am most unhappy to hear it on account of those fine anim	34.1641403799504
and i alsoi was also wretchedly off he answered moving backward and forward as h	253.1366212687097
the pretty madeleine who had approached during this colloquy stepped back and tu	118.68620279507817
but to her great surprise dartagnan remained perfectly calm and instead of being	203.2683515253315
yes i understand the air of la rue tiquetonne is not like that of pierrefonds bu	30.590961918664156
when will you do that	42.413868060813215
immediately i hope	48.57442567785151
ah so much the better	16.485448373432188
to that exclamation of porthoss succeeded a groaning low and profound which seem	236.48001582561093
dartagnan who had just dismounted then saw outlined against the wall the enormou	67.11167050697016
and you too my poor monsieur mouston are out of place in this poor hotel are you	108.90276683214269
he finds the cooking detestable replied porthos	295.27826596325235
why then does nt he attend to it himself as at chantilly	117.35717620761935
ah monsieur i have not here as i had there the ponds of monsieur le prince where	69.75282515455453
as for the cellar i have searched every part and poor stuff i found	206.29517530022468
monsieur mouston said dartagnan i should indeed condole with you had i not at th	31.642990322111554
then taking porthos aside	191.24827709056026
my dear du vallon he said here you are in full dress most fortunately for i am g	40.19094263280208
gracious me really exclaimed porthos opening his great wondering eyes	165.57600152303996
yes my friend	11.855463435383578
a presentation indeed	1748.29837920801
does that alarm you	70.72209686178242
no but it agitates me	62.33526714235484
oh do nt be distressed you have to deal with a cardinal of another kind	80.45305566081312
this one will not oppress you by his dignity	172.09464484144846
tis the same thingyou understand me dartagnana court	246.73081393809161
there s no court now	191.14215639612522
the queen	43.60167045456144
i was going to say there s no longer a queen	45.61793980407102
the queen rest assured we shall not see her	148.64957381957078
and you say that we are going from here to the palais royal	19.324252850480594
only that there may be no delay i shall borrow one of your horses	57.41498698332973
certainly all the four are at your service	60.270893754969265
oh i need only one of them for the time being	46.3164698305684
shall we take our valets	56.37333427469867
yes you may as well take mousqueton	62.47426161385946
as to planchet he has certain reasons for not going to court	113.82145785903157
and what are they	23.04026895820141
oh he does nt stand well with his eminence	83.95609946960516
mouston said porthos saddle vulcan and bayard	62.68541202414337
and for myself monsieur shall i saddle rustaud	446.1756801684291
no take a more stylish horse phoebus or superbe we are going with some ceremony	119.57395736692301
ah said mousqueton breathing more freely you are only going then to make a visit	42.79976744596003
oh yes of course mouston nothing else	199.46971157141894
but to avoid risk put the pistols in the holsters	179.11786828890857
you will find mine on my saddle already loaded	323.0654452053842
mouston breathed a sigh he could nt understand visits of ceremony made under arm	213.09685656810709
indeed said porthos looking complacently at his old lackey as he went away you a	41.263342615383245
dartagnan smiled	111.73875871214184
but you my friendare you not going to change your dress	157.60463520102311
no i shall go as i am	18.89266724764321
this traveling dress will serve to show the cardinal my haste to obey his comman	232.11815980433065
they set out on vulcan and bayard followed by mousqueton on phoebus and arrived 	27.999634801460292
the streets were crowded for it was the day of pentecost and the crowd looked in	45.08756041526312
mousqueton also attracted attention and as the romance of don quixote was then t	64.09632558935266
on reaching the palace dartagnan sent to his eminence the letter in which he had	26.880141946854923
he was soon ordered to the presence of the cardinal	32.89064078815105
courage he whispered to porthos as they proceeded	50.94594414957421
do not be intimidated	34.97164305643505
believe me the eye of the eagle is closed forever	81.4654422866479
we have only the vulture to deal with	101.90879776795178
hold yourself as bolt upright as on the day of the bastion of st	51.64008785965089
gervais and do not bow too low to this italian that might give him a poor idea o	98.18444308966298
good answered porthos	15.710779764546082
mazarin was in his study working at a list of pensions and benefices of which he	42.20578458897879
he saw dartagnan and porthos enter with internal pleasure yet showed no joy in h	137.68930224962762
ah you is it monsieur le lieutenant you have been very prompt	105.54483284043235
tis well	11.702836376823617
welcome to ye	248.15459384039437
thanks my lord	9.284159156377063
here i am at your eminences service as well as monsieur du vallon one of my old 	22.703774214286245
porthos bowed to the cardinal	26.262873557389316
a magnificent cavalier remarked mazarin	342.0179379668359
porthos turned his head to the right and to the left and drew himself up with a 	26.59264414513414
the best swordsman in the kingdom my lord said dartagnan	35.123504631196404
porthos bowed to his friend	18.371559598993645
mazarin was as fond of fine soldiers as in later times frederick of prussia used	169.72647576761702
he admired the strong hands the broad shoulders and the steady eye of porthos	131.09149312011468
he seemed to see before him the salvation of his administration and of the kingd	43.112861507853005
he remembered that the old association of musketeers was composed of four person	104.32076947392
and your two other friends he asked	114.1194876233759
porthos opened his mouth thinking it a good opportunity to put in a word in his 	62.65239146348549
they are prevented at this moment but will join us later	104.56135983657762
mazarin coughed a little	142.73917862089618
and this gentleman being disengaged takes to the service willingly he asked	473.97327218601686
yes my lord and from pure devotion to the cause for monsieur de bracieux is rich	55.47820590659136
rich said mazarin whom that single word always inspired with a great respect	242.95414333971874
fifty thousand francs a year said porthos	16.19120854295593
these were the first words he had spoken	54.5553011723611
from pure zeal resumed mazarin with his artful smile from pure zeal and devotion	134.2532338477291
my lord has perhaps no faith in those words said dartagnan	57.852358954112304
have you monsieur le gascon asked mazarin supporting his elbows on his desk and 	28.258604653450668
i replied the gascon i believe in devotion as a word at ones baptism for instanc	94.2421414569492
and your friend for instance what does he expect to have at the end of his devot	25.453017140092996
well my lord my friend has three magnificent estates that of vallon at corbeil t	55.496091740465076
now my lord he would like to have one of his three estates erected into a barony	55.48971462061311
only that said mazarin his eyes twinkling with joy on seeing that he could pay f	29.38153934817141
i shall be baron explained porthos stepping forward	175.1311239634212
i told you so said dartagnan checking him with his hand and now his eminence con	46.70865732521605
and you monsieur dartagnan what do you want	19.5088062245892
my lord said dartagnan it is twenty years since cardinal de richelieu made me li	20.815664512369736
yes and you would be gratified if cardinal mazarin should make you captain	151.7846659214005
dartagnan bowed	79.02086060615537
well that is not impossible	36.19683249400108
we will see gentlemen we will see	26.90061921112065
now monsieur de vallon said mazarin what service do you prefer in the town or in	43.190835772917474
porthos opened his mouth to reply	39.92190508224812
my lord said dartagnan monsieur de vallon is like me he prefers service extraord	43.548156367177945
that boastfulness was not displeasing to mazarin he fell into meditation	107.74523615535506
and yet he said i must admit that i sent for you to appoint you to quiet service	61.729869679258364
in fact a great noise was heard in the antechamber at the same time the door of 	15.384184865433424
my lord the cardinal my lord the cardinal	24.17139562844381
mazarin thought that some one was going to assassinate him and he drew back push	58.58484557161664
dartagnan and porthos moved so as to plant themselves between the person enterin	85.06609277360178
well sir exclaimed mazarin what s the matter and why do you rush in here as if y	29.12056028587803
my lord replied the messenger i wish to speak to your eminence in secret	23.686958480079145
i am monsieur du poins an officer in the guards on duty at the donjon of vincenn	40.63254472653355
mazarin perceiving by the paleness and agitation of the messenger that he had so	58.307713197199796
dartagnan and porthos withdrew to a corner of the cabinet	28.996768726620747
speak monsieur speak at once said mazarin what is the matter	44.95486811450079
the matter is my lord that the duc de beaufort has contrived to escape from the 	25.949092964628015
mazarin uttered a cry and became paler than the man who had brought the news	37.62606359468583
he fell back almost fainting in his chair	104.56160913058321
escaped monsieur de beaufort escaped	65.8959807688902
my lord i saw him run off from the top of the terrace	25.478821218016456
and you did not fire on him	38.65426527982363
he was out of range	80.89602067865857
monsieur de chavignywhere was he	13.2824728005298
and la ramee	91.02799070704178
was found locked up in the prisoners room a gag in his mouth and a poniard near 	133.9496891519038
but the man who was under him	46.6002053625621
was an accomplice of the dukes and escaped along with him	84.65771765596814
mazarin groaned	436.3553257072847
my lord said dartagnan advancing toward the cardinal it seems to me that your em	23.582537150740187
it may still be possible to overtake the prisoner	73.72659144119808
france is large the nearest frontier is sixty leagues distant	183.49392636999895
and who is to pursue him cried mazarin	51.71143564196718
i pardieu	32734.00295947311
and you would arrest him	60.60554130981731
why not	53.53075342082036
you would arrest the duc de beaufort armed in the field	43.24346743316536
if your eminence should order me to arrest the devil i would seize him by the ho	81.03697785017135
so would i said porthos	56.39898448752156
so would you said mazarin looking with astonishment at those two men	38.540892041449496
but the duke will not yield himself without a furious battle	62.89469684191292
very well said dartagnan his eyes aflame battle it is a long time since we have 	25.02435589695967
battle cried porthos	13.716754083531287
and you think you can catch him	57.832776099578254
yes if we are better mounted than he	80.86613117464084
go then take what guards you find here and pursue him	219.1770177446563
you command us my lord to do so	46.532259574144206
and i sign my orders said mazarin taking a piece of paper and writing some lines	81.88836227538572
as for you my dear lieutenant i promise you nothing but if you bring him back to	35.505372697636865
to horse porthos said dartagnan taking his friend by the hand	37.235286734579994
here i am smiled porthos with his sublime composure	108.53981886064362
they descended the great staircase taking with them all the guards they found on	121.76291847255067
well baron i promise you some good exercise said the gascon	137.37510637623072
yes my captain	101.92089836778388
as they went the citizens awakened left their doors and the street dogs followed	199.14231086119844
at the corner of the cimetiere saint jean dartagnan upset a man it was too insig	18.631493073180646
the troop continued its course as though their steeds had wings	221.46525030184083
alas there are no unimportant events in this world and we shall see that this ap	23.917459312965875
chapter xxv	2.3070931206361873
an adventure on the high road	20.693743525773556
the musketeers rode the whole length of the faubourg saint antoine and of the ro	51.58868641682313
the horses seemed to become more lively with each successive step their nostrils	225.85619918846658
dartagnan freely applying his spurs was in advance of porthos two feet at the mo	92.40109068250811
from the top of an eminence dartagnan perceived a group of people collected on t	51.20508982552827
he rode on convinced that in this direction he would gain intelligence of the fu	84.02318218030187
in five minutes he had arrived at the place where the guards joined him coming u	39.595131513666345
the several members of that group were much excited	357.95467767016027
they looked at the cord still hanging from the loophole and broken at about twen	92.60553589323258
their eyes measured the height and they exchanged conjectures	166.884179114167
on the top of the wall sentinels went and came with a frightened air	48.77590089359564
a few soldiers commanded by a sergeant drove away idlers from the place where th	59.04047516541859
dartagnan went straight to the sergeant	28.633505163318862
my officer said the sergeant it is not permitted to stop here	60.961636163861435
that prohibition is not for me said dartagnan	33.432321890175984
have the fugitives been pursued	434.2414731167394
yes my officer unfortunately they are well mounted	231.62007003257244
how many are there	27.04196677065649
four and a fifth whom they carried away wounded	734.0453589717755
four said dartagnan looking at porthos	27.54811033305591
do you hear baron they are only four	71.29710451481989
a joyous smile lighted porthoss face	169.86119987503105
how long a start have they	195.08523123472463
two hours and a quarter my officer	97.72949316018112
two hours and a quarterthat is nothing we are well mounted are we not porthos	45.31674430675838
porthos breathed a sigh he thought of what was in store for his poor horses	99.83553759594916
very good said dartagnan and now in what direction did they set out	29.46720332116584
that i am forbidden to tell	26.805091792414842
dartagnan drew from his pocket a paper	18.37998888524039
order of the king he said	23.318903382963637
speak to the governor then	22.43453838581301
and where is the governor	30.538632436843137
in the country	35.15411691071559
anger mounted to dartagnans face he frowned and his cheeks were colored	123.28454858063675
ah you scoundrel he said to the sergeant i believe you are impudent to me wait	41.10727416916073
he unfolded the paper presented it to the sergeant with one hand and with the ot	53.56029451734596
order of the king i tell you	31.075233217273095
read and answer or i will blow out your brains	120.23931206120864
the sergeant saw that dartagnan was in earnest	53.40453869775605
the vendomois road he replied	303.64345507535114
and by what gate did they go out	139.91308976012533
by the saint maur gate	117.04231921038708
if you are deceiving me rascal you will be hanged tomorrow	60.2623587570444
and if you catch up with them you wo nt come back to hang me murmured the sergea	69.77757553436099
dartagnan shrugged his shoulders made a sign to his escort and started	30.91413055554235
this way gentlemen this way he cried directing his course toward the gate that h	108.63074013848173
but now that the duke had escaped the concierge had seen fit to fasten the gate 	86.78164348498305
it was necessary to compel him to open it as the sergeant had been compelled to 	31.01804464330413
this last obstacle having been overcome the troop pursued their course with thei	175.15024857485412
dartagnan who never turned his head did not perceive it	64.51573953521036
porthos told him of it in his calm manner	41.39013171715885
if only we two arrive said dartagnan it will be enough since the dukes troop are	91.45680245051892
that is true said porthos	4.6785363724725615
and he spurred his courser on	57.38975038480267
at the end of another two hours the horses had gone twelve leagues without stopp	40.81183919448268
let us rest here an instant to give these poor creatures breathing time said por	166.12341565449583
let us rather kill them yes kill them cried dartagnan i see fresh tracks tis not	255.37637507416954
in fact the road was trodden by horses feet visible even in the approaching gloo	84.86659646208243
they set out after a run of two leagues mousquetons horse sank	151.0435357401404
gracious me said porthos there s phoebus ruined	61.01904493697724
the cardinal will pay you a hundred pistoles	39.153806052446924
i m above that	349.8152596984488
let us set out again at full gallop	21.44470173784201
yes if we can	26.614977293146566
but at last the lieutenants horse refused to go on he could not breathe one last	105.62216450104083
the devil exclaimed porthos there s vulcan foundered	79.42184865279987
zounds cried dartagnan then we must stop give me your horse porthos	109.3795800725417
what the devil are you doing	13.570489156001509
by jove i am falling or rather bayard is falling answered porthos	116.37129165347011
all three then cried alls over	175.26127936924874
hush said dartagnan	3.7577458876691447
what is it	4.96840976942493
i hear a horse	169.48296469884562
it belongs to one of our companions who is overtaking us	90.9655515760036
no said dartagnan it is in advance	13.355919768186212
that is another thing said porthos and he listened toward the quarter indicated 	59.4005436722882
monsieur said mousqueton who abandoning his horse on the high road had come on f	26.132936884919634
silence said porthos	5.665087326727657
in fact at that moment a second neighing was borne to them on the night wind	65.111843009763
it is five hundred feet from here in advance said dartagnan	46.54953638033623
true monsieur said mousqueton and five hundred feet from here is a small hunting	63.48790036733024

not too well	52.900630648500496
we are out on the kings service	40.04367493125495
for the kings service we need horses	149.02081849207354
that is true said porthos	5.449601975167556
then not a word but set to work	117.77010425654935
they went on through the darkness silent as phantoms they saw a light glimmering	94.70307218368777
yonder is the house porthos said the gascon let me do what i please and do you w	28.218686969101743
they glided from tree to tree till they arrived at twenty steps from the house u	64.04347252048625
a groom was rubbing them down near them were saddles and bridles	148.51106478293534
dartagnan approached quickly making a sign to his two companions to remain a few	64.76741314021592
i buy those horses he said to the groom	94.92935760806792
the groom turned toward him with a look of surprise but made no reply	26.345536960942574
did nt you hear fellow	201.63640547352523
yes i heard	67.80236526353602
why then did nt you reply	85.57921058278603
because these horses are not to be sold was the reply	91.07991852475315
i take them then said the lieutenant	55.18734139504901
and he took hold of one within his reach his two companions did the same thing	131.79252737975295
sir cried the groom they have traversed six leagues and have only been unsaddled	67.68278263736383
half an hours rest is enough replied the gascon	193.79370262078353
the groom cried aloud for help	316.9751547983859
a kind of steward appeared just as dartagnan and his companions were prepared to	75.21119595346984
the steward attempted to expostulate	512.3126041688428
my dear friend cried the lieutenant if you say a word i will blow out your brain	40.56814452183924
but sir answered the steward do you know that these horses belong to monsieur de	32.91060407205122
so much the better they must be good animals then	46.185831465433765

come porthos come mousqueton	72.43237237843164
they all mounted the horses as quickly as possible	60.98736745720665
halloo hi hi cried the steward the house servants with the carbines	231.93637956875588
on on cried dartagnan there ll be firing on	132.28368303801227
they all set off swift as the wind	87.01007547151653
here cried the steward here whilst the groom ran to a neighboring building	111.02277867243694
take care of your horses cried dartagnan to him	21.358535202726166
fire replied the steward	47.57517658062173
a gleam like a flash of lightning illumined the road and with the flash was hear	57.13401598572934
they fire like grooms said porthos	411.316473407687
in the time of the cardinal people fired better than that do you remember the ro	94.63996241563864
ah sir my left side still pains me	707.4260563386068

egad did nt you hear these horses belong to monsieur de montbazon well monsieur 	64.45436479727645
and madame de montbazon is the mistress of the duc de beaufort	9.157486252134074
ah i understand replied porthos she has ordered relays of horses	80.65244469540737
exactly so	73.96483820304253
and we are pursuing the duke with the very horses he has just left	57.820037013560125
my dear porthos you are really a man of most superior understanding said dartagn	21.822062623587957
pooh replied porthos i am what i am	11.594993897077249
they rode on for an hour till the horses were covered with foam and dust	55.36179802632977
zounds what is yonder cried dartagnan	78.65842067011995
you are very lucky if you see anything such a night as this said porthos	54.5025183134482
something bright	32055.868738647692
i too cried mousqueton saw them also	214.69396190514834
ah ah have we overtaken them	184.28669184895477
good a dead horse said dartagnan pulling up his horse which shied it seems their	131.08380470229304
i seem to hear the noise of a troop of horsemen exclaimed porthos leaning over h	66.54839200392688
they appear to be numerous	78.41978713994519
then tis something else	1548.1850978131154
another horse said porthos	37.14725430742703
no dying	8418.115338163794
yes saddled and bridled	956.2409582363987
then we are upon the fugitives	121.9663600938754
courage we have them	96.61044070102346
but if they are numerous observed mousqueton tis not we who have them but they w	69.66563677289156
nonsense cried dartagnan they ll suppose us to be stronger than themselves as we	71.95205704787325
certainly remarked porthos	91.85346453950007
ah do you see cried the lieutenant	40.0492222131361
the lights again this time i too saw them said porthos	177.20658321591856
on on forward forward cried dartagnan in his stentorian voice we shall laugh ove	103.41924682812954
and they darted on anew	127.82184211561123
the horses excited by pain and emulation raced over the dark road in the midst o	70.67018262270452
chapter xxvi	2.4860460739111487
the rencontre	30.75115026635971
they rode on in this way for ten minutes	50.658389641338815
suddenly two dark forms seemed to separate from the mass advanced grew in size a	174.81666109976294
aha cried dartagnan they re coming toward us	140.08699230032772
so much the worse for them said porthos	9.458471646741597
who goes there cried a hoarse voice	69.94263589373342
the three horsemen made no reply stopped not and all that was heard was the nois	128.68468777005046
bridle in mouth said dartagnan	73.64096705640264
porthos understood him and he and the lieutenant each drew with the left hand a 	100.21328436558021
who goes there was asked a second time	51.826234602213596
not a step forward or you re dead men	206.16428742789515
stuff cried porthos almost choked with dust and chewing his bridle as a horse ch	64.06338659239634
stuff and nonsense we have seen plenty of dead men in our time	104.90725233489529
hearing these words the two shadows blockaded the road and by the light of the s	31.835818743373128
back shouted dartagnan or you are dead	98.31955905953187
two shots were the reply to this threat but the assailants attacked their foes w	96.57202808790657
as for porthos he assaulted the foe with such violence that although his sword w	71.02635696545808
finish mouston finish the work cried porthos	134.23178988878846
and he darted on beside his friend who had already begun a fresh pursuit	100.17019118679254
well said porthos	4.4131721931424535
i ve broken my mans skull cried dartagnan	143.71937392876904
and you	14.78244309022622
i ve only thrown the fellow down but hark	473.74641439336466
another shot of a carbine was heard	98.72112782029907
it was mousqueton who was obeying his masters command	73.00760277834942
on on cried dartagnan all goes well we have the first throw	158.85452916599078
ha ha answered porthos behold other players appear	292.72931223472494
and in fact two other cavaliers made their appearance detached as it seemed from	116.98920002720718
this time the lieutenant did not wait for the opposite party to speak	63.28159014797206
stand aside he cried stand off the road	91.74390067608364
what do you want asked a voice	12.641169812284359
the duke porthos and dartagnan roared out both at once	69.57052884736682
a burst of laughter was the answer but finished with a groan	91.41176441184804
dartagnan had with his sword cut in two the poor wretch who had laughed	144.20511644075535
at the same time porthos and his adversary fired on each other and dartagnan tur	20.439048905280206
bravo you ve killed him i think	138.03883478692484
no wounded his horse only	660.3665043666405

ho parbleau what is the matter with my horse	32.12438693963427
your horse is falling said porthos reining in his own	55.77230542730232
in truth the lieutenants horse stumbled and fell on his knees then a rattling in	75.4222253410546
he had received in the chest the bullet of dartagnans first adversary	77.44266448194092
dartagnan swore loud enough to be heard in the skies	150.7925277191072
does your honor want a horse asked mousqueton	49.134902888544254
zounds want one cried the gascon	197.12654866070196
heres one your honor	304.92317867142464
how the devil hast thou two horses asked dartagnan jumping on one of them	53.620819086043454
their masters are dead i thought they might be useful so i took them	142.15523576635448
meantime porthos had reloaded his pistols	64.45307397228424
be on the qui vive cried dartagnan	21.59274066189018
here are two other cavaliers	66.00727587637144
as he spoke two horsemen advanced at full speed	63.88633226008809
ho your honor cried mousqueton the man you upset is getting up	76.27162599434452
why did nt thou do as thou didst to the first man said porthos	59.23408831971456
i held the horses my hands were full your honor	215.29933259990125
a shot was fired that moment mousqueton shrieked with pain	164.7108940970193
ah sir i m hit in the other side exactly opposite the other this hurt is just th	205.25773507066742
porthos turned around like a lion plunged on the dismounted cavalier who tried t	168.98627283730687
mousqueton groaning slipped from his horse his wound not allowing him to keep th	144.99902363114307
on perceiving the cavaliers dartagnan had stopped and charged his pistol afresh 	80.12617816107775
here i am exclaimed porthos	36.69720051398146
shall we wait or shall we charge	138.52869389632946
let us charge them answered the gascon	41.49150314250472
charge cried porthos	22.318721036868453
they spurred on their horses the other cavaliers were only twenty steps from the	50.197420943466625
for the king cried dartagnan	13.925820636000974
the king has no authority here answered a deep voice which seemed to proceed fro	79.54627746183539
tis well we will see if the kings name is not a passport everywhere replied the 	48.20932253037233
see answered the voice	97.08980615896812
two shots were fired at once one by dartagnan the other by the adversary of port	76.64828261747664
dartagnans ball took off his enemys hat	321.02444624730543
the ball fired by porthoss foe went through the throat of his horse which fell g	69.26593216946938
for the last time where are you going	24.63554928370409
to the devil answered dartagnan	30.95189795302188
good you may be easy thenyoull get there	208.92019227866538
dartagnan then saw a musketbarrel leveled at him he had no time to draw from his	32.304771965650225
he recalled a bit of advice which athos had once given him and made his horse re	65.72881003362582
the ball struck the animal full in front	242.40216889741077
dartagnan felt his horse giving way under him and with his wonderful agility thr	99.80693091346906
ah this cried the voice the tone of which was at once polished and jeering this 	50.83147110374957
to the sword sir the sword	205.5650951954565
and he jumped off his horse	34.496768732166494
to the swords be it so replied dartagnan that is exactly what i want	36.26258367995812
dartagnan in two steps was engaged with the foe whom according to custom he atta	78.63340730714567
twice he was obliged to step back his opponent stirred not one inch	113.89100447634446
dartagnan returned and again attacked him	178.1275533575553
twice or thrice thrusts were attempted on both sides without effect sparks were 	352.58629829809297
at last dartagnan thought it was time to try one of his favorite feints in fenci	46.21147349333898
he brought it to bear skillfully executed it with the rapidity of lightning and 	60.494093865900076
the blow was parried	142.7199860482273
sdeath he cried with his gascon accent	34.75370550522279
at this exclamation his adversary bounded back and bending his bare head tried t	105.22859534589422
as to dartagnan afraid of some feint he still stood on the defensive	100.52950047257046
have a care cried porthos to his opponent i ve still two pistols charged	155.19620143212393
the more reason you should fire the first cried his foe	240.38449963863394
porthos fired the flash threw a gleam of light over the field of battle	136.65252199863366
as the light shone on them a cry was heard from the other two combatants	49.4107112093838
athos exclaimed dartagnan	30.989689324886324
dartagnan ejaculated athos	277.5704544729772
athos raised his sword dartagnan lowered his	54.4967750855327
aramis cried athos do nt fire	71.08961668752067
ah ha is it you aramis said porthos	33.39050887508347
and he threw away his pistol	55.418689741778806
aramis pushed his back into his saddlebags and sheathed his sword	64.57560230192341
my son exclaimed athos extending his hand to dartagnan	16.126423946990347
this was the name which he gave him in former days in their moments of tender in	64.52543076611983
athos cried dartagnan wringing his hands	24.661130217585843
so you defend him and i who have sworn to take him dead or alive i am dishonored	75.76624911945918

you can tell him sir answered a voice which was the voice of high command in the	47.42096073675901
the prince exclaimed at the same moment athos and aramis unmasking as they addre	31.51370483703634
fifty cavaliers cried the gascon and porthos	51.46503834053426
look around you gentlemen if you doubt the fact said the duke	64.1343578744592
the two friends looked to the right to the left they were encompassed by a troop	27.3894008139812
hearing the noise of the fight resumed the duke i fancied you had about twenty m	103.53826096104909
yes my lord but as you have said two that are a match for twenty said athos	42.536048049573935
come gentlemen your swords said the duke	45.3345101459074
our swords cried dartagnan raising his head and regaining his selfpossession	41.60496491752894
never added porthos	44.74615869787914
some of the men moved toward them	82.31830571940203
one moment my lord whispered athos and he said something in a low voice	29.117935994508226
as you will replied the duke	30.077786150688322
i am too much indebted to you to refuse your first request	64.51367841350773
gentlemen he said to his escort withdraw	50.49066431063894
monsieur dartagnan monsieur du vallon you are free	17.994229559652545
the order was obeyed dartagnan and porthos then found themselves in the centre o	52.838852919704095
now dherblay said athos dismount and come here	71.55267578663776
aramis dismounted and went to porthos whilst athos approached dartagnan	65.48926238416142
all four once more together	364.7690215626504
friends said athos do you regret you have not shed our blood	61.43645375717761

tis a matter of conscience with them as with us	150.06661737972829
meantime here we are enemies said porthos	45.51338759349261
gramercy who would ever have thought it	94.10616691178984
dartagnan only sighed	2569.697396781047
athos looked at them both and took their hands in his	30.197040739358574
gentlemen he said this is a serious business and my heart bleeds as if you had p	26.41008052193456

for my own part i demand it said aramis	37.32256674417336
i accept it interposed dartagnan proudly	203.65584245100078
porthos bowed as if in assent	81.79903150509196

alas murmured dartagnan our honor as soldiers is lost to us forever	181.6328363161172
dartagnan said athos gravely i assure you that you do me wrong in dwelling so up	126.85518856403358
what i think of is that we have crossed swords as enemies	214.28996495829747

and tell him cried a voice that i am not too old yet for a man of action	56.27240630671462
dartagnan recognized the voice of de rochefort	47.927169206410305

the duke as he spoke kissed his hand spurred his horse into a gallop and disappe	52.524557532463454
dartagnan and porthos were now alone with a man who held by the bridles two hors	38.54212336899086

who has given them to us said porthos	19.664994234269734
the comte de la fere	4.666275266662904
athos athos muttered dartagnan you think of every one you are indeed a nobleman 	104.58559399297312
to join the vicomte de bragelonne in flanders your honor	30.117569032490316
they were taking the road toward paris when groans which seemed to proceed from 	50.78926545701765
what is that asked dartagnan	9.499501274184286
it is imousqueton said a mournful voice whilst a sort of shadow arose out of the	43.44912483782226
porthos ran to him	61.808039875839434
art thou dangerously wounded my dear mousqueton he said	40.498303723875715
no sir but i am severely	32.07941386760128
what can we do said dartagnan we must return to paris	13.963402507461694
i will take care of mousqueton said grimaud and he gave his arm to his old comra	19.59897868648687
dartagnan and porthos went on meantime to paris	43.586630835268814
they were passed by a sort of courier covered with dust the bearer of a letter f	37.24688266473308
mazarin had passed a very bad night when this letter was brought to him announci	49.54182435582611
what consoles me said the cardinal after reading the letter is that at least in 	73.0947213728517
this gascon is a precious fellow even his misadventures are of use	151.4721042774785
the cardinal referred to that man whom dartagnan upset at the corner of the cime	36.412827341653326
chapter xxvii	2.7094428501258196
the four old friends prepare to meet again	71.95600273871285
well said porthos seated in the courtyard of the hotel de la chevrette to dartag	14.893581628812623
ifaith yes a brute that cardinal	515.5097867005718
what are you eating there porthos	57.969083223583134
i am dipping a biscuit in a glass of spanish wine do the same	54.9230069624992
you are right	5.66158344268527
gimblou a glass of wine	29.431914161266544
well how has all gone off	168.8652060879512
zounds you know there s only one way of saying things so i went in and said my l	146.04939594568606
yes i know that he said but give me the particulars	28.055271326037445
you know porthos i could not give him the particulars without naming our friends	77.57923201719406
there was firing nevertheless i heard he said and your swordsthey saw the light 	191.52716997940414
that is the night my lord i answered	46.73235005450288
ah cried the cardinal i thought you were a gascon my friend	22.214515273515328
i am a gascon said i only when i succeed	64.6567286777827
the answer pleased him and he laughed	255.90968780348905
that will teach me he said to have my guards provided with better horses for if 	143.84833807395594
well there s nothing bad in that it seems to me said porthos	26.60332949535896
oh mon dieu no nothing at all	69.72575616676296
it was the way in which he spoke	20.565430715409946
it is incredible how these biscuit soak up wine they are veritable sponges gimbl	265.5996877613855
the bottle was brought with a promptness which showed the degree of consideratio	36.29720017806713
he continued	179.71373826934055
so i was going away but he called me back	52.31776293854888
you have had three horses foundered or killed he asked me	113.73530289296144
yes my lord	5.917419492819317
how much were they worth	183.13885866217328
why said porthos that was very good of him it seems to me	29.04736336477321
a thousand pistoles i said	50.41225011287105
a thousand pistoles porthos exclaimed	45.80637681243548
oh oh that is a large sum	26.572369640608954
if he knew anything about horses he would dispute the price	136.82517730724953
faith he was very much inclined to do so the contemptible fellow	40.5838358630658
he made a great start and looked at me	58.10557307768595
i also looked at him then he understood and putting his hand into a drawer he to	54.69544917780313
for a thousand pistoles	22.322770835741146
for a thousand pistolesjust that amount the beggar not one too many	256.0011025359187
and you have them	36.07358206337884
they are here	30.508918671282647
upon my word i think he acted very generously	56.74367395611185
generously to men who had risked their lives for him and besides had done him a 	89.99773196325864
a great servicewhat was that	176.8645251093525
why it seems that i crushed for him a parliament councillor	121.43056674281539
what that little man in black that you upset at the corner of saint jean cemeter	63.26351789588853
that s the man my dear fellow he was an annoyance to the cardinal	36.08702732523506
unfortunately i did nt crush him flat	129.84681625339684
it seems that he came to himself and that he will continue to be an annoyance	39.12420664281481
see that now said porthos and i turned my horse aside from going plump on to him	103.15865458288562
he owed me for the councillor the pettifogger	126.68339449694051
but said porthos if he was not crushed completely	49.77025596335845
ah monsieur de richelieu would have said five hundred crowns for the councillor	68.40554260669408
well lets say no more about it	143.82591016244004
how much were your animals worth porthos	193.24253468382028
ah if poor mousqueton were here he could tell you to a fraction	88.09846123582429
no matter you can tell within ten crowns	334.79887160751576
why vulcan and bayard cost me each about two hundred pistoles and putting phoebu	97.46162526782996
there will remain then four hundred and fifty pistoles said dartagnan contentedl	48.51239091998169
yes said porthos but there are the equipments	21.168713815182954
that is very true	12.157981161402947
well how much for the equipments	89.33705771702591
if we say one hundred pistoles for the three	64.33599314608736
good for the hundred pistoles there remains then three hundred and fifty	148.8180130751344
porthos made a sign of assent	11.071282263379873
we will give the fifty pistoles to the hostess for our expenses said dartagnan a	49.79959774106848
we will share said porthos	71.11687604181498
a paltry piece of business murmured dartagnan crumpling his note	143.36632672534728
pooh said porthos it is always that	10.895330187733773
but tell me	18.468664184358026
did nt he speak of me in any way	30.17545704953124
ah yes indeed cried dartagnan who was afraid of disheartening his friend by tell	75.24315711474172
he said resumed porthos	52.03052811924318
stop i want to remember his exact words	204.62351133148525
he said as to your friend tell him he may sleep in peace	98.7118076276784
good very good said porthos that signified as clear as daylight that he still in	67.49427696179033
at this moment nine oclock struck	12.685252300801384
dartagnan started	349.3336920766809
ah yes said porthos there is nine oclock	26.582894735234238
we have a rendezvous you remember at the place royale	72.16429871800081
ah stop hold your peace porthos do nt remind me of it tis that which has made me	101.30337389215558
i shall not go	20.486675011605424
why asked porthos	15.039165551083995
because it is a grievous thing for me to meet again those two men who caused the	34.675408945855764
and yet said porthos neither of them had any advantage over us	103.55633228371316
i still had a loaded pistol and you were in full fight sword in hand	189.54853606381187
yes said dartagnan but what if this rendezvous had some hidden purpose	106.7654899554928
oh said porthos you ca nt think that dartagnan	20.018496201692834
dartagnan did not believe athos to be capable of a deception but he sought an ex	50.3865836013163
we must go said the superb lord of bracieux lest they should say we were afraid	94.59430404801793
we who have faced fifty foes on the high road can well meet two in the place roy	122.03733360889055
yes yes but they took part with the princes without apprising us of it	124.28555339082388
athos and aramis have played a game with me which alarms me	95.95547274266812
we discovered yesterday the truth what is the use of going today to learn someth	130.16514338124713
you really have some distrust then said porthos	90.82217768519611
of aramis yes since he has become an abb	70.35047210378453
you ca nt imagine my dear fellow the sort of man he is	50.85702472894021
he sees us on the road which leads him to a bishopric and perhaps will not be so	51.08404188331075
ah as regards aramis that is another thing said porthos and it would nt surprise	57.29202914646526
perhaps monsieur de beaufort will try in his turn to lay hands on us	45.801822943752285
nonsense he had us in his power and he let us go	51.67741888636226
besides we can be on our guard let us take arms let planchet post himself behind	107.93802053960832
planchet is a frondeur answered dartagnan	29.287115478930506
devil take these civil wars one can no more now reckon on ones friends than on o	299.2616469078135
ah if mousqueton were here there s a fellow who will never desert me	69.35417461329699
so long as you are rich ah my friend tis not civil war that disunites us	111.77862015223253
it is that we are each of us twenty years older it is that the honest emotions o	55.43573693355174
yes you are right let us go porthos but let us go well armed were we not to keep	36.50850134179461
halloo planchet here saddle our horses take your carbine	295.0439275841964
whom are we going to attack sir	51.001167570473896
no one a mere matter of precaution answered the gascon	59.87071004416852
you know sir that they wished to murder that good councillor broussel the father	110.37252516065959
really did they said dartagnan	61.605807844929
yes but he has been avenged	29.634017157416828
he was carried home in the arms of the people	25.25628898458008
his house has been full ever since	136.63304024839013
he has received visits from the coadjutor from madame de longueville and the pri	29.597180400017052
and now whenever he wishes	138.35896893314728
well whenever he wishes	224.87453007208967
planchet began to sing	66.76583017369363
un vent de fronde sest leve ce matin je crois quil gronde contre le mazarin	81.23165505263722
un vent de fronde sest leve ce matin	181.00997344481596
it does nt surprise me said dartagnan in a low tone to porthos that mazarin woul	12.682391541188728
you understand then monsieur resumed planchet that if it were for some enterpris	57.83558900327769
no do nt be alarmed but where did you get all these details	59.75896113056265
from a good source sir i heard it from friquet	65.37478806884137
from friquet i know that name	41.94151507950009
a son of monsieur de broussels servant and a lad that i promise you in a revolt 	65.05902118313912
is he not a singing boy at notre dame asked dartagnan	42.500112031400036
yes that is the very boy he s patronized by bazin	57.15445235618385
ah yes i know	14.69032132623533
of what importance is this little reptile to you asked porthos	60.18074825438634
gad replied dartagnan he has already given me good information and he may do the	45.23496440255186
whilst all this was going on athos and aramis were entering paris by the faubour	26.125305541731635
they had taken some refreshment on the road and hastened on that they might not 	40.24233641792593
bazin was their only attendant for grimaud had stayed behind to take care of mou	71.49196977824647
as they were passing onward athos proposed that they should lay aside their arms	98.40126216232665
oh no dear count cried aramis is it not a warlike encounter that we are going to	31.609315513231262
what do you mean aramis	5.629874703839943
that the place royale is the termination to the main road to vendomois and nothi	39.74072119262243
what our friends	274.60299624220846
are become our most dangerous enemies athos	348.7817648980561
let us be on our guard	18.341816398608852
oh my dear dherblay	9.260822659461395
who can say whether dartagnan may not have betrayed us to the cardinal who can t	52.9786585701122
what aramis you think that dartagnan that porthos would lend their hands to such	77.77902726059119
among friends my dear athos no you are right but among enemies it would be only 	61.147464799493854
athos crossed his arms and bowed his noble head	75.22080798373763
what can you expect athos men are so made and we are not always twenty years old	79.7479822885191
we have cruelly wounded as you know that personal pride by which dartagnan is bl	103.23217044619756
he has been beaten	74.96868433650563
did you not observe his despair on the journey as to porthos his barony was perh	48.17126943455463
well he found us on his road and will not be baron this time	68.20585182064372
perhaps that famous barony will have something to do with our interview this eve	129.83821024423062
let us take our precautions athos	19.587006059350355
but suppose they come unarmed what a disgrace to us	427.86321712623794
oh never fear besides if they do we can easily make an excuse we came straight o	158.95598777932284
an excuse for us to meet dartagnan with a false excuse to have to make a false e	45.825110313659025
go in whatever guise you choose for my part i shall go unarmed	116.58618122917595
no for i will not allow you to do so	16.16106850399167
tis not one man not athos only not the comte de la fere whom you will ruin by th	42.82147741070117
be it so then replied athos sorrowfully	25.888268223263736
and they pursued their road in mournful silence	214.5155980526613
scarcely had they reached by the rue de la mule the iron gate of the place royal	63.42865273222384
they were waiting at the entrance of the rue sainte catharine and their horses w	19.054041186683534
athos therefore commanded bazin to fasten up his horse and that of aramis in the	49.3346211474783
they then advanced two and two and saluted each other politely	153.56909567435068
now where will it be agreeable to you that we hold our conference inquired arami	59.778255558194864
the gate is shut said aramis but if these gentlemen like a cool retreat under th	112.64182826474241
dartagnan darted a look into the obscurity of the place	78.82291171947995
porthos ventured to put his head between the railings to try if his glance could	98.8022223689811
if you prefer any other place said athos in his persuasive voice choose for your	61.43411018715637
this place if monsieur dherblay can procure the key is the best that we can have	128.75619394115316
aramis went off at once begging athos not to remain alone within reach of dartag	142.0664652775533
aramis returned soon with a man from the hotel de rohan who was saying to him	34.5995572300472
you swear sir that it is not so	31.603709041913767
stop and aramis gave him a louis dor	65.37840425171827
ah you will not swear my master said the concierge shaking his head	42.186036242022126
well one can never say what may happen at present we and these gentlemen are exc	99.75887491657603
yes certainly added athos and the other two	52.682708040818795
dartagnan had heard the conversation and had understood it	64.53112311995336
you see he said to porthos	16.370379529900823
what do i see	19.692065495535882
that he would nt swear	93.1789259532954
swear what	116.80770565484276
that man wanted aramis to swear that we are not going to the place royale to fig	44.7223000389157
and aramis would nt swear	188.23854202385468
attention then	67.6513231268602
athos did not lose sight of the two speakers	25.391865900500104
aramis opened the gate and faced around in order that dartagnan and porthos migh	37.16748828043857
in passing through the gate the hilt of the lieutenants sword was caught in the 	36.66566411681476
do you see whispered aramis to athos touching his shoulder with one hand and poi	34.67795535596283
alas i do replied athos with a deep sigh	17.30382115118441
he entered third and aramis who shut the gate after him last	205.69844709315174
the two servingmen waited without but as if they likewise mistrusted each other 	78.78003810771577
chapter xxviii	2.36467174321505
the place royale	293.60315484080616
they proceeded silently to the centre of the place but as at this very moment th	39.20089205117214
there were benches here and there the four gentlemen stopped near them at a sign	85.23459453735293
after a few minutes of silent embarrassment athos spoke	92.55132603625685
gentlemen he said our presence here is the best proof of former friendship not o	93.61398661251299
hear me count replied dartagnan instead of making compliments to each other let 	110.1683004973986
i wish for nothing more have you any cause of complaint against me or monsieur d	82.92414808764023
i have replied dartagnan	25.80753180959519
when i saw you at your chateau at bragelonne i made certain proposals to you whi	51.20787338098888
dartagnan said athos reproachfully	59.67046335277731
you asked for candor and you have it	163.1211847225864
you ask what i have against you i tell you	48.561607152093885
and i have the same sincerity to show you if you wish monsieur dherblay i acted 	53.35368332068785
really monsieur you say strange things said aramis	125.26995377065069
you came seeking me to make to me certain proposals but did you make them no you	127.23071627429245
very well what did i say to you that mazarin was contemptible and that i would n	20.039531347826323
but that is all	17.028549524716485
did i tell you that i would nt serve any other on the contrary i gave you to und	22.01567970429636
we even joked very pleasantly if i remember rightly on the very probable conting	178.43223083336903
were you a party man there is no doubt of that	46.9657736855869
well why should not we too belong to a party you had your secret and we had ours	196.9415549075246
so much the better it proves that we know how to keep our secrets	41.96689183114256
i do not reproach you monsieur said dartagnan tis only because monsieur de la fe	28.660237571459867
and what do you find in it that is worthy of blame asked aramis haughtily	56.905735804525236
the blood mounted instantly to the temples of dartagnan who arose and replied	98.03731085973521
i consider it worthy conduct of a pupil of jesuits	117.35560933073226
on seeing dartagnan rise porthos rose also these four men were therefore all sta	183.25923538151127
upon hearing dartagnans reply aramis seemed about to draw his sword when athos p	56.20836610945973
dartagnan he said you are here tonight still infuriated by yesterdays adventure	171.60985535677042
i believed your heart noble enough to enable a friendship of twenty years to ove	120.88334996565895
come do you really think you have anything to say against me say it then if i am	45.187482050293454
the grave and harmonious tones of that beloved voice seemed to have still its an	119.18743592159973
he answered therefore	548.4114955363235
i think monsieur le comte that you had something to communicate to me at your ch	37.117915141888346
at that time i was not concerned in the adventure in the course of which you hav	30.2070065406783
if i had wished to widen the breach between those whom monsieur dherblay chooses	111.47096915474587

porthos who had not spoken one word answered merely by a word and a gesture	85.13191088029245
he said yes and he put his hand on his sword	22.333678612466397
aramis started back and drew his	60.25279065118736
dartagnan bent forward ready either to attack or to stand on his defense	199.0573411777502
athos at that moment extended his hand with the air of supreme command which cha	47.093823528492244
then turning to aramis	8.031297756912013
aramis he said break your sword	148.5232455646219
aramis hesitated	354.5500814135511
it must be done said athos then in a lower and more gentle voice he added	57.8985842204522
i wish it	39.78685293847557
then aramis paler than before but subdued by these words snapped the serpent bla	81.56848748563051
these proceedings made dartagnan and porthos draw back	108.7035941954666
dartagnan did not draw his sword porthos put his back into the sheath	30.838219282686197
never exclaimed athos raising his right hand to heaven never i swear before god 	90.94000684362253

i repeat my words aramis and then if you desire it and if they desire it let us 	54.606065072524785
there was a solemn though momentary silence which was broken by aramis	50.11194654946684
i swear he said with a calm brow and kindly glance but in a voice still tremblin	85.85936169450004

and he threw himself into the arms of athos	16.28881549528776
my son exclaimed athos pressing him in his arms	34.24799376910144
and as for me said porthos i swear nothing but i m choked	35.05976866582555
forsooth if i were obliged to fight against you i think i should allow myself to	33.56903033492043

you excel us all	1025.5250798365464
athos smiled with ineffable pleasure	157.48075867997463

devil take me if i ve ever been so happy as at this moment	52.64483907991035
and he wiped his eyes still moist	65.59292667040535

the host his mind at ease about his bill placed pen ink and paper upon the table	133.34262247705797
by a lucky chance the pen was tolerably good and raoul began to write	90.65663466698005
the host remained standing in front of him looking with a kind of involuntary ad	44.478515515210646
beauty has always been and always will be allpowerful	92.72156680279248

it seemed to me as if you were yourself preparing for some dangerous undertaking	83.45673277317077
i have therefore as you see great need of hearing from you	188.3019226385028
now that you are no longer beside me i am afraid every moment of erring	78.21778648237735

after finishing this letter raoul felt more composed he looked well around him t	111.22630671865235
during this time olivain had finished his bottle and eaten his pie the horses we	76.4988344727361
raoul motioned to the host to approach threw a crown upon the table mounted his 	118.15197299656133
the rest that had been thus afforded to men and horses enabled them to continue 	130.34153470927458
at verberie raoul desired olivain to make some inquiry about the young man who w	33.40506460428043
let us try and overtake this gentleman said raoul to olivain like ourselves he i	61.612182753361
it was about four oclock in the afternoon when raoul arrived at compiegne there 	18.374529561160948
he had stopped like raoul at the hotel of the bell and bottle the best at compie	58.96951675044835
well let us sleep at noyon said raoul	20.560920283790356
sir replied olivain respectfully allow me to remark that we have already much fa	43.31254831075138
i think it would be well to sleep here and to start again very early tomorrow	102.60273817117177
eighteen leagues is enough for the first stage	102.6812435657865
the comte de la fere wished me to hasten on replied raoul that i might rejoin th	35.51758999687857
we shall arrive at eight oclock	18.98032216924693
the horses will have a long nights rest and at five oclock tomorrow morning we c	113.72060664028216
olivain dared offer no opposition to this determination but he followed his mast	200.11897173001606

there you must rest young people are such braggarts	305.4743010095791
it was easy to see that olivain had not been taught in the school of the planche	12.957871528538819
raoul really felt tired but he was desirous of testing his strength and brought 	100.68258132439627
dartagnan that man of iron who seemed to be made of nerve and muscle only had st	90.78230033687561
therefore in spite of olivains remarks he continued to urge his steed more and m	75.16530468882934
a little troop of men on horseback were waiting on the edge of the stream ready 	34.17834885166618
raoul did not doubt this was the gentleman and his escort he called out to him b	51.90733084411772
raoul seeing that he could not arrive in time to cross the ferry with the travel	76.33187708438643
at this moment a shriek was heard that seemed to come from the river	18.765045713394816
raoul turned toward the side whence the cry had sounded and shaded his eyes from	72.2030210497259
olivain he exclaimed what do i see below there	101.61866860773962
a second scream more piercing than the first now sounded	172.43594679284894
oh sir cried olivain the rope which holds the ferryboat has broken and the boat 	69.42716684538797
but what do i see in the watersomething struggling	45.762331398805856
oh yes exclaimed raoul fixing his glance on one point in the stream splendidly i	52.15068545576512
they are sinking cried olivain in his turn	24.371163787334588
it was true and raoul was convinced that some accident had happened and that a m	67.9309692249675
ah sir cried olivain what are you doing good god	30.19127446200609
raoul was directing his horse toward the unhappy man in danger	103.1249158438598
this was in fact a custom familiar to him	67.92390813372624
having been brought up on the banks of the loire he might have been said to have	31.86725789464462
athos foreseeing the period when he should make a soldier of the viscount had in	158.12592123957478
oh heavens continued olivain in despair what would the count say if he only saw 	110.57101220996533
the count would do as i do replied raoul urging his horse vigorously forward	75.30047727381945

i am a dead man we are lost	34.73555577549362
in the meantime the ferryboat had floated away carried down by the stream and th	46.65249778934462
a man with gray hair had thrown himself from the boat into the river and was swi	37.97236664749336
raoul continued his way and was visibly gaining ground but the horse and its rid	150.14749896181155
the nostrils of the horse were no longer above water and the rider who had lost 	72.79850416936453
one moment longer and all would disappear	182.97065602708338
courage cried raoul courage	68.16098472764185
too late murmured the young man too late	25.143258896079285
the water closed above his head and stifled his voice	169.92868305430434
raoul sprang from his horse to which he left the charge of its own preservation 	58.49345632501999
raoul at the same time seized one of the young mans hands and placed it on the m	21.991982972597928
thus sure that the rider would not release his hold raoul now only directed his 	188.65773443448643

oh sir in the most natural way possible replied he to whom they had given the ti	55.02870391763385
we were about a third of the way across the river when the cord of the ferryboat	41.446902761491685
alarmed by the cries and gestures of the boatmen my horse sprang into the water	87.01650660292934
i can not swim and dared not throw myself into the river	63.08350012208089
instead of aiding the movements of my horse i paralyzed them and i was just goin	61.975728947542244
sir replied raoul bowing i am entirely at your service i assure you	20.74999083474175
i am called the count de guiche continued the young man my father is the marecha	16.522085324407673
i am the viscount de bragelonne answered raoul blushing at being unable to name 	58.86851605421984
viscount your countenance your goodness and your courage incline me toward you m	272.3708026436495
shake handsi crave your friendship	292.3319068113913
sir said raoul returning the counts pressure of the hand i like you already from	55.69388081589422
and now where are you going viscount inquired de guiche	33.14922964314107
to join the army under the prince count	137.99000346810564
and i too exclaimed the young man in a transport of joy	28.42741326001109
oh so much the better we will fire the first shot together	59.54665030527591
it is well be friends said the tutor young as you both are you were perhaps born	170.11636716382952
and now continued he you must change your clothes your servants to whom i gave d	109.0411412917307
linen and wine are both being warmed come	298.8280134995997
the young men had no objection to this proposition on the contrary they thought 	51.2913403846286
they mounted again at once whilst looks of admiration passed between them	250.71223829462622
they were indeed two elegant horsemen with figures slight and upright noble face	465.7858001122602
de guiche might have been about eighteen years of age but he was scarcely taller	33.41318130162083

the halt at noyon was but brief every one there being wrapped in profound sleep	475.4300944076864
raoul had desired to be awakened should grimaud arrive but grimaud did not arriv	102.87482663397871
doubtless too the horses on their part appreciated the eight hours of repose and	152.33863135200235
the count de guiche was awakened at five oclock in the morning by raoul who came	21.711084219481002
they breakfasted in haste and at six oclock had already gone ten miles	102.71576774229075
the young counts conversation was most interesting to raoul therefore he listene	210.24635306664032
brought up in paris where raoul had been but once at the court which raoul had n	30.091572169139425
raoul had only been at m	63.09087028903006

he criticised everybody humorously	3905.7589824476154
raoul trembled lest he should laugh among the rest at madame de chevreuse for wh	98.51182407423289
his praises increased raouls friendship twofold	1439.3232407456005
then came the question of gallantry and love affairs	339.65615202144767
under this head also bragelonne had much more to hear than to tell	139.43961038341754
he listened attentively and fancied that he discovered through three or four rat	128.6878172517846
de guiche as we have said before had been educated at the court and the intrigue	32.671335963529
it was the same court of which raoul had so often heard the comte de la fere spe	16.20756897008281
the young count witty and caustic passed all the world in review the queen herse	90.73651278780603

the horses which were more kindly used than on the previous day stopped at arras	155.18606330902784

the prince was said to be in person at bethune	53.85585885828407
the enemys army extended from cassel to courtray and as there was no species of 	89.70993799620581
arras was encumbered with fugitives	261.7406694383803
an approaching battle was much spoken of the prince having manoeuvred until that	326.5116076605431
the young men congratulated themselves on having arrived so opportunely	108.15363277682752
the evening was employed in discussing the war the grooms polished their arms th	147.8293346389636
in the morning it was rumored that prince de cond had evacuated bethune and fall	39.660700837089784
but as there was nothing positively certain in this report the young warriors de	184.68096761443647
the counts tutor was well acquainted with the country he consequently proposed t	138.46344630591682
they obtained information at ablain and a statement of their route was left for 	111.83609253739384
about seven oclock in the morning they set out	15.623380902900434
de guiche who was young and impulsive said to raoul here we are three masters an	52.32149265597155
our valets are well armed and yours seems to be tough enough	55.482385807114184

on my side i have two sure men who have been in action with my father	62.09162320421595

zounds how you manoeuvre my instructions count you seem to forget the orders i r	112.78167312944042
de guiche and raoul glanced at each other smiling	19.919287628867238
they arrived at ablain without accident	73.93398410480788
there they inquired and learned that the prince had in reality quitted bethune a	158.03252784057074
therefore leaving directions at every place for grimaud they took a crossroad wh	224.80816540551334
the country was beautiful intersected by valleys as green as the emerald	82.97770431540785
here and there they passed little copses crossing the path which they were follo	111.78229792650593
in anticipation of some ambuscade in each of these little woods the tutor placed	221.08582780720167
himself and the two young men represented the body of the army whilst olivain wi	33.10668929194723
they had observed for some time before them on the horizon a rather thick wood a	136.47012786874856
the servants had just disappeared under the trees followed by the tutor and the 	68.61026726218813

the young men impatient to learn the cause of the firing spurred on toward the s	62.580822025492196
the tutor followed them	378.0385324347156
were you stopped eagerly inquired the two youths	106.63707103332625
no replied the servants it is even probable that we have not been seen the shots	42.047053809964915
my advice is this said monsieur darminges and if needs be my will that we beat a	133.20719652428565
there may be an ambuscade concealed in this wood	143.89615480581205
did you see nothing there asked the count	19.924673868403364
i thought i saw said one of the servants horsemen dressed in yellow creeping alo	130.75443948515462
that s it said the tutor	41.02952013788886
we have fallen in with a party of spaniards	37.42024743271145
come back sirs back	1409.7367128446022
the two youths looked at each other and at this moment a pistolshot and cries fo	25.304169653620022
another glance between the young men convinced them both that neither had any wi	88.18138324326675
whilst they spurred their steeds they held their pistols ready also	97.11156773021949
in five minutes they arrived at the spot whence the noise had proceeded and then	40.61483005371557
hush whispered de guiche these are cavaliers	110.64632824570452
yes three on horseback and three who have dismounted	399.97122717461133
can you see what they are doing	17.386678465364636
yes they appear to be searching a wounded or dead man	103.12132621953378
it is some cowardly assassination said de guiche	73.7530331765907
they are soldiers though resumed de bragelonne	225.77824028731567
yes skirmishers that is to say highway robbers	213.6212114588466
at them cried raoul	52.803439879039544
at them echoed de guiche	153.97582601292768
oh gentlemen gentlemen in the name of heaven cried the poor tutor	37.652859799224224
but he was not listened to and his cries only served to arouse the attention of 	112.79560261913515
the men on horseback at once rushed at the two youths leaving the three others t	85.28614547208366
de guiche fired the first shot at ten paces and missed his man and the spaniard 	58.674083363846954
he let off his fire at but four paces	352.90722915039186
struck in the breast and extending his arms the spaniard fell back on the cruppe	22.61337350132401
raoul at this moment perceived the muzzle of a gun pointed at him and rememberin	39.61941919262718
his horse bounded to one side losing its footing and fell entangling raouls leg 	138.35487856236264
the spaniard sprang forward and seized the gun by its muzzle in order to strike 	90.1873119998025
in the position in which raoul lay unfortunately he could neither draw his sword	109.24520387519358
the butt end of the musket hovered over his head and he could scarcely restrain 	68.97105501026125
yield he cried or you are a dead man the musket fell from the soldiers hands who	74.96557433768275
guiche summoned one of his grooms and delivering the prisoner into his charge wi	71.61544809950665

without your aid continued he repeating the counts words i should have been a de	102.58732801713244
my antagonist took flight replied de guiche and left me at liberty to come to yo	73.57354250799143
but are you seriously wounded i see you are covered with blood	100.24683534393611
i believe said raoul that i have got something like a scratch on the arm	42.076326382586146
if you will help me to drag myself from under my horse i hope nothing need preve	56.601502892052046
monsieur darminges and olivain had already dismounted and were attempting to rai	48.179286579704666
at last raoul succeeded in drawing his foot from the stirrup and his leg from un	62.18540198373761
nothing broken asked de guiche	234.6886125530649
faith no thank heaven replied raoul but what has become of the poor wretches who	43.69786153270079
i fear we arrived too late	296.7943329470741
they have killed them i think and taken flight carrying off their booty	381.8924144120365
my servants are examining the bodies	96.16874531228385
let us go and see whether they are quite dead or if they can still be helped sug	29.318393235335662
olivain we have come into possession of two horses but i have lost my own	58.15466271576513
take for yourself the better of the two and give me yours	97.02098836718022
they approached the spot where the unfortunate victims lay	167.62140861550782
chapter xxxi	2.2449505957284397
the monk	284.0707502222477
two men lay prone upon the ground one bathed in blood and motionless with his fa	64.86671790724834
the other leaned against a tree supported there by the two valets and was prayin	93.16008903968878
he had received a ball in his thigh which had broken the bone	68.29092016947747
the young men first approached the dead man	73.83361231071726
he is a priest said bragelonne he has worn the tonsure	34.919228711663614
oh the scoundrels to lift their hands against a minister of god	156.15698814222844
come here sir said urban an old soldier who had served under the cardinal duke i	56.35207549181879
the wounded man smiled sadly	70.72122007120161
save me oh no said he but help me to die if you can	26.20580520513709
are you a priest asked raoul	12.550282742163617
no sir	30.8328524945035
i ask as your unfortunate companion appeared to me to belong to the church	146.62143660604488
he is the curate of bethune sir and was carrying the holy vessels belonging to h	82.82503774453613
and sir continued the wounded man i suffer much and would like if possible to be	104.55049119580099
where you can be relieved asked de guiche	55.39818719939629
no where i can confess	122.7603486478177
but perhaps you are not so dangerously wounded as you think said raoul	54.12034739423842
sir replied the wounded man believe me there is no time to lose the ball has bro	32.16046599540143
are you a surgeon asked de guiche	32.86129441399092
no but i know a little about wounds and mine i know is mortal	96.45527207766092
try therefore either to carry me to some place where i may see a priest or take 	94.81702902554903
it is my soul that must be saved as for my body it is lost	42.47651925305394
to die whilst doing a good deed it is impossible	202.6642395289791
god will help you	42.27137349479533
gentlemen in the name of heaven said the wounded man collecting all his forces a	35.020228304604196
either help me to gain the nearest village or swear to me on your salvation that	82.51043469883206
but he added in a despairing tone perhaps no one will dare to come for it is kno	51.38275872765039
my god my god good god good god added the wounded man in an accent of terror whi	41.88323772530803
calm yourself sir replied de guiche	38.55556026010849
i swear to you you shall receive the consolation that you ask	79.65187047145082
only tell us where we shall find a house at which we can demand aid and a villag	45.20541276955073
thank you and god reward you about half a mile from this on the same road there 	83.86891202035558
there you must find the curate or if he is not at home go to the convent of the 	41.97944083812716
monk or priest it matters not provided only that he has received from holy churc	178.12050365664467
monsieur darminges said de guiche remain beside this unfortunate man and see tha	58.08360566243826
the vicomte and myself will go and find a priest	163.353919497238
go sir replied the tutor but in heavens name do not expose yourself to danger	84.55903522126235
do not fear	26.70915217373509
besides we are safe for today you know the axiom non bis in idem	139.64275214479704
courage sir said raoul to the wounded man	15.24357417423065
we are going to execute your wishes	30.793673858338547
may heaven prosper you replied the dying man with an accent of gratitude impossi	39.22335745501609
the two young men galloped off in the direction mentioned and in ten minutes rea	38.310310030619526
raoul without dismounting called to the host and announced that a wounded man wa	86.91731263641776
he desired him also should he know in the neighborhood any doctor or chirurgeon 	148.6268934250801
the host who saw two young noblemen richly clad promised everything they require	227.6803684996024
they had gone rather more than a league and had begun to descry the first houses	50.21277823332202
chance for once seemed to favor them in sending what they were so assiduously se	156.35838721646175
he was a man about twentytwo or twentythree years old but who appeared much olde	52.85674477342889
his complexion was pale not of that deadly pallor which is a kind of neutral bea	90.12102318517944
sir began raoul with his usual politeness are you an ecclesiastic	55.34696402195174
why do you ask me that replied the stranger with a coolness which was barely civ	29.528050932451027
because we want to know said de guiche haughtily	72.07684554700502
the stranger touched his mule with his heel and continued his way	92.10091202222196
in a second de guiche had sprung before him and barred his passage	85.68897106014525
answer sir exclaimed he you have been asked politely and every question is worth	120.54362707527429
i suppose i am free to say or not to say who i am to two strangers who take a fa	60.80889701117727
it was with difficulty that de guiche restrained the intense desire he had of br	86.71111804330971
in the first place he said making an effort to control himself we are not people	40.95038030592033
nor was it from caprice we asked the question for there is a wounded and dying m	138.46404052783814
if you be a priest i conjure you in the name of humanity to follow me to aid thi	32.33944982521344
the pale face of the monk became so livid and his smile so strange that raoul wh	80.33375852023548
he is some spanish or flemish spy said he putting his hand to his pistol	30.198588679174353
a glance threatening and transient as lightning replied to raoul	166.42438361040678
well sir said de guiche are you going to reply	25.071874577810785
i am a priest said the young man	7.960584828775511
then father said raoul forcing himself to convey a respect by speech that did no	177.46863821030826
at the next inn you will find a wounded man now being attended by our servants w	106.31228866234645
i will go said the monk	25.114034137003326
and he touched his mule	92.48272635004477
if you do not go sir said de guiche remember that we have two steeds able to cat	34.92613114447872
the monks eye again flashed but that was all he merely repeated his phrase i wil	146.3126001862818
let us follow him said de guiche it will be the surest plan	22.33400342542753
i was about to propose so doing answered de bragelonne	114.98777748737206
in the space of five minutes the monk turned around to ascertain whether he was 	39.20076120429676
you see said raoul we have done wisely	51.506061761623265
what a horrible face that monk has said de guiche	138.85691620459025
horrible replied raoul especially in expression	154.41823691201583
yes yes said de guiche a strange face but these monks are subject to such degrad	58.353690143491285
well said raoul the poor man will get his priest but by heaven the penitent appe	79.34016444630545
i confess i am accustomed to priests of a very different appearance	79.33346840496033
ah exclaimed de guiche you must understand that this is one of those wandering b	36.70295800130283
i have seen them before	45.90273652163459
as ugly	1005.6018753861762
no but reasonably hideous	623.4293834061901
what a misfortune for the wounded man to die under the hands of such a friar	79.93274004562826
pshaw said de guiche	14.450109329581474
absolution comes not from him who administers it but from god	327.93884058404853
however for my part i would rather die unshriven than have anything to say to su	58.786522564428
you are of my opinion are you not viscount and i see you playing with the pommel	64.70114017581203
yes count it is a strange thing and one which might astonish you but i feel an i	67.44206289512822
have you ever seen a snake rise up on your path	66.55086720415486
never answered de guiche	36.26142517819165
well it has happened to me to do so in our blaisois forests and i remember that 	26.648794919704784
your father asked de guiche	44.31158590785411
no my guardian replied raoul blushing	32.435678789417594
very well	2.2663568875728948
until the moment when the comte de la fere resumed raoul said come bragelonne dr	27.84384664654621
well i vow i felt exactly the same sensation at sight of that man when he said w	91.75776949182338
then you regret that you did not cut your serpent in two morsels	81.97650063995987
faith yes almost said raoul	147.53765104687895
they had now arrived within sight of the little inn and could see on the opposit	62.687773436585154
the youths spurred on	396.96158463884103
there is the wounded man said de guiche passing close to the augustine brother	58.9799497691243
be good enough to hurry yourself a little monsieur monk	142.35574920847583
as for raoul he avoided the monk by the whole width of the road and passed him t	37.48990130040029
the young men rode up to the wounded man to announce that they were followed by 	34.80272645812513
he raised himself to glance in the direction which they pointed out saw the monk	78.43571837552558
and now said the youths we have done all we can for you and as we are in haste t	39.578633455923786
you will excuse us sir but we are told that a battle is expected and we do not w	50.54516525816866
go my young sirs said the sick man and may you both be blessed for your piety	74.48930766961
you have done for me as you promised all that you could do	51.64650278733113
as for me i can only repeat may god protect you and all dear to you	90.55657283409478
sir said de guiche to his tutor we will precede you and you can rejoin us on the	45.36966249186066
the host was at his door and everything was preparedbed bandages and lint and a 	74.79458027793217
everything said he to raoul shall be done as you desire but you will not stop to	29.531704937174723
oh my woundminetis nothing replied the viscount it will be time to think about i	51.966730904281775
this cavalier is my attendant	324.8180287007223
would it not be safer and more certain if i should ask him his name and tell him	52.66743664238923
there is no harm in overprecaution	23.778334315789277
i am the viscount de bragelonne and he is called grimaud	15.358564105910382
at this moment the wounded man arrived from one direction and the monk from the 	34.06045277546851
sir monk said de guiche confess well that brave man and be not concerned for you	93.30448410798209
thanks monsieur said the monk with one of those smiles that made bragelonne shud	30.669313551871216
come count said raoul who seemed instinctively to dislike the vicinity of the au	56.385055565714616
the litter borne by two servants now entered the house	218.16590677533594
the host and his wife were standing on the steps whilst the unhappy man seemed t	47.671767752563056
at sight of this pale bleeding man the wife grasped her husbands arm	187.5640466011613
well what s the matter asked the latter are you going to be ill just now	38.395257906932045
no but look replied the hostess pointing to the wounded man i ask you if you rec	38.83718064205148
that manwait a bit	981.6104002334168
ah i see you know him exclaimed the wife for you have become pale in your turn	51.57370755561333

the former executioner of bethune murmured the young monk shrinking back and sho	63.67226001161683
monsieur darminges who was at the door perceived his hesitation	50.822370424020185
sir monk said he whether he is now or has been an executioner this unfortunate b	158.69765735199212
render to him then the last service he can by any possibility ask of you and you	86.25967081246408
the monk made no reply but silently wended his way to the room where the two val	42.86433763851976
darminges and olivain and the two grooms then mounted their horses and all four 	53.749608119983286
just as the tutor and his escort disappeared in their turn a new traveler stoppe	79.75357242422055
what does your worship want demanded the host pale and trembling from the discov	38.62057744008619
the traveler made a sign as if he wished to drink and then pointed to his horse 	34.299163429031154
ah diable said the host to himself this man seems dumb	64.47668171537141
and where will your worship drink	84.23206179544218
there answered the traveler pointing to the table	88.65087697158832
i was mistaken said the host he s not quite dumb	91.70842879866372
and what else does your worship wish for	43.23601391228824
to know if you have seen a young man pass fifteen years of age mounted on a ches	36.402194063690224
the viscount de bragelonne	27.196529690773747
just so	77.20551040794751
then you are called monsieur grimaud	31.125068438799463
the traveler made a sign of assent	27.85799022197376
well then said the host your young master was here a quarter of an hour ago he w	27.475944092878173

two miles and a half	63.12279756438638
thank you	3.1289884011881126
grimaud was drinking his wine silently and had just placed his glass on the tabl	74.88754489994147
grimaud sprang up	80.44239145186884
what is that said he whence comes that cry	91.73620154460154
from the wounded mans room replied the host	84.7208362729154
what wounded man	786.7447793032202
the former executioner of bethune who has just been brought in here assassinated	73.00311207328609
the old executioner of bethune muttered grimaud a man between fiftyfive and sixt	60.20560448321221
that is he except that his beard has turned gray and his hair is white do you kn	73.73991660942602
i have seen him once replied grimaud a cloud darkening his countenance at the pi	31.94288428420839
at this instant a second cry less piercing than the first but followed by prolon	51.42165686182348
the three listeners looked at one another in alarm	130.8499300056086
we must see what it is said grimaud	14.109797595484563
it sounds like the cry of one who is being murdered murmured the host	104.82284634347079
mon dieu said the woman crossing herself	24.9178584927537
if grimaud was slow in speaking we know that he was quick to act he sprang to th	84.1476773106814
open the door cried the host open it instantly sir monk	124.2338859513669
no reply	349.9021758547523
unfasten it or i will break it in said grimaud	99.52591781720656
the same silence and then ere the host could oppose his design grimaud seized a 	173.74380101255574
the room was inundated with blood dripping from the mattresses upon which lay th	73.21908255062459
the monk cried the host where is the monk	62.30810553441625
grimaud sprang toward an open window which looked into the courtyard	76.73425690848184
he has escaped by this means exclaimed he	68.36673783494687
do you think so said the host bewildered boy see if the mule belonging to the mo	70.68379799440687
there is no mule cried he to whom this question was addressed	43.13957438098698
the host clasped his hands and looked around him suspiciously whilst grimaud kni	32.375307283358865
there can be no longer any doubt but that it is himself said he	33.722309723108786
does he still live inquired the innkeeper	115.22258153934452
making no reply grimaud opened the poor mans jacket to feel if the heart beat wh	120.27434858827424

the absolution	6184.539660606202
this is what had taken place we have seen that it was not of his own free will b	56.44130325227802
perhaps he would have sought to escape by flight had he seen any possibility of 	65.25276577215377
he was restrained by the threats of the two gentlemen and by the presence of the	28.762616332395044
and besides he considered it most expedient without exhibiting too much illwill 	168.00838699674432
the monk entered the chamber and approached the bed of the wounded man	57.41786170321403
the executioner searched his face with the quick glance peculiar to those who ar	114.01184833915448
he made a movement of surprise and said	41.31462031886362
father you are very young	36.99746439729691
men who bear my robe have no age replied the monk dryly	179.7031125041402
alas speak to me more gently father in my last moments i need a friend	178.06759733767313
do you suffer much asked the monk	52.68559704339983
yes but in my soul much more than in my body	74.77279223778041
we will save your soul said the young man but are you really the executioner of 	34.25507386623178
that is to say eagerly replied the wounded man who doubtless feared that the nam	45.74993864685745
i still assist at executions but no longer strike the blow myselfno indeed	310.7623443029405
you have then a repugnance to your profession	75.50894869000226
so long as i struck in the name of the law and of justice my profession allowed 	38.96904639029237
the executioner paused and shook his head with an expression of despair	31.049831033918455
tell me about it said the monk who sitting on the foot of the bed began to be in	20.387775753446785
ah cried the dying man with all the effusiveness of a grief declared after long 	97.96235600421596
that is not all the money gained in the exercise of my profession i have distrib	33.753632118750524
all have forgiven me some have even loved me but i think that god has not pardon	121.03602380555186
a woman you have assassinated a woman then cried the monk	76.86807238042431
you also exclaimed the executioner you use that word which sounds ever in my ear	247.47265398999926
the monk doubtless feared that he would die without saying more for he exclaimed	245.159791868621
go on i know nothing as yet when you have finished your story god and i will jud	67.40531530852711
oh father continued the executioner without opening his eyes as if he feared on 	58.67565015182333
delirium murmured the monk shaking his head	27.179442820243953
the executioner opened his eyes turned toward the young man and grasped his arm	33.26953948394944
delirium he repeated delirium do you say oh no i remember too well	107.49316797961718
it was evening i had thrown the body into the river and those words which my rem	73.03354287529226
after being the instrument of human justice i aspired to be that of the justice 	78.69593687174968
but let me see how was it done speak said the monk	72.15070780341583
it was at night	36.482067237632194
a man came to me and showed me an order and i followed him	50.87436680625341
four other noblemen awaited me	138.93804976659214
they led me away masked	520.0432452427436
i reserved the right of refusing if the office they required of me should seem u	283.4454995182028
we traveled five or six leagues serious silent and almost without speaking	156.87390553955672
at length through the window of a little hut they showed me a woman sitting lean	72.83513563116351
horrible said the monk	20.474370010543183
and you obeyed	297.7724468557817
father that woman was a monster	93.00318886469604
it was said that she had poisoned her second husband she had tried to assassinat	42.131346499080436
buckingham cried the monk	39.588438966900895
yes buckingham	77.91670810870345
the woman was english then	143.22386196976217
no she was french but she had married in england	36.499093200507836
the monk turned pale wiped his brow and went and bolted the door	52.724249543739525
the executioner thought that he had abandoned him and fell back groaning upon hi	78.2060760549155
no no i am here said the monk quickly coming back to him	37.7499558567015
go on who were those men	166.05174261563903
one of them was a foreigner english i think	31.292649097785702
the four others were french and wore the uniform of musketeers	104.30510128459338
their names asked the monk	134.6037351642073
i do nt know them but the four other noblemen called the englishman my lord	41.654214089507065
was the woman handsome	273.1668078466116
young and beautiful	206.08722930684434
oh yes especially beautiful	1016.0190761669542

i have never understood how i could have laid low a head so beautiful with a fac	73.51543360107074
the monk seemed agitated by a strange emotion he trembled all over he seemed eag	151.33875876225537
at length with a violent effort at selfcontrol	62.375198952314555
the name of that woman he said	49.7995027559644
i do nt know what it was	7.8210996195328715
as i have said she was twice married once in france the second time in england	47.414008033081714
she was young you say	188.80937629148025
twentyfive years old	116.27372539194214
abundance of hairfalling over her shoulders	281.6282127820336
eyes of an admirable expression	68.60287386155146
when she chose	241.05506813728033
oh yes it is she	24.63680038644694
a voice of strange sweetness	92.29800313002812
how do you know it	7.742815084261697
the executioner raised himself on his elbow and gazed with a frightened air at t	39.620033187750636
and you killed her the monk exclaimed	220.7378932157015
you were the tool of those cowards who dared not kill her themselves you had no 	76.47840980721645
alas i have already told you father that woman under that angelic appearance had	123.34499607486443
to you what could she have done to you come tell me	68.04813487643318
she had seduced and ruined my brother a priest	216.21022985268468
she had fled with him from her convent	114.03430333057504
with your brother	140.56226776643217
yes my brother was her first lover and she caused his death	98.02819545615358
oh father do not look in that way at me oh i am guilty then you will not pardon 	62.260022279384124
the monk recovered his usual expression	221.91885608166186
yes yes he said i will pardon you if you tell me all	21.298886304107018
oh cried the executioner all all all	51.3268039548177

if she caused his deathyou said that she caused his death	117.96507466146087
yes repeated the executioner	77.07070325539733
then you must know what her name was as a young girl	39.08355796510981
oh mon dieu cried the executioner i think i am dying	16.545267844335285

her name wasmy god have pity on me murmured the executioner and he fell back on 	59.44845952519682
her name repeated the monk bending over him as if to tear from him the name if h	63.44377710437659
the dying man collected all his forces	120.83534398673729
the monks eyes glittered	526.6545437428356
anne de bueil murmured the wounded man	27.53256830714634
anne de bueil cried the monk standing up and lifting his hands to heaven	31.202236314136723
anne de bueil you said anne de bueil did you not	28.14917973766493
yes yes that was her name and now absolve me for i am dying	48.345661363240225
i absolve you cried the priest with a laugh which made the dying mans hair stand	68.85325238515621
you are not a priest cried the executioner	18.90613107914229
what then are you	37.794776891463236
i am about to tell you wretched man	62.86690176554008
oh mon dieu	15.600846599178153
i am john francis de winter	27.63720426452383
i do not know you said the executioner	10.2801341374745
wait wait you are going to know me	33.05716465551782
i am john francis de winter he repeated and that woman	67.1308740568771
well that woman	368.41893297305387
was my mother	60.255721260941115
the executioner uttered the first cry that terrible cry which had been first hea	106.34600528476817
oh pardon me pardon me he murmured if not in the name of god at least in your ow	51.76742711423669
pardon you cried the pretended monk pardon you perhaps god will pardon you but i	167.9765852881417
for pitys sake said the executioner extending his arms	27.13815072180609
no pity for him who had no pity die impenitent die in despair die and be damned 	181.09466559980171
then was heard that second cry not so loud as the first and followed by a long g	81.74522256266202
the executioner who had lifted himself up fell back upon his bed	54.41197057650285
as to the monk without withdrawing the poniard from the wound he ran to the wind	69.40813381931687
chapter xxxiii	3.0262211798831085
grimaud speaks	6508.359985189393
grimaud was left alone with the executioner who in a few moments opened his eyes	56.45449231524923
help help he murmured oh god have i not a single friend in the world who will ai	52.363423486382
take courage said grimaud they are gone to find assistance	50.55621714750437
who are you asked the wounded man fixing his half opened eyes on grimaud	56.42617999816788
an old acquaintance replied grimaud	22.820088007447563
you and the wounded man sought to recall the features of the person now before h	63.28693135077758
under what circumstances did we meet he asked again	92.60165009183042
one night twenty years ago my master fetched you from bethune and conducted you 	120.97913071006889
i know you well now said the executioner you were one of the four grooms	33.09472528750098
just so	92.35928694215602
where do you come from now	44.60888710652616
i was passing by and drew up at this inn to rest my horse	150.17893285479738
they told me the executioner of bethune was here and wounded when you uttered tw	55.778848010699775
at the first we ran to the door and at the second forced it open	52.043455781456835
and the monk exclaimed the executioner did you see the monk	46.42527976431379
what monk	5415.549794117723
the monk that was shut in with me	217.64430266491652
no he was no longer here he appears to have fled by the window	39.468345165249495
was he the man that stabbed you	212.67314779269745
yes said the executioner	18.824639009244322
grimaud moved as if to leave the room	46.413006254978804
what are you going to do asked the wounded man	6.074368194437638
he must be apprehended	71.93377245364462
do not attempt it he has revenged himself and has done well	85.82035384812157
now i may hope that god will forgive me since my crime is expiated	90.67730022209999
explain yourself	95.5857076966887
said grimaud	1.9808083098216345
the woman whom you and your masters commanded me to kill	127.51076571760073
yes milady it is true you called her thus	107.50649555731493
what has the monk to do with this milady	23.625064796734616
she was his mother	59.14256052494754
grimaud trembled and stared at the dying man in a dull and leaden manner	42.53670724465064
his mother he repeated	160.4659238902887
yes his mother	198.6192082738193
but does he know this secret then	102.38935469820191
i mistook him for a monk and revealed it to him in confession	77.33269856047745
unhappy man cried grimaud whose face was covered with sweat at the bare idea of 	46.50089587784907
i pronounced no name for i knew none except his mothers as a young girl and it w	147.8332116683935
thus speaking he fell back exhausted	210.4559868503749
grimaud wishing to relieve him advanced his hand toward the hilt of the dagger	109.28542643528807
touch me not said the executioner if this dagger is withdrawn i shall die	79.36983054457198
grimaud remained with his hand extended then striking his forehead he exclaimed	102.85412770075014
oh if this man should ever discover the names of the others my master is lost	91.81313438343858
haste haste to him and warn him cried the wounded man if he still lives warn his	103.04282829977004
my death believe me will not be the end of this atrocious misadventure	55.99024498083261
where was the monk going asked grimaud	29.015994261441623
toward paris	5.0016288144952386
who stopped him	159.20054240657538
two young gentlemen who were on their way to join the army and the name of one o	34.80122462192733
and it was this young man who brought the monk to you then it was the will of go	69.2944086490245
and yet that woman deserved her fate do you not think so	81.9049591079829
on ones deathbed the crimes of others appear very small in comparison with ones 	388.00328029081743
grimaud was reluctant to leave the man alone and yet he perceived the necessity 	63.22612262132767
whilst he thus hesitated the host reentered the room followed not only by a surg	92.12963830885738
the surgeon approached the dying man who seemed to have fainted	82.87675160104516
we must first extract the steel from the side said he shaking his head in a sign	61.106803774834525
the prophecy which the wounded man had just uttered recurred to grimaud who turn	116.6557483481184
the weapon as we have already stated was plunged into the body to the hilt and a	51.96118055501173
when at last the blade had been entirely withdrawn a red froth issued from the m	105.30961204138183
then grimaud lifting the dagger from the pool of blood which was gliding along t	67.0577379330685
grimauds first intention had been to return to paris but he remembered the anxie	45.49085515326861
raoul was seated at table with the count de guiche and his tutor when all at onc	42.67985201994556
grimaud my good grimaud exclaimed raoul here you are at last excuse me sirs this	80.14108033093281
how did you leave the count continued he	35.394871760471965
does he regret me a little have you seen him since i left him answer for i have 	52.59459428380151
it is the blood of the unfortunate man whom you left at the inn and who died in 	55.53818322661888
in your armsthat man but know you who he was	173.50279924181174
he used to be the headsman of bethune	34.02383212710161
you knew him and he is dead	46.513536407976716
well sir said darminges it is the common lot even an executioner is not exempted	62.35619619026406
i had a bad opinion of him the moment i saw his wound and since he asked for a m	72.56017363074326
at the mention of the monk grimaud became pale	25.91468655409114
come come continued darminges to dinner for like most men of his age and generat	76.25089839845049
you are right sir said raoul	5.1107807755982675
come grimaud order dinner for yourself and when you have rested a little we can 	147.92875969191573
no sir no said grimaud	20.81233471230992
i can not stop a moment i must start for paris again immediately	90.43928360829021
what you start for paris you are mistaken it is olivain who leaves me you are to	59.81897383635892
on the contrary olivain is to stay and i am to go	27.874513432085216
i have come for nothing else but to tell you so	48.121140865214926
but what is the meaning of this change	21.98608505410735
i can not tell you	8.036364028218678
explain yourself	62.544456585521154
i can not explain myself	51.57513392642612
come tell me what is the joke	39.449755410685476
monsieur le vicomte knows that i never joke	84.51767610605235
yes but i know also that monsieur le comte de la fere arranged that you were to 	28.159933273644615
i shall follow the counts directions	156.49488696837037
not under present circumstances monsieur	801.7437441486321
perhaps you mean to disobey me	60.135338966688614
yes monsieur i must	46.8078525185677
you persist then	269.185905859883
yes i am going may you be happy monsieur and grimaud saluted and turned toward t	104.7845660290033
raoul angry and at the same time uneasy ran after him and seized him by the arm	75.35237941760931
grimaud he cried remain i wish it	121.74097336059319
then replied grimaud you wish me to allow monsieur le comte to be killed	39.213520829496964
he saluted and made a movement to depart	90.61320048079874
grimaud my friend said the viscount will you leave me thus in such anxiety speak	60.00901612249344
i can tell you but one thing sir for the secret you wish to know is not my own	40.59832333119206
you met a monk did you not	64.50986397391266
the young men looked at each other with an expression of fear	10.70795771672966
you conducted him to the wounded man and you had time to observe him and perhaps	72.26801796750591
yes yes cried both young men	131.58016169490773
very well if ever you meet him again wherever it may be whether on the high road	68.89151204550389
and without adding another word grimaud profiting by the astonishment and terror	223.02625612606545
two minutes later the thunder of a horses hoofs was heard upon the road it was g	31.87927219581112
when once in the saddle grimaud reflected on two things first that at the pace h	201.73921359793644
but grimauds ingenuity was more prolific than his speech and therefore at the fi	58.043736505087956
chapter xxxiv	2.5978322398786813
on the eve of battle	18.558236307163643
raoul was aroused from his sombre reflections by his host who rushed into the ap	76.401793005142
that cry was of such importance as to overcome all preoccupation	211.26054741941684
the young men made inquiries and ascertained that the enemy was advancing by way	74.15758811972444
while monsieur darminges gave orders for the horses to be made ready for departu	48.29963490337997
this time it was not a wandering troop of partisans it was an entire army	74.62831756153922
there was therefore nothing for them to do but to follow the prudent advice of m	103.25570264675125
they quickly went downstairs	563.4474205246959
monsieur darminges was already mounted	81.45262419768036
olivain had ready the horses of the young men and the lackeys of the count de gu	25.240234566043434
as a further precaution they had bound his hands	241.21305296019366
the little company started off at a trot on the road to cambrin where they expec	53.35494266597758
but he was no longer there having withdrawn on the previous evening to la bassee	62.1971750652646
deceived by this intelligence he had concentrated his forces between vieillechap	120.74140428742714
he questioned them as to the news they had each been charged to obtain but nothi	103.49817955836546
the hostile army had disappeared two days before and seemed to have gone out of 	57.93724859955429
now an enemy is never so near and consequently so threatening as when he has com	111.80756590779825
the prince was therefore contrary to his custom gloomy and anxious when an offic	107.36704793900088
the duc de grammont received permission from the prince by a glance and went out	58.567556091382755
the prince followed him with his eyes and continued looking at the door no one v	32.4666653212013
suddenly a dull and heavy noise was heard	51.63326748626135
the prince leaped to his feet extending his hand in the direction whence came th	57.084372443202525
every one stood up	182.24697939433736
at that moment the door opened	6.221018685158573
monseigneur said marshal de grammont with a radiant face will your highness perm	64.19698906340619
what eagerly replied the prince will i permit i not only permit i desire let the	166.32672340242672
the marshal introduced the two young men and placed them face to face with the p	54.780303685555864
speak gentlemen said the prince saluting them first speak we shall have time aft	80.61322698923354
the most urgent thing now is to learn where the enemy is and what he is doing	126.06019957529658
it fell naturally to the count de guiche to make reply not only was he the elder	131.8540656015512
besides he had long known the prince whilst raoul now saw him for the first time	58.599485566523285
he therefore narrated to the prince what they had seen from the inn at mazingarb	52.71130357950194
meanwhile raoul closely observed the young general already made so famous by the	300.992722366801
louis de bourbon prince de cond who since the death of his father henri de bourb	23.7669079615496
at the same time he was a man of elegant manners and strong mind so that in addi	21.034918121352447
at the first words of the count de guiche the prince having in mind the directio	32.36899385946697
the enemy was marching upon lens with the intention doubtless of securing posses	124.76360465005375
but in what force was the enemy was it a corps sent out to make a diversion was 	141.12028580133895
now as these questions involved matters of gravest consequence it was these to w	258.93392520758533
raoul conquered the very natural feeling of timidity he experienced and approach	240.1762030290565
my lord he said will you permit me to hazard a few words on that subject which w	26.222486292784303
the prince turned and seemed to cover the young man with a single glance he smil	34.39476121576835
certainly monsieur speak he said softening his stern accented tones as if he wer	85.46408894123489
my lord said raoul blushing might examine the spanish prisoner	87.73311576056152
have you a spanish prisoner cried the prince	48.33607226310426
yes my lord	5.76030617799029
ah that is true said de guiche i had forgotten it	24.092061344519436
that is easily understood it was you who took him count said raoul smiling	70.26853412019648
the old marshal turned toward the viscount grateful for that praise of his son w	117.59322983604837
the young man is right let the prisoner be brought in	47.79017607682247
meanwhile the prince took de guiche aside and asked him how the prisoner had bee	82.60554467704341
monsieur said the prince turning toward raoul i know that you have a letter from	22.38222925744094
my lord said raoul coloring up i did not wish to interrupt your highness in a co	37.246163363422525
but here is the letter	33.75295613610677
very well said the prince give it to me later	21.110012775370265
here is the prisoner let us attend to what is most pressing	76.21592880988408
the prisoner was one of those military adventurers who sold their blood to whoev	50.212478942733
since he had been taken he had not uttered a word so that it was not known to wh	28.125539093413252
the prince looked at him with unspeakable distrust	41.23079185476539
of what country are you asked the prince	32.69628731655174
the prisoner muttered a few words in a foreign tongue	69.37461528510732
ah ah it seems that he is a spaniard	15.40255721189949
do you speak spanish grammont	14.837911841621615
faith my lord but indifferently	68.62355121350093
and i not at all said the prince laughing	47.99290650500982
gentlemen he said turning to those who were near him can any one of you speak sp	70.94271840595994
i can my lord said raoul	23.48941585563397
ah you speak spanish	56.009631250719586
enough i think to fulfill your highnesss wishes on this occasion	87.39303533061931
meanwhile the prisoner had remained impassive and as if he had no understanding 	27.33958201240726
my lord asks of what country you are said the young man in the purest castilian	29.036956306590035
ich bin ein deutscher replied the prisoner	138.92692007382112
what in the devil does he say asked the prince	48.16195606031746
what new gibberish is that	123.90105210711404
he says he is german my lord replied raoul but i doubt it for his accent is bad 	59.96096296418944
then you speak german also asked the prince	85.75077318084604
yes my lord	5.631838782583829
well enough to question him in that language	146.80115713871646
yes my lord	5.626817850425374
question him then	131.9771023979295
raoul began the examination but the result justified his opinion	174.33858480293364
the prisoner did not understand or seemed not to understand what raoul said to h	53.493346183855344
however amidst all the prisoners efforts to elude a systematic examination raoul	121.9182728334343
non siete spagnuolo he said non siete tedesco siete italiano	106.76172270024976
the prisoner started and bit his lips	102.14830655493147
ah that said the prince i understand that language thoroughly and since he is it	66.94591659584822
thank you viscount continued the prince laughing and i appoint you from this mom	53.207648566831274
but the prisoner was not less unwilling to respond in italian than in the other 	50.61487958104983
therefore he knew nothing either of the enemys numbers or of those in command or	104.85679058600337
very good said the prince understanding the reason of that ignorance the man was	51.1031305446634
take him out and shoot him	60.836449395818555
the prisoner turned pale	135.9932545548419
the two soldiers who had brought him in took him each by one arm and led him tow	112.99467551231987
when he reached the threshold of the door the prisoner stopped	18.79190853581633
the soldiers who knew only their orders attempted to force him along	137.05979751451682
one moment said the prisoner in french	44.9322050986801
i am ready to speak my lord	21.4768035447128
ah ah said the prince laughing i thought we should come to that	54.78981265826005
i have a sure method of limbering tongues	108.52755342466737
young men take advantage of it against the time when you may be in command	49.04097081758224
but on condition continued the prisoner that your highness will swear that my li	80.97115957591515
upon my honor said the prince	15.31324715318922
question then my lord	33.65180818207736
where did the army cross the lys	136.25834625690442
between saintvenant and aire	8.856438550671717
by whom is it commanded	96.20291472041858
by count de fuonsaldagna general beck and the archduke	66.08232276846648
of how many does it consist	232.37829880884902
eighteen thousand men and thirtysix cannon	86.0760073989493
and its aim is	1188.2726598653785
you see gentlemen said the prince turning with a triumphant air toward marshal d	81.41565725363456
yes my lord said the marshal you have divined all that was possible to human gen	42.89986565334551
recall le plessis bellievre villequier and derlac said the prince recall all the	43.47965340348781
let them hold themselves in readiness to march tonight	147.87057734511674
tomorrow according to all probability we shall attack the enemy	111.40380337373722
but my lord said marshal de grammont consider that when we have collected all ou	62.38882264808527
monsieur le marechal said the prince with that wonderful glance that was peculia	32.143624573827026
then turning toward the prisoner take away that man he said and keep him careful	118.88841541061069
his life is dependent on the information he has given us if it is true he shall 	48.31722231947448
the prisoner was led away	113.42086029626728
count de guiche said the prince it is a long time since you saw your father rema	18.868629255155387
monsieur he continued addressing raoul if you are not too tired follow me	80.19199787362616
to the end of the world my lord cried raoul feeling an unknown enthusiasm for th	42.36368032333706
the prince smiled he despised flatterers but he appreciated enthusiasts	198.07962757989168
come monsieur he said you are good in council as we have already discovered tomo	41.03896104679698
and i said the marshal what am i to do	31.567486891690518
wait here to receive the troops	84.13684432843219
i shall either return for them myself or shall send a courier directing you to b	145.3997640438851
twenty guards well mounted are all that i shall need for my escort	225.985041091373
that is very few said the marshal	44.423056746926314
it is enough replied the prince	24.540352741506428
have you a good horse monsieur de bragelonne	21.51671880310177
my horse was killed this morning my lord and i am mounted provisionally on my la	82.2412500401069
choose for yourself in my stables the horse you like best	101.86113829843406
no false modesty take the best horse you can find	162.92940875180713
you will need it this evening perhaps you will certainly need it tomorrow	149.2948591869726
raoul did nt wait to be told twice he knew that with superiors especially when t	88.73871947458828
now monsieur he said to raoul will you give me the letter you have brought	24.85384470051767
raoul handed the letter to the prince	31.680583133548478
keep near me said the latter	60.8051856439099
the prince threw his bridle over the pommel of the saddle as he was wo nt to do 	45.92446563245652
the prince read as he hastened on	114.33997799070947
monsieur he said after a moment they tell me great things of you	61.725572304885304
i have only to say after the little that i have seen and heard that i think even	43.73916909249959
raoul bowed	57.41750577770714
meanwhile as the little troop drew nearer to lens the noise of the cannon sounde	52.06698690795337
the prince kept his gaze fixed in the direction of the sound with the steadfastn	30.940225773492863
one would have said that his gaze could pierce the branches of trees which limit	104.38535719664355
from time to time his nostrils dilated as if eager for the smell of powder and h	41.477675948374866
at length they heard the cannon so near that it was evident they were within a l	45.19493795173735
the peasants were in great commotion	216.95245960099197
the report of spanish cruelty had gone out and every one was frightened	81.78292410146857
the women had already fled taking refuge in vitry only a few men remained	237.6490854084714
on seeing the prince they hastened to meet him	45.93090424031574
one of them recognized him	78.3634554252248
ah my lord he said have you come to drive away those rascal spaniards and those 	41.47628161596412
yes said the prince if you will serve me as guide	31.204334237044648
willingly my lord	14.042211623601084
where does your highness wish to go	27.61443470548538
to some elevated spot whence i can look down on lens and the surrounding country	178.32803444880932
in that case i m your man	63.4575434171214
i can trust youyou are a true frenchman	204.28716434449458
i am an old soldier of rocroy my lord	16.846026273148887
here said the prince handing him a purse here is for rocroy	61.08527459026006
now do you want a horse or will you go afoot	54.726233208195055
afoot my lord i have served always in the infantry	54.711021645282905
besides i expect to lead your highness into places where you will have to walk	107.53489906166897
come then said the prince let us lose no time	23.853393645147868
the peasant started off running before the princes horse then a hundred steps fr	150.36358756214779
for a half league they proceeded thus the cannonshot sounding so near that they 	134.2632208603336
at length they entered a path which going out from the road skirted the mountain	64.66995641418687
the prince dismounted ordered one of his aids and raoul to follow his example an	93.5099917783946
he then began to ascend the path	55.68941943340218
in about ten minutes they reached the ruins of an old chateau those ruins crowne	65.34125438635286
at a distance of hardly a quarter of a league they looked down on lens at bay an	50.93519566682201
with a single glance the prince took in the extent of country that lay before hi	108.50499278294811
in a moment the plan of the battle which on the following day was to save france	25.87926448516321
he took a pencil tore a page from his tablets and wrote	56.96168805349982
my dear marshalin an hour lens will be in the enemys possession	37.198737914693545
come and rejoin me bring with you the whole army	148.45555573357376
i shall be at vendin to place it in position	63.14670092966621
tomorrow we shall retake lens and beat the enemy	61.80759779186913
then turning toward raoul go monsieur he said ride fast and give this letter to 	63.510306628822505
raoul bowed took the letter went hastily down the mountain leaped on his horse a	91.4541858878426
a quarter of an hour later he was with the marshal	21.20697949520717
a portion of the troops had already arrived and the remainder was expected from 	69.08691784480058
marshal de grammont put himself at the head of all the available cavalry and inf	33.40402128574047
all the artillery was ready to move and started off at a moments notice	124.56286209627949
it was seven oclock in the evening when the marshal arrived at the appointed pla	19.085435313785027
the prince awaited him there	184.001320116401
as he had foreseen lens had fallen into the hands of the enemy immediately after	52.81441890828144
the event was announced by the cessation of the firing	31.995445880302878
as the shadows of night deepened the troops summoned by the prince arrived in su	69.26464406720663
orders were given that no drum should be beaten no trumpet sounded	329.0340282585337
at nine oclock the night had fully come	47.76206379392681
still a last ray of twilight lighted the plain	95.59222568977258
the army marched silently the prince at the head of the column	66.44568897080207
presently the army came in sight of lens two or three houses were in flames and 	45.920042350167456
the prince assigned to every one his post	191.6264684555409
marshal de grammont was to hold the extreme left resting on mericourt	61.43721543668367
the duc de chatillon commanded the centre	48.00684537269387
finally the prince led the right wing resting on aunay	111.11562091558474
the order of battle on the morrow was to be that of the positions taken in the e	52.735790471191045
each one on awaking would find himself on the field of battle	122.07871508933687
the movement was executed in silence and with precision	96.40988721554584
at ten oclock every one was in his appointed position at halfpast ten the prince	80.55405207043921
three things were especially urged upon the officers who were to see that the so	133.65084567654625
the prince assigned the count de guiche to his father and kept bragelonne near h	30.42250378017234
a tent was erected for them near that of the marshal	155.5261624670401
although the day had been fatiguing neither of them was inclined to sleep	57.383593462857824
and besides even for old soldiers the evening before a battle is a serious time 	201.5905482213844
on the evening before a battle one thinks of a thousand things forgotten till th	146.48768120525628
it need not be said that if in the depths of the heart there is a sentiment more	45.79651612851675
some sentiment of this kind must have been cherished by each one of these two fr	62.05542367408434
the letters were longthe four pages were covered with closely written words	441.87446650888097
the writers sometimes looked up at each other and smiled they understood without	178.58238059300132
the letters being finished each put his own into two envelopes so that no one wi	128.07986059353468
in case any evil should happen to me said bragelonne	52.8836317394477
in case i should be killed said de guiche	34.038899286059284
they then embraced each other like two brothers and each wrapping himself in his	131.6526490226488
chapter xxxv	2.5627088269671905
a dinner in the old style	69.1988836153162
the second interview between the former musketeers was not so formal and threate	83.47627453891208
athos with his superior understanding wisely deemed that the supper table would 	551.4286179484939
for different reasons this was an agreeable proposition to them all and it was t	133.04576778538762
the first rendezvous was fixed for the following wednesday at eight oclock in th	43.02839007845516
on that day in fact the four friends arrived punctually at the hour each from hi	95.02097459440168

they were therefore somewhat surprised to meet altogether at the door of the her	85.89289886767887
the first words exchanged between the four friends on account of the ceremony wh	88.03240645250753

at this order given in athoss habitually calm manner the face of the gascon rela	75.12875513543533
aramis was astonished	148.14087810521036
he knew that athos not only never drank but more that he had a kind of repugnanc	49.65713414365536
this astonishment was doubled when aramis saw athos fill a bumper and toss it of	123.47169082093284
his companions followed his example	151.3268521799524
in a very few minutes the four bottles were empty and this excellent specific su	34.28397289143545

the prince who had a great repugnance to treat with such an illbred fellow made 	72.55640239556733
in this list there were three conditions which displeased mazarin and he offered	96.1118079896146

that i had none as yet but that i was to dine today with two gentlemen who would	70.25292175681766
you told him that said porthos a broad smile spreading over his honest face	67.4092045251636
bravo and you are not afraid of that athos	18.26202523564823

now said aramis tell me a little what you do fear	40.95493027114575
nothing for the present at least nothing in good earnest	120.13334715782894
and with regard to the past asked porthos	79.48606643515694
oh the past is another thing said athos sighing the past and the future	76.3018183593139
are you afraid for your young raoul asked aramis	20.30395349273279
well said dartagnan one is never killed in a first engagement	105.7986885811847
nor in the second said aramis	22.81521907094699
nor in the third returned porthos and even when one is killed one rises again th	127.17018368214724
no said athos it is not raoul about whom i am anxious for i trust he will conduc	28.207507482117627
well asked aramis	13.888942572901497
well i shall look upon it as an expiation	54.0377648520198
ah said dartagnan i know what you mean	13.760154458827813
and i too added aramis but you must not think of that athos what is past is past	70.1284486190554
i do nt understand said porthos	11.288997759785643
the affair at armentieres whispered dartagnan	100.73718258027803
the affair at armentieres asked he again	146.75020580326827
oh yes said porthos true i had forgotten it	41.54951279968087
athos looked at him intently	23.252970250582635
you have forgotten it porthos said he	33.84532080114629
faith yes it is so long ago answered porthos	62.698655017854136
this affair does not then weigh upon your conscience	150.43702521029135
faith no	434.9257319397003
and you dartagnan	67.11410265274667
ii own that when my mind returns to that terrible period i have no recollection 	243.57647193759706
yes yes murmured he i have often felt regret for the victim but never the very s	89.21620032991694
athos shook his dead doubtfully	121.98904385911213
consider said aramis if you admit divine justice and its participation in the th	68.27151499264508
we were but the instruments that is all	121.37580322970354
but as to free will aramis	207.2691583340814
how acts the judge he has a free will yet he fearlessly condemns	376.03626667123245
what does the executioner he is master of his arm yet he strikes without remorse	115.41812247938671
the executioner muttered athos as if arrested by some recollection	195.17846344074158
i know that it is terrible said dartagnan but when i reflect that we have killed	29.361728588306118
as for me said porthos now that you have reminded me of it athos i have the scen	19.383260411228093
milady was there as it were where you sit	196.1684206741426
athos changed color	10993.37380477219
ii was where dartagnan stands	409.33426219130325
i wore a long sword which cut like a damascusyou remember it aramis for you alwa	133.38802826614503
well i swear to you all three that had the executioner of bethunewas he not of b	89.05846805258668
she was a most atrocious woman	42.95299271935294
and then said aramis with the tone of philosophical indifference which he had as	28.58719578113084
i repent of it egad no	363.0566586626966
upon my honor and by the holy cross i only regret it because she was a woman	86.79198927969412
the most satisfactory part of the matter said dartagnan is that there remains no	80.28409084140677
she had a son observed athos	93.59291955124698
oh yes i know that said dartagnan and you mentioned it to me but who knows what 	29.52989547947896
then said athos woe to de winter for the child had done no harm	71.31128271870794
may the devil take me if the child be not dead said porthos	37.89843689039443
there is so much fog in that detestable country at least so dartagnan declares	121.38373256825231
just as the quaint conclusion reached by porthos was about to bring back hilarit	69.402375288564
come in cried athos	52.8254002203118
please your honors said the host a person in a great hurry wishes to speak to on	75.9033710455208
to which of us asked all the four friends	107.13650155305326
to him who is called the comte de la fere	12.157320278366464
it is i said athos and what is the name of the person	13.264766432383496
ah exclaimed athos turning pale	33.770125460259365
back already what can have happened then to bragelonne	137.56336721109955
let him enter cried dartagnan let him come up	45.262592852579544
but grimaud had already mounted the staircase and was waiting on the last step s	64.5085412773638
the door being closed the four friends waited in expectation	102.70073238352181
grimauds agitation his pallor the sweat which covered his face the dust which so	139.76465926703676
your honors said he that woman had a child that child has become a man the tigre	71.1846967869366
athos glanced around at his friends with a melancholy smile	24.36236241154154
porthos turned to look at his sword which was hanging on the wall aramis seized 	19.324063953706663
what do you mean grimaud he exclaimed	11.609187031086407
that miladys son has left england that he is in france on his road to paris if h	32.56810996427267
the devil he is said porthos	30.39526537024538
are you sure of it	7.000073897569881
certain replied grimaud	19.586693178137065
this announcement was received in silence	184.1084802205601
grimaud was so breathless so exhausted that he had fallen back upon a chair	42.45440722454622
athos filled a beaker with champagne and gave it to him	43.68694443225042
well after all said dartagnan supposing that he lives that he comes to paris we 	48.490547182977984
let him come	17.494286501007725
yes echoed porthos glancing affectionately at his sword still hanging on the wal	51.87734088186634
moreover he is but a child said aramis	22.57401786593677
grimaud rose	263.73818667276817
a child he exclaimed	165.2522173136186
do you know what he has done this child disguised as a monk he discovered the wh	54.3109024708279
see it is on fire yet with his hot blood for it is not thirty hours since it was	75.98579227721767
and grimaud threw the dagger on the table	23.272276716613323
dartagnan porthos and aramis rose and in one spontaneous motion rushed to their 	61.7145358992139
athos alone remained seated calm and thoughtful	416.2157463242554
and you say he is dressed as a monk grimaud	26.735279941136074
yes as an augustine monk	133.6704758623616
what sized man is he	309.69179192336003
about my height thin pale with light blue eyes and tawny flaxen hair	87.82788000650413
and he did not see raoul asked athos	19.00962773664011
yes on the contrary they met and it was the viscount himself who conducted him t	62.477002358517844
athos in his turn rising without speaking went and unhooked his sword	106.14983837056666
heigh sir said dartagnan trying to laugh do you know we look very much like a fl	47.433964463157544
it is true said athos but this child comes in the name of heaven	22.306974924234915
and very soon they left the inn	252.52093107466672

the woman must have once been handsome but traces of sorrow have aged her	261.6681662217385
the young girl is lovely and her tears only embellish her the lady appears to be	93.1976777954405

the two women who thus knelt in united prayer were the daughter and granddaughte	191.29588643225986

de winter bowed again unable to reply from excess of emotion	136.61825161046798
on their side the mother and daughter retired into the embrasure of a window to 	65.44312408345904
dear wifewe have now reached the moment of decision	111.4132593972275
i have concentrated here at naseby camp all the resources heaven has left me and	130.89142866714076
here i await the army of my rebellious subjects	88.79704721566212
i am about to struggle for the last time with them	49.328140551219924
if victorious i shall continue the struggle if beaten i am lost	182.29869349849298

the letter bore the signature not of charles king but of charlesstill king	249.56504950709908
and let him be no longer king cried the queen	42.306662199160975
let him be conquered exiled proscribed provided he still lives	221.62497940070674
alas in these days the throne is too dangerous a place for me to wish him to ret	65.50291031699206
but my lord tell me she continued hide nothing from mewhat is in truth the kings	126.57790680034529
alas madame more hopeless than he thinks	274.4741806074553
his majesty has so good a heart that he can not understand hatred is so loyal th	50.560857973955486
but lord montrose replied the queen i have heard of his great and rapid successe	53.5793376279367
i heard it said that he was marching to the frontier to join the king	32.4539499136549
yes madame but on the frontier he was met by lesly he had tried victory by means	98.60793295694293

here monsieur mazarin is everything	70.96836475869635
does he desire to play the part in france that cromwell plays in england	64.69182357048636
oh no he is a subtle conscienceless italian who though he very likely dreams of 	98.87777269071559
more reason then he should protect a king pursued by parliament	203.44900471233007
the queen shook her head despairingly	39.87321152650947
if i judge for myself my lord she said the cardinal will do nothing and will eve	66.38197178841646
the presence of my daughter and myself in france is already irksome to him much 	103.464181768584
my lord added henrietta with a melancholy smile it is sad and almost shameful to	39.47091417524404
horrible cried de winter the daughter of henry iv	33.34969433234018
and the wife of king charles wherefore did you not apply then madame to the firs	77.56107074697873

mazarin took the letter and read it thus	26.51524828573271
mordaunt one of my secretaries will remit this letter of introduction to his emi	54.98948949917665
he is also the bearer of a second confidential epistle for his eminence	83.99185689748107
oliver cromwell	14.667492630241894

the young man drew from his pocket a second letter presented it to the cardinal 	19.41936809807156
the cardinal however did not unseal the letter at once but continued to turn it 	75.79020587815538
you are very young monsieur mordaunt for this difficult task of ambassador in wh	111.67073934106176

mazarin now understood that cromwells envoy desired to retain his incognito	253.32861490745063
he was silent for an instant and during that time he scanned the young man even 	46.855138401141446
the messenger was unmoved	313.4919391519236
devil take these puritans said mazarin aside they are carved from granite	173.96116301037677
then he added aloud but you have relations left you	112.356175692265
i have one remaining	146.61325683196952
three times i presented myself to ask his support and three times he ordered his	131.71179812224656
oh mon dieu my dear mr	13.358397382908937
mordaunt said mazarin hoping by a display of affected pity to catch the young ma	98.92752697336763

you have a good memory said mazarin	13.418471692077416
oh yes my lord said the young man with such peculiar emphasis that the cardinal 	15.160686368316911
and who brought you up he asked again	155.38309824689134
a french nurse who sent me away when i was five years old because no one paid he	74.79272572949887
what became of you	272.6742332073937
as i was weeping and begging on the high road a minister from kingston took me i	61.66802810567936
and these researches	1695.5992420392906
were fruitless chance did everything	3708.758463407753
you discovered what had become of your mother	127.65610415425236
i learned that she had been assassinated by my relation aided by four friends bu	94.17484813762572
oh i now understand why you are in the service of cromwell you hate the king	41.3800476694939
yes my lord i hate him said the young man	10.31997576152989
mazarin marked with surprise the diabolical expression with which the young man 	88.13220061659844
just as ordinarily faces are colored by blood his face seemed dyed by hatred and	151.80855206835835
your history is a terrible one mr	61.856865395517616
mordaunt and touches me keenly but happily for you you serve an allpowerful mast	246.6643504041734
my lord to a wellbred dog it is only necessary to show one end of a track he is 	71.4364246219717

thanks my lord i will speak to him myself	19.322912184064837
he will treat me better the next time i see him	59.82256795692372
you have the means then of touching him	130.01341458890136
i have the means of making myself feared	130.9972629863002
mazarin looked at the young man but at the fire which shot from his glance he be	45.70110942448988
the young mans eyes gradually resumed their dull and glassy appearance and he fe	74.47073340768723
after reading the first lines of the letter mazarin gave a side glance at him to	50.46796591140625
observing his indifference he shrugged his shoulders saying	143.48820027966426
send on your business those who do theirs at the same time let us see what this 	53.46057893820937
we here present the letter verbatim	363.2616893188359
to his eminence monseigneur le cardinal mazarini	106.14614345320454
i have wished monseigneur to learn your intentions relating to the existing stat	96.81921328965531
the two kingdoms are so near that france must be interested in our situation as 	84.84879260930555
the english are almost of one mind in contending against the tyranny of charles 	97.53973173370439
placed by popular confidence at the head of that movement i can appreciate bette	114.68709732277384

france has already received queen henrietta and unintentionally doubtless has ma	389.672359441908
but madame henrietta is a daughter of france and was entitled to the hospitality	39.12173481739634
as to king charles the question must be viewed differently in receiving and aidi	119.75763700746217
at this moment mazarin became very uneasy at the turn which the letter was takin	41.00008627893181
the latter continued in thought	449.1297069367523
mazarin resumed his reading	183.3071285161703
it is important therefore monseigneur that i should be informed as to the intent	83.99850553338085
the interests of that kingdom and those of england though taking now diverse dir	184.2910856384544
england needs tranquillity at home in order to consummate the expulsion of her k	73.67637123171649
you need as much as we do that interior condition of repose which thanks to the 	166.40922705055982
your quarrels with the parliament your noisy dissensions with the princes who fi	130.6866841448113
i have therefore believed monseigneur knowing your prudence and your personal re	287.374884852917
that neutrality consists simply in excluding king charles from the territory of 	248.8888465116885
my letter is private and confidential and for that reason i send it to you by a 	92.68134162025501

oliver cromwell considered it more expedient to declare himself to a mind as int	55.85638015127668
farewell monseigneur should i not receive a reply in the space of fifteen days i	99.84496388914695
oliver cromwell	14.870936975363286
mordaunt said the cardinal raising his voice as if to arouse the dreamer my repl	33.02167781947406
i promise my lord replied mordaunt but how many days does your eminence expect m	71.74594738061779
if you do not receive it in ten days you can leave	24.81934009602839
mordaunt bowed	101.87197024651478
that is not all sir continued mazarin your private adventures have touched me to	73.43695256733501
cromwell makes you an important person as ambassador come tell me what can i do 	120.93627660465481
mordaunt reflected a moment and after some hesitation was about to speak when be	109.86073352413247
my lord the queen henrietta maria accompanied by an english noble is entering th	112.84342773981913
mazarin made a bound from his chair which did not escape the attention of the yo	27.742039457657945
sir said the cardinal you have heard me i fix on boulogne because i presume that	36.648743944661405

i do not wish you to be seen leaving our interview must be kept secret	127.7643789936141
mordaunt followed bernouin who led him through the adjacent chamber and left him	48.676341416500115

henrietta maria and mazarin	9.621275193240326
the cardinal rose and advanced in haste to receive the queen of england	35.250307435455724
he showed the more respect to this queen deprived of every mark of pomp and stri	111.64294694841658
but supplicants for favor know how to accommodate the expression of their featur	267.08891942757117
smiled as she advanced to meet a man she hated and despised	138.93579725680777
ah said mazarin to himself what a sweet face does she come to borrow money of me	71.36428043112069
and he threw an uneasy glance at his strong box he even turned inside the bevel 	140.40143207840353
your eminence said the august visitor it was my first intention to speak of the 	54.43501519175202
madame said mazarin your majesty overwhelms me with flattering distinction	47.82220412943029
he is very gracious thought the queen can he have guessed my errand	173.5023855793962
give continued the cardinal your commands to the most respectful of your servant	109.39475859380525
alas sir replied the queen i have lost the habit of commanding and have adopted 	34.97567882777571
i am here to petition you too happy should my prayer be favorably heard	241.3298258532493
i am listening madame with the greatest interest said mazarin	62.423430689589075
your eminence it concerns the war which the king my husband is now sustaining ag	86.96420003086037
you are perhaps ignorant that they are fighting in england added she with a mela	45.42708282544818
i am completely ignorant of it madame said the cardinal accompanying his words w	54.59347705353902
well then your eminence said the queen i must inform you that charles i	19.85433544869759
my husband is on the eve of a decisive engagement	51.523440895906056
in case of a check mazarin made a slight movement one must foresee everything in	101.72760659522663
what do you say to this project	14.513584425035766
the cardinal had listened without permitting a single fibre of his face to betra	60.53244212605252
do you think madame that france agitated and disturbed as it is would be a safe 	54.544220336064356
support a double weight	289.4537288219175
the weight was not so heavy when i was in peril interrupted the queen with a sad	70.46472085554268
oh you madame the cardinal hastened to say in order to cut short the explanation	174.34174381393692
a daughter of henry iv	33.67090082777503
of that great that sublime sovereign	426.7574261195266

if anything yet remains of that great that sublime king henry of whom you have j	139.38742551064217
the perspiration stood in large drops on mazarins brow	122.94435016862124
that admiration is on the contrary so great so real madame returned mazarin with	117.07770817986447
whom heaven protect from evilcame into france i would offer him my housemy own h	195.04300296094354
some day the people will burn that house as they burned that of the marechal dan	86.05191780233602
poor concino concini and yet he but desired the good of the people	84.66688167555535
yes my lord like yourself said the queen ironically	45.33686647965192
mazarin pretended not to understand the double meaning of his own sentence but c	70.7710120094899
well then your eminence said the queen becoming impatient what is your answer	57.137993692973815
madame cried mazarin more and more moved will your majesty permit me to give you	38.91889829288395
speak sir replied the queen the counsels of so prudent a man as yourself ought c	81.66095410505865
madame believe me the king ought to defend himself to the last	79.594881430027
he has done so sir and this last battle which he encounters with resources much 	182.26740253955165
well madame in that case my advicei know that i am very bold to offer advice to 	50.25213251949777
absent kings are very soon forgotten if he passes over into france his cause is 	257.2276696654889
but persisted the queen if such be your advice and you have his interest at hear	165.13532185547632
if i had had a single ornament left i should have bought wood this winter to mak	205.72561833919377
oh madame said mazarin your majesty knows not what you ask	43.81153824676525
on the day when foreign succor follows in the train of a king to replace him on 	127.75237776503258
to the point sir said the queen to the point and answer me yes or no if the king	54.739256412775156
madame said the cardinal affecting an effusive frankness of speech i shall convi	46.37588454171002
after which your majesty will i think no longer doubt my zeal in your behalf	113.51018694966496
the queen bit her lips and moved impatiently on her chair	48.86087875264003
well what do you propose to do she said at length come speak	56.57211873887987
i will go this instant and consult the queen and we will refer the affair at onc	61.925480814299995
with which you are at waris it not so you will charge broussel to report it	100.3939803860072
enough sir enough	449.841072492076
i understand you or rather i am wrong	53.896847645681156
go to the parliament for it was from this parliament the enemy of monarchs that 	84.91436160386333
whom you so much admire received the only relief this winter which prevented her	390.90697643581706
and with these words henrietta rose in majestic indignation whilst the cardinal 	66.01989844658623
but queen henrietta without even turning toward him who made these hypocritical 	488.13862909635696
poor queen already fallen though all bowed before her as etiquette required she 	664.9719718145749
it signifies little said mazarin when he was alone	64.04286175724984
it gave me pain and it was an ungracious part to play but i have said nothing ei	59.9489271023281
bernouin entered	255.6511207511771
see if the young man with the black doublet and the short hair who was with me j	52.644726116461975
bernouin went out and soon returned with comminges who was on guard	36.53460617671086
your eminence said comminges as i was reconducting the young man for whom you ha	29.001885070559883
he reflected for a second and then descended the stairs	79.51131311586751
i believe i saw him mount a gray horse and leave the palace court	160.5165855541757
but is not your eminence going to the queen	59.2527329628785
for what purpose	26.34858355084399
monsieur de guitant my uncle has just told me that her majesty had received news	45.49573605436736
it is well i will go	15.343243595478786
comminges had seen rightly and mordaunt had really acted as he had related	91.74385692919319
in crossing the gallery parallel to the large glass gallery he perceived de wint	189.28398674193915
at this sight the young man stopped short not in admiration of raphaels picture 	50.01285551608425
his eyes dilated and a shudder ran through his body	49.03421314619727
one would have said that he longed to break through the wall of glass which sepa	37.356716594890024
but he stopped doubtless to reflect for instead of allowing his first impulse wh	178.86113900335192
he had not long to wait for the queen scarcely remained a quarter of an hour wit	41.76111075832749
at last the heavy machine which was called a chariot in those days came out rumb	113.10194771921522
the horses started on a trot and took the road to the louvre which they entered	29.76524808293078
before leaving the convent of the carmelites henrietta had desired her daughter 	44.532249157019315
mordaunt followed the carriage and when he had watched it drive beneath the somb	44.97446502716864
chapter xxxix	2.703934681431499
how sometimes the unhappy mistake chance for providence	414.88121424966033
well madame said de winter when the queen had dismissed her attendants	55.46519203074097
well my lord what i foresaw has come to pass	98.72541163832655
what does the cardinal refuse to receive the king france refuse hospitality to a	73.17545358030057
i did not say france my lord i said the cardinal and the cardinal is not even a 	24.866167114730793
but did you see the queen	28.836725093821823
it is useless replied henrietta the queen will not say yes when the cardinal say	43.23261231733458
are you not aware that this italian directs everything both indoors and out and 	65.57519492647539
he was embarrassed whilst speaking to me and yet quite firm in his determination	167.88329764052492
then did you not observe the agitation in the palais royal the passing to and fr	58.68950125791343
not from england madame	227.6255490379598
i made such haste that i am certain of not having been forestalled	84.42728865088874
i set out three days ago passing miraculously through the puritan army and i too	87.93712800495092
besides the king i am certain awaits your majestys reply before risking anything	243.439225677111
you will tell him my lord resumed the queen despairingly that i can do nothing t	33.05112014201828
i shall go and die by his side	42.501520516207414
madame madame exclaimed de winter your majesty abandons yourself to despair and 	72.24662142819714
no friends left my lord no other friends left in the wide world but yourself oh 	298.15592178868286
i hope not madame replied de winter thoughtfully i once spoke to you of four men	68.79178589642184
what can be done with four	66.07750183675633
four devoted resolute men can do much assure yourself madame and those of whom i	213.14797378532356
and where are these four men	40.01606453187946
ah that is what i do not know	8.901235864934984
it is twenty years since i saw them and yet whenever i have seen the king in dan	28.391541617772784
and these men were your friends	77.80473344335398
one of them held my life in his hands and gave it to me	26.326655964555208
i know not whether he is still my friend but since that time i have remained his	45.97342388982426
and these men are in france my lord	34.17562727640426
i believe so	88.68267123991654
tell me their names perhaps i may have heard them mentioned and might be able to	84.18616573514177
one of them was called the chevalier dartagnan	34.571743940133906
ah my lord if i mistake not the chevalier dartagnan is lieutenant of royal guard	79.25603213155557
that would be a misfortune said de winter and i shall begin to think that we are	36.503174695746104
but the others said the queen who clung to this last hope as a shipwrecked man c	97.4415973231123
the others my lord	138.84764681476818
the secondi heard his name by chance for before fighting us these four gentlemen	263.8949304005795
as for the two others i had so much the habit of calling them by nicknames that 	50.970680344589596
oh mon dieu it is a matter of the greatest urgency to find them out said the que	24.816499910484243
oh yes said de winter for they are the same men	32.68497814401237
listen madame and recall your remembrances	302.81855929804914
have you never heard that queen anne of austria was once saved from the greatest	69.91799366365821
yes at the time of her relations with monsieur de buckingham it had to do in som	53.182283230941955
well it was that affair madame these men are the ones who saved her and i smile 	146.9667310251306
well then my lord they must be found but what can four men or rather three men d	55.2919914772134
it will be one valiant sword the less but there will remain still three without 	320.5132723786695
seek then my lord seek these gentlemen and if they will consent to go with you t	53.998252398208024
seek them my lord and find them i conjure you	72.55674837227949
i will search for them madame said de winter and doubtless i shall find them but	42.66295357883983
has your majesty forgotten that the king expects your reply and awaits it in ago	110.03479172099709
then indeed we are lost cried the queen in the fullness of a broken heart	51.01312188352253
at this moment the door opened and the young henrietta appeared then the queen w	15.23393528898174
but that act of selfcontrol effective as it was did not escape the eyes of the y	58.35814234657178
she stopped on the threshold breathed a sigh and addressing the queen	59.54588367071215
why then do you always weep mother when i am away from you she said	109.91271241128582
the queen smiled but instead of answering	71.69871735750912
see de winter she said i have at least gained one thing in being only half a que	83.48097161261983
then turning toward her daughter	96.99254066298461
what do you want henrietta she demanded	21.2100791342526
my mother replied the young princess a cavalier has just entered the louvre and 	45.80517550814821
ah said the queen to de winter he is one of my faithful adherents but do you not	21.618743968766033
madame have pity on me exclaimed de winter you wring my heart	140.28412018482894
and who is this cavalier henrietta asked the queen	23.563995766511066
i saw him from the window madame he is a young man that appears scarce sixteen y	55.11136861796028
the queen smiling made a sign with her head the young princess opened the door a	52.108204406963004
advancing a few steps toward the queen he knelt down	27.474096836273002
madame said he i bear to your majesty a letter from my friend the count de guich	33.41576249003466
at the name of the count de guiche a blush spread over the cheeks of the young p	14.452383323682973
you told me that the letter was from the marechal de grammont henrietta said the	20.945698395690567
i thought so madame stammered the young girl	53.80286760566259
it is my fault madame said raoul	8.889395392755771
i did announce myself in truth as coming on the part of the marechal de grammont	52.555823819327
there has been fighting then asked the queen motioning to raoul to rise	58.80628816338849
yes madame said the young man	5.882838676055265

the comte de la fere madame replied the young man bowing	9.94215625397794
de winter made a gesture of surprise and the queen turned to him with a start of	20.17015496346149
the comte de la fere she cried	13.391305917768744
have you not mentioned that name to me	33.82583085741707
as for de winter he could scarcely believe that he had heard aright	37.0810129642522
the comte de la fere he cried in his turn	10.49583355868499
oh sir reply i entreat youis not the comte de la fere a noble whom i remember ha	73.82917641113215
who must be now about fortyseven or fortyeight years of age	54.340291083594494

and who served under an assumed name	524.2022256973147
under the name of athos	8.334414570259236
latterly i heard his friend monsieur dartagnan give him that name	92.51289512273404
that is it madame that is the same	19.724651935754604

raoul bent respectfully before the two princesses and bowing to de winter depart	161.2931988646097
the queen and de winter continued to converse for some time in low voices in ord	82.13108859860552
then when de winter rose to take leave	156.1919144696273
listen my lord said the queen i have preserved this diamond cross which came fro	77.62755947823221
michael which came from my husband	354.897506213589
they are worth about fifty thousand pounds	48.81208074715389
i had sworn to die of hunger rather than part with these precious pledges but no	148.6246255759667
take them and if you need money for your expedition sell them fearlessly my lord	109.67262062585183
but should you find the means of retaining them remember my lord that i shall es	51.86313139658552
madame replied de winter your majesty will be served by a man devoted to you	29.887788041001183

in an hour hence i shall be with the comte de la fere and tomorrow your majesty 	18.45034685312384

uncle and nephew	335.5686032101582
the horse and servant belonging to de winter were waiting for him at the door he	82.66981376579642
it was then that he saw a horseman as it were detach himself from the wall and f	35.43462391370425
in leaving the palais royal he remembered to have observed a similar shadow	88.05793224300268
tony he said motioning to his groom to approach	68.75561427440992
here i am my lord	23.765570711678834
did you remark that man who is following us	76.58135454611319
yes my lord	5.539657408073802
who is he	28.090262687395487
i do not know only he has followed your grace from the palais royal stopped at t	55.77741176811275
some spy of the cardinal said de winter to him aside	78.9981051133168
let us pretend not to notice that he is watching us	93.67806496342052
and spurring on he plunged into the labyrinth of streets which led to his hotel 	127.80727584689849
the unknown spurred his horse to a gallop	91.70908475080816
de winter dismounted at his hotel and went up into his apartment intending to wa	61.35998236890961
he turned around and mordaunt stood before him	45.586822839187576
there was a moment of frozen silence between these two	40.321674859060735
sir said de winter i thought i had already made you aware that i am weary of thi	23.884323026256713
i am not your uncle i know you not	35.05503784750309
my uncle replied mordaunt with his harsh and bantering tone you are mistaken you	44.689226142378125
as for denying that i am your nephew you will think twice about it now that i ha	67.20652544124792
and how does it concern me what you have learned said de winter	36.905656075550304
oh it concerns you very closely my uncle i am sure and you will soon be of my op	67.04408573272549
when i presented myself before you for the first time in london it was to ask yo	39.06620192698223
de winter shrank back from the fire of those scorching eyes	79.4607519911369
your mother he said	38.816380105558814
yes my lord my mother replied the young man advancing into the room until he was	16.129957741232833
i have asked the headsman of bethune he said his voice hoarse and his face livid	66.04666249975634
and the headsman of bethune gave me a reply	52.54593835440713
de winter fell back in a chair as though struck by a thunderbolt and in vain att	45.92971062070456
yes continued the young man all is now explained with this key i open the abyss	85.21618523680212
my mother inherited an estate from her husband you have assassinated her my name	54.1271736684625
i am no longer astonished that you knew me not	37.09257853709784
i am not surprised that you refused to recognize me	39.074632104494896
when a man is a robber it is hard to call him nephew whom he has impoverished wh	100.03539397441557
these words produced a contrary effect to that which mordaunt had anticipated	88.3167980906618
de winter remembered the monster that milady had been he rose dignified and calm	138.91307545048994
you desire to fathom this horrible secret said de winter well then so be it	140.2462640359887
know then what manner of woman it was for whom today you call me to account	148.75657270561797
that woman had in all probability poisoned my brother and in order to inherit fr	48.380322453007
i have proof of it	42.79577776636673
what say you to that	67.1448641008421
i say that she was my mother	31.594065826829194
she caused the unfortunate duke of buckingham to be stabbed by a man who was ere	48.42722246690376
what say you to that crime of which i have the proof	67.91924432920779
she was my mother	40.42804338534178
on our return to france she had a young woman who was attached to one of her opp	28.443819841447187
will this crime persuade you of the justice of her punishmentfor of all this i h	82.3914654816815
she was my mother cried the young man who uttered these three successive exclama	45.42266413086513
at last charged with murders with debauchery hated by every one and yet threaten	294.73682513108014
depraved as a girl adulterous as a wife an unnatural sister homicide poisoner ex	131.35742699824098
a sob which mordaunt could not repress burst from his throat and his livid face 	88.19235849602252
silence sir she was my mother her crimes i know them not her disorders i know th	104.68068998740061
but this i know that i had a mother that five men leagued against one woman murd	89.095336505648
i know that you were one of them my uncle and that you cried louder than the oth	40.92934573072892
therefore i warn you and listen well to my words that they may be engraved upon 	84.58081130535633
with hatred in his eyes foaming at his mouth and his fist extended mordaunt had 	50.50626785571414
the latter put his hand to his sword and said with the smile of a man who for th	20.19814797261632
would you assassinate me sir then i shall recognize you as my nephew for you wou	35.9327560197241
no replied mordaunt forcing his features and the muscles of his body to resume t	48.52887563395441
but when i have found them then tremble sir	103.1925519780295
i stabbed to the heart the headsman of bethune without mercy or pity and he was 	109.26729318928234
with these words the young man went out and descended the stairs with sufficient	46.83330392020943
but de winter did not call crushed enfeebled he remained standing and with liste	140.48902818734493
my god i thank thee that he knows me only	80.47162549870171
chapter xli	3.0395601376213794
paternal affection	1742.149351478645
whilst this terrible scene was passing at lord de winters athos seated near his 	56.32821930488421
listening to the relation of those emotions so fresh and pure the fine noble fac	129.90645484794678
he forgot all that was dark in the past and that was cloudy in the future	50.459038585544626
it almost seemed as if the return of this much loved boy had changed his fears t	167.43903201371344
athos was happyhappy as he had never been before	55.81979647465353
and you assisted and took part in this great battle bragelonne cried the former 	314.53513024353913
yes sir	25.09666397974696
and it was a fierce one	52.65837134416829
his highness the prince charged eleven times in person	146.14629979382696
he is a great commander bragelonne	31.021942199731043
he is a hero sir	45.549981817678656
i did not lose sight of him for an instant	24.976897503382993
oh how fine it is to be called cond and to be so worthy of such a name	41.68820237348861
he was calm and radiant was he not	49.21781894374854
as calm as at parade radiant as at a fete	156.55803040396907
when we went up to the enemy it was slowly we were forbidden to draw first and w	60.78422647068637
when we arrived about thirty paces from them the prince turned around to the sol	62.0289459773908
there was such dead silence that friends and enemies could have heard these word	146.96799245611479
well very good you will do as much when the opportunity occurs will you raoul	105.85783103593647
i know not sir but i thought it really very fine and grand	82.87710727024077
were you afraid raoul asked the count	12.832227152949667
yes sir replied the young man naively i felt a great chill at my heart and at th	22.088803229270905
in honest truth raoul said athos pressing his hand	73.63671829429039
yes sir at that instant there was such a rataplan of musketry that one might hav	55.408358259930296
those who were not killed felt the heat of the flames	58.13264902185626
i opened my eyes astonished to find myself alive and even unhurt a third of the 	95.08107403118059
at that moment i encountered the eye of the prince	28.15923504176818
i had but one thought and that was that he was observing me	46.74089664292579
i spurred on and found myself in the enemys ranks	237.45799158321125
and the prince was pleased with you	98.04465054420398
he told me so at least sir when he desired me to return to paris with monsieur d	45.40126986732808
go said he the enemy will not rally for fifteen days and until that time i have 	55.58308949641053
go and see those whom you love and who love you and tell my sister de longuevill	80.65690595636289
and i came sir added raoul gazing at the count with a smile of real affection fo	37.01262177814862
athos drew the young man toward him and pressed his lips to his brow as he would	30.527858491316547
and now raoul said he you are launched you have dukes for friends a marshal of f	85.07290757578193
oh sir said raoul suddenly you recall something which in my haste to relate my e	91.70466809692851
what is his name	10.040922543157352
i did not venture to ask sir he spoke elegantly although i thought from his acce	87.8617252402505
ah said athos leaning down his head as if to remember who it could be	31.131621690206714
then when he raised it again he was struck by the presence of a man who was stan	17.56316337402156
lord de winter exclaimed the count	17.469582662415295
athos my friend	30.328277445995134
and the two gentlemen were for an instant locked in each others arms then athos 	94.75068061913997
what ails you my lord you appear as unhappy as i am the reverse	36.94744854579276
yes truly dear friend and i may even say the sight of you increases my dismay	83.17141197478213
and de winter glancing around him raoul quickly understood that the two friends 	90.25963181646677
come now that we are alone said athos let us talk of yourself	26.068163209476666
whilst we are alone let us speak of ourselves replied de winter	30.920904789986874
he is here	43.720694170868065
miladys son	1190.4759898722955
athos again struck by this name which seemed to pursue him like an echo hesitate	112.44627237933757
i know it grimaud met him between bethune and arras and then came here to warn m	73.8439285680527
does grimaud know him then	86.06197141380767
no but he was present at the deathbed of a man who knew him	27.160326817495218
the headsman of bethune exclaimed de winter	68.95579668398709
you know about that cried athos astonished	48.0874909301867
he has just left me replied de winter after telling me all	55.657483188394444
ah my friend what a horrible scene why did we not destroy the child with the mot	100.11207820427894
what need you fear said athos recovering from the instinctive fear he had at fir	66.0001944438397
de winter smiled sorrowfully and shook his head	59.34151667390449
do you not know the race said he	19.618688949838475
pooh said athos trying to smile in his turn	13.313457907142089
it must have lost its ferocity in the second generation	130.41669776238828
besides my friend providence has warned us that we may be on our guard	65.61895441747214
all we can now do is to wait	99.78237664125163
let us wait and as i said before let us speak of yourself	62.67653510481776
what brings you to paris	59.70954224210606
affairs of importance which you shall know later	204.78564277675602
but what is this that i hear from her majesty the queen of england monsieur dart	55.04214029991788
i neither hate nor blame the cardinal and your opinions will be held ever sacred	389.55791712992556
but do you happen to belong to him	38.12425837938625
monsieur dartagnan replied athos is in the service he is a soldier and obeys all	27.8139695653512
monsieur dartagnan is not rich and has need of his position as lieutenant to ena	69.27085360126621
millionaires like yourself my lord are rare in france	108.37670369703307
alas said de winter i am at this moment as poor as he is if not poorer	40.75981527201235
but to return to our subject	105.76771758517245
well then you wish to know if i am of mazarins party no	40.267136297824656
pardon my frankness too my lord	127.0261858914526
i am obliged to you count for this pleasing intelligence you make me young and h	68.30560795413646
ah so you are not a mazarinist delightful indeed you could not belong to him	76.84469097024008
but pardon me are you free i mean to ask if you are married	87.51401017128171
ah as to that no replied athos laughing	47.83205621462071
because that young man so handsome so elegant so polished	132.19616005236102
is a child i have adopted and who does not even know who was his father	63.77313935596858
very well you are always the same athos great and generous	85.87848323963668
are you still friends with monsieur porthos and monsieur aramis	34.596851605694916
add monsieur dartagnan my lord	22.966437667846417
we still remain four friends devoted to each other but when it becomes a questio	92.61560440995133
is monsieur aramis with dartagnan asked lord de winter	36.72071740005935
no said athos monsieur aramis does me the honor to share my opinions	52.55924469841626
could you put me in communication with your witty and agreeable friend is he muc	110.31575229771865
he has become an abb that is all	59.11712835843591
you alarm me his profession must have made him renounce any great undertakings	199.6677432294212
on the contrary said athos smiling he has never been so much a musketeer as sinc	25.930675374531585
could you engage to bring him to me tomorrow morning at ten oclock on the pont d	38.28694353574981
oh oh exclaimed athos smiling you have a duel in prospect	33.75569233983321
yes count and a splendid duel too a duel in which i hope you will take your part	61.64712426263554
where are we to go my lord	23.083827434530004
to her majesty the queen of england who has desired me to present you to her	25.462552495537242
this is an enigma said athos but it matters not since you know the solution of i	43.19798282758637
will your lordship do me the honor to sup with me	44.50507712225516
thanks count no replied de winter	135.65659912487564
i own to you that that young mans visit has subdued my appetite and probably wil	125.40771487906562
what undertaking can have brought him to paris it was not to meet me that he cam	42.15051652012177
this young man terrifies me my lord there lies in him a sanguinary predispositio	83.02523771497299
what occupies him in england	109.92702139967713
he is one of cromwells most enthusiastic disciples	59.64352435540381
but what attached him to the cause his father and mother were catholics i believ	106.89197373453425
his hatred of the king who deprived him of his estates and forbade him to bear t	49.41014575190455
and what name does he now bear	145.90078640629957
a puritan yet disguised as a monk he travels alone in france	161.87160127993212
do you say as a monk	31.740045096113338
it was thus and by mere accidentmay god pardon me if i blasphemethat he heard th	100.0497051759028
then i understand it all he has been sent by cromwell to mazarin and the queen g	20.483485744098893
everything is clear to me now	68.80018384378326
adieu count till tomorrow	171.88231968617683
but the night is dark said athos perceiving that lord de winter seemed more unea	60.09308721457536
i have tony a safe if simple youth	321.1723520968174
halloo there grimaud olivain and blaisois call the viscount and take the musket 	72.2617809628467
blaisois was the tall youth half groom half peasant whom we saw at the chateau d	148.33434347307144
viscount said athos to raoul as he entered you will conduct my lord as far as hi	40.4449437273705
oh count said de winter for whom do you take me	32.60927409243552
for a stranger who does not know paris said athos and to whom the viscount will 	44.68051141341607
de winter shook him by the hand	55.69866126518027
grimaud said athos put yourself at the head of the troop and beware of the monk	36.37571551442057
grimaud shuddered and nodding awaited the departure regarding the butt of his mu	54.817669860277114
then obeying the orders given him by athos he headed the small procession bearin	144.73266118771707
the same order was followed in returning nor did grimauds searching glance disco	346.301763243551
he fancied also that in going he had already observed the street watcher who had	140.61086951835603
he pushed on toward him but before he could reach it the shadow had disappeared 	80.03625084997087
the next day on awaking the count perceived raoul by his bedside	28.34983419024461
the young man was already dressed and was reading a new book by m	50.16048932680038
already up raoul exclaimed the count	66.95737768272427
yes sir replied raoul with slight hesitation i did not sleep well	33.29213770875161
you raoul not sleep well then you must have something on your mind said athos	62.93834820175578
sir you will perhaps think that i am in a great hurry to leave you when i have o	22.230924136535158
have you only two days of leave raoul	51.059664573458626
on the contrary sir i have ten nor is it to the camp i wish to go	50.53181461726963
where then said athos smiling if it be not a secret	36.80430789136511
you are now almost a man since you have made your first passage of arms and have	93.29407378424268
never sir said raoul as long as i possess the happiness of having you for a prot	23.24586954766285
i have however a wish to go and pass a day at blois	56.00562527297658
you look at me and you are going to laugh at me	22.469193325152215
no on the contrary i am not inclined to laugh said athos suppressing a sigh	27.207736624136523
you wish to see blois again it is but natural	49.489750372173006
then you permit me to go you are not angry in your heart exclaimed raoul joyousl	42.8910396894848
certainly and why should i regret what gives you pleasure	126.24017761229642
oh how kind you are exclaimed the young man pressing his guardians hand and i ca	41.86472825074545
when you like raoul	58.99685461411148
sir said raoul as he turned to leave the room i have thought of one thing and th	29.911134162344066
and you ought to thank her raoul	93.87580048419457
well try the hotel de luynes raoul and ask if the duchess can receive you	93.01489730897785
i am glad to see you pay attention to the usages of the world	39.306656114182445
you must take grimaud and olivain	34.45842197290933
both sir asked raoul astonished	78.15813380571763
raoul went out and when athos heard his young joyous voice calling to grimaud an	63.48569044832375
it is very soon to leave me he thought but he follows the common custom	89.75572109897236
nature has made us thus she makes the young look ever forward not behind	403.9731823691086
he certainly likes the child but will he love me less as his affection grows for	258.9376293135909
and athos confessed to himself that he was unprepared for so prompt a departure 	92.05924408752628
everything was ready at ten oclock for the departure and as athos was watching r	37.20096406773252
he was charged to tell the comte de la fere that she had learned of the return o	25.999644547257464
tell her grace replied athos that the viscount has just mounted his horse to pro	68.11104793125766
then with renewed instructions to grimaud athos signified to raoul that he could	68.7651554387896
chapter xlii	2.832311691257366
another queen in want of help	444.2910620129901
athos had not failed to send early to aramis and had given his letter to blaisoi	35.2006644403564
blaisois found bazin donning his beadles gown his services being required that d	235.7942885886953
athos had desired blaisois to try to speak to aramis himself	42.68280306616981
blaisois a tall simple youth who understood nothing but what he was expressly to	113.29183694700706
blaisois seeing bazin in clerical guise was a little discomposed at his denials 	87.21585809326137
but bazin still the servant of a musketeer when once the blood mounted to his fa	75.52194778436751
you have insulted the church my friend you have insulted the church	56.29452085701656
at this moment aramis aroused by this unusual disturbance cautiously opened the 	59.07981757904956
from the comte de la fere said aramis	8.390134897050013
all right	104.74644953503628
and he retired into his room without even asking the cause of so much noise	84.02626727084521
blaisois returned disconsolate to the hotel of the grand roi charlemagne and whe	31.226117818510215
you foolish fellow said athos laughing	188.7493349453422
and you did not tell him that you came from me	17.085638200244066
no sir	40.61505277091788
at ten oclock athos with his habitual exactitude was waiting on the pont du louv	18.184423678829347
they waited ten minutes and then his lordship began to fear aramis was not comin	49.8173275083704
patience said athos whose eyes were fixed in the direction of the rue du bac pat	12.929563453297003
it was indeed aramis	15.514210947468822
having run against a young shopkeeper who was gaping at the crows and who had sp	57.39440271949683
at this moment one of his penitents passed and as she was young and pretty arami	38.925969524381905
a most affectionate greeting as one can well believe took place between him and 	209.64909198691805
where are we going inquired aramis are we going to fight perchance i carry no sw	45.47036108610235
no said lord de winter we are going to pay a visit to her majesty the queen of e	25.922262554680852
oh very well replied aramis then bending his face down to athoss ear what is the	70.33910102405676
nay i know not some evidence required from us perhaps	366.3014718485465
may it not be about that cursed affair asked aramis in which case i do not great	63.27739596007758
if it were so answered athos we should not be taken there by lord de winter for 	36.81672637158186
you re right yes let us go	53.8321096571623
on arriving at the louvre lord de winter entered first indeed there was but one 	87.1902437939664
it was impossible in daylight for the impoverished state of the habitation grudg	55.45337109512697
large rooms completely stripped of furniture bare walls upon which here and ther	237.47101325153628
mazarin is better lodged said aramis	68.44061627268827
mazarin is almost king answered athos madame henrietta is almost no longer queen	121.62075187601036
if you would condescend to be clever athos observed aramis i really do think you	83.57815680171146
athos smiled	122.30350240308135
the queen appeared to be impatiently expecting them for at the first slight nois	84.42197475309736
you are welcome gentlemen she said	57.53203585839252
the gentlemen entered and remained standing but at a motion from the queen they 	107.74318109766494
athos was calm and grave but aramis was furious the sight of such royal misery e	126.25498669870248
you are examining the luxury i enjoy said the queen glancing sadly around her	92.04142352163123
madame replied aramis i must ask your pardon but i know not how to hide my indig	27.03241999412735
is treated at the court of france	36.739221166942876
monsieur aramis is not an officer asked the queen of lord de winter	25.739845486121613
that gentleman is the abb dherblay replied he	34.11922380389612
aramis blushed	580.6970557960406
madame he said i am an abb it is true but i am so against my will	40.71627321236395
i never had a vocation for the bands my cassock is fastened by one button only a	124.48187201893695
this morning being ignorant that i should have the honor of seeing your majesty 	46.456913667861954
the abb dherblay resumed de winter is one of those gallant musketeers formerly b	93.01103868155627
of whom i have spoken to you madame	24.482719185068706
then turning to athos he continued and this gentleman is that noble comte de la 	33.45597190113343
gentlemen said the queen a few years ago i had around me ushers treasures armies	107.97184087733079
today look around you and it may astonish you that in order to accomplish a plan	89.77348438461702
it is enough said athos bowing low if the lives of three men can purchase yours 	84.12545114094739
i thank you gentlemen	51.92505583213434
but hear me continued she	258.299700505741
i am not only the most miserable of queens but the most unhappy of mothers the m	108.3692106403623
my children two of them at least the duke of york and the princess elizabeth are	43.48643352967073
hold gentlemen here is the letter conveyed to me by lord de winter	63.97794032506779
read it	16.90613433807757
obeying the queen athos read aloud the letter which we have already seen in whic	35.88857729148403
well asked athos when he had closed the letter	25.988352789476195
well said the queen it has been refused	23.1441100370025
the two friends exchanged a smile of contempt	39.19984528839797
and now said athos what is to be done i have the honor to inquire from your maje	17.867998885127935
we are ready	24.64252220107751
ah sir you have a noble heart exclaimed the queen with a burst of gratitude whil	25.326978574505432
but you sir said the queen to aramis	15.919548919944148
i madame replied he follow monsieur de la fere wherever he leads even were it on	260.072834200822
well then gentlemen said the queen since it is thus and since you are willing to	34.17216450743433
the king is alone with a few gentlemen whom he fears to lose every day surrounde	90.43958548247092
since lord de winter left him i am distracted sirs	145.73620494409641
i ask much too much perhaps for i have no title to request it	80.96436449090962
go to england join the king be his friends protectors march to battle at his sid	74.89040168755761
and in exchange for the sacrifice that you make gentlemen i promisenot to reward	216.04801594378702
i swear it before heaven	192.8740291735285
and the queen raised her eyes solemnly upward	67.13974154966469
madame said athos when must we set out	31.8883486169213
you consent then exclaimed the queen joyfully	136.2823884034829
yes madame only it seems to me that your majesty goes too far in engaging to loa	50.35741223473836
we render service to god madame in serving a prince so unfortunate a queen so vi	259.44262395508883
madame we are yours body and soul	552.4326533232708
oh sirs said the queen moved even to tears this is the first time for five years	67.39152807574422
god who can read my heart all the gratitude i feel will reward you save my husba	116.31941992177899
in the meantime i remain here	51.478193698866114
have you anything to ask of me from this moment i become your friend and since y	44.46649163264381
madame replied athos i have only to ask your majestys prayers	27.271459906065076
and i said aramis i am alone in the world and have only your majesty to serve	25.650030084256226
the queen held out her hand which they kissed and she said in a low tone to de w	47.08961320077757
if you need money my lord separate the jewels i have given you detach the diamon	104.77157588884444
you will receive for them fifty or sixty thousand francs spend them if necessary	102.01498213013575
the queen had two letters ready one written by herself the other by her daughter	253.36062800168324
both were addressed to king charles	156.63255151518482
she gave the first to athos and the other to aramis so that should they be separ	47.86552740541802
at the foot of the staircase de winter stopped	24.424108733168964
not to arouse suspicions gentlemen said he go your way and i will go mine and th	74.08580450392397
we will travel on horseback as far as our horses can go and afterward we can tak	48.521691080591125
once more let me thank you my good friends both in my own name and the queens	46.55992552427775
the three gentlemen then shook hands lord de winter taking the rue saint honore 	103.46975683778662
well said aramis when they were alone what do you think of this business my dear	26.37963487293493
bad replied athos very bad	89.52195905475682
but you received it with enthusiasm	205.71610309018666
as i shall ever receive the defense of a great principle my dear dherblay	57.36146136461119
monarchs are only strong by the assistance of the aristocracy but aristocracy ca	91.73152113843098
let us then support monarchy in order to support ourselves	134.05793235176284
we shall be murdered there said aramis	21.10612764206683
i hate the englishthey are coarse like every nation that swills beer	428.08708679853515
would it be better to remain here said athos and take a turn in the bastile or t	23.615057689905555
we avoid imprisonment and we play the part of heroes the choice is easy	284.7700179728561
it is true but in everything friend one must always return to the same questiona	103.6425353827773
something like a hundred pistoles that my farmer sent to me the day before i lef	42.905563097277074
i have then about fifty pistoles	168.62622737066158
and you	14.737286983176622
as for me i am quite sure that after turning out all my pockets and emptying my 	46.606394241086754
fortunately lord de winter is rich	48.01199622473957
lord de winter is ruined for the moment oliver cromwell has annexed his income r	43.710490436310224
now is the time when baron porthos would be useful	66.4983999827708
now it is that i regret dartagnan	22.464163596504363
let us entice them away	31.940508250131995
this secret aramis does not belong to us take my advice then and let no one into	124.77990650179323
and moreover in taking such a step we should appear to be doubtful of ourselves	135.45615573792864
let us regret their absence to ourselves for our own sakes but not speak of it	82.75169028556397
you are right but what are you going to do until this evening i have two things 	18.729895646485463
and what are they	24.49880577493118
first a thrust with the coadjutor whom i met last night at madame de rambouillet	90.56451843860337
oh fiea quarrel between priests a duel between allies	2989.6698535283917
what can i do friend he is a bully and so am i his cassock is a burden to him an	92.2488118138477
this kind of life fatigues and oppresses me besides he is a turbulent fellow who	93.24697491721325
i am convinced that if i gave him a box on the ear such as i gave this morning t	61.08480854837798
and i my dear aramis quietly replied athos i think it would only change monsieur	55.19713158284659
take my advice leave things just as they are besides you are neither of you now 	139.50292322088262
so if the second matter which you regret being unable to attend to is not more i	152.51241436137522
oh that is of the first importance	49.31026745731303
attend to it then at once	61.37189182340778
unfortunately it is a thing that i ca nt perform at any time i choose	31.335405990916016
it was arranged for the evening and no other time will serve	61.08177936281104
i understand said athos smiling midnight	114.83550459359884
about that time	45.013072759061856
but my dear fellow those are things that bear postponement and you must put it o	65.4033177044816
yes if i return	50.297848996304864
if you do not return how does it concern you be reasonable	56.47991013763774
come you are no longer twenty years old	58.1665047611536
to my great regret mordieu ah if i were but twenty years old	112.70248522327081
yes said athos doubtless you would commit great follies but now we must part	156.34399828319445
i have one or two visits to make and a letter yet to write	99.93903751223328
call for me at eight oclock or shall i wait supper for you at seven	52.97445258194407
that will do very well said aramis	29.707304140917483
i have twenty visits to make and as many letters to write	121.82128384583906
they then separated	362.56377776864304
athos went to pay a visit to madame de vendome left his name at madame de chevre	19.452231395286812
dear friendi am about to set off with aramis on important business	124.04943325544461
i wished to make my adieux to you but time does not permit	75.97119184186259
remember that i write to you now to repeat how much affection for you i still ch	55.67436490580101
raoul is gone to blois and is ignorant of my departure watch over him in my abse	93.73570593480353
embrace porthos from aramis and myself	99.77229020275435
adieu perhaps farewell	1975.3746870993318
at the hour agreed upon aramis arrived he was dressed as an officer and had the 	54.4564985478584
bythebye he said i think that we are decidedly wrong to depart thus without leav	67.25637633490804
the thing is done dear friend said athos i foresaw that and have embraced them b	107.50952012227833
you are a wonderful man my dear count said aramis you think of everything	18.783447078855133
well have you made up your mind to this journey	60.32503435073127
quite and now that i reflect about it i am glad to leave paris at this moment	37.41457367299684
and so am i replied athos my only regret is not having seen dartagnan but the ra	63.75316350770003
when supper was over blaisois entered	236.6363562501078
sir said he here is monsieur dartagnans answer	43.75492898743913
but i did not tell you there would be an answer stupid said athos	38.69920966087406
and i set off without waiting for one but he called me back and gave me this and	67.29005862254243
athos opened it and began by drawing forth a little note written in these terms	237.81527048169227
my dear countwhen one travels and especially for three months one never has a su	99.20117400394534
now recalling former times of mutual distress i send you half my purse it is mon	423.6306556479824
do nt make a bad use of it i entreat you	30.96882378999274
as to what you say about not seeing you again i believe not a word of it with su	72.57193837597255
au revoir not farewell	289.49389609605424
it is unnecessary to say that from the day i saw raoul i loved him nevertheless 	45.339147267942025
be it well understood that the fifty louis which i send are equally for aramis a	126.95479298187693
athos smiled and his fine eye was dimmed by a tear	40.31016921751632
dartagnan who had loved him so tenderly loved him still although a mazarinist	72.08959754358112
there are the fifty louis ifaith said aramis emptying the purse on the table all	46.64393400232802
well what shall you do with this money count shall you keep it or send it back	78.07130872269053
i shall keep it aramis and even though i had no need of it i still should keep i	68.13989439421725
what is offered from a generous heart should be accepted generously	504.375465021013
take twentyfive of them aramis and give me the remaining twentyfive	124.73766886789251
all right i am glad to see you are of my opinion	26.402909606880826
there now shall we start	194.93561320324255
when you like but have you no groom	157.3088903021602
no that idiot bazin had the folly to make himself verger as you know and therefo	97.08642660779812
very well take blaisois with whom i know not what to do since i already have gri	55.56287055982714
willingly said aramis	6.416549549460243
at this moment grimaud appeared at the door	7.334761376442094
ready said he with his usual curtness	27.072879923011268
let us go then said athos	4.328199638151781
the two friends mounted as did their servants	98.90554711398086
at the corner of the quai they encountered bazin who was running breathlessly	30.31486723162544
oh sir exclaimed he thank heaven i have arrived in time	60.03606294547043

thus illumined aramis read the following epistle	377.1438668152694

i say my dear dherblay that it is almost sacrilege to distrust providence when o	50.81476151933168

by my faith twould be excusable in him to tremble replied aramis for even i feel	76.47873801764908
it was soon time for grimaud to recall the past	72.37678681885919
arriving before the inn at which his master and himself had made such an enormou	105.15496142505091
athos began to laugh for this juvenile escapade of his appeared to be as amusing	88.52237866789963
at last after traveling two days and a night they arrived at boulogne toward the	76.52448244455347
boulogne was a strong position then almost a deserted town built entirely on the	155.61518071694127
gentlemen said de winter on reaching the gate of the town let us do here as at p	35.50842027900626
i know an inn little frequented but of which the host is entirely devoted to me	170.93869266437935
i will go there where i expect to find letters and you go to the first tavern in	65.96643432783881
the matter being thus decided the two friends found about two hundred paces furt	67.12136761296905
their horses were fed but not unsaddled the grooms supped for it was already lat	56.3981239138796
it is needless to say that this caution concerned blaisois alonelong enough sinc	83.81917695666668
athos and aramis walked down toward the port	38.90719924719499
from their dress covered with dust and from a certain easy manner by means of wh	117.88449575700868
there was more especially one upon whom their arrival had produced a decided imp	296.85080582306375

from the moment he perceived them he did not cease to look at them and seemed to	47.94264349311769
on reaching the jetty athos and aramis stopped to look at a little boat made fas	40.30491251108266
that is doubtless our boat said athos	54.581243291191974
yes replied aramis and the sloop out there making ready to sail must be that whi	124.8681757570885
it is not at all amusing here there is not a single woman passing	70.26076100779537

in truth the walker who during the observations of the two friends had passed an	65.95231243370104
gentlemen said the man who was young and pale bowing with ease and courtesy pard	47.844533873484124
we come from paris yes replied athos with the same courtesy what is there we can	36.399035059552205
sir said the young man will you be so good as to tell me if it be true that card	20.69931450515831
that is a strange question said aramis	14.814567690318668
he is and he is not replied athos that is to say he is dismissed by onehalf of f	28.18848832350566
however sir said the stranger he has neither fled nor is in prison	97.53698764876376
no sir not at this moment at least	26.155345413647563
sirs accept my thanks for your politeness said the young man retreating	49.961072588717926
what do you think of that interrogator asked aramis	12.04791482702485
i think he is either a dull provincial person or a spy in search of information	106.8098415597341
and you replied to him with that notion	69.5471120770123
nothing warranted me to answer him otherwise he was polite to me and i was so to	66.77496785397959
but if he be a spy	52.21463380975788
what do you think a spy would be about here we are not living in the time of car	33.31301184334456
it matters not you were wrong to reply to him as you did continued aramis follow	80.80569172950186
and you said athos you forget that you committed a very different kind of imprud	46.83177421281303
did you not see that at that name the young man stopped	24.418979066817457
more reason then when he spoke to you for sending him about his business	134.1252610186134
a quarrel asked athos	165.67211495364467
and since when have you become afraid of a quarrel	113.37570974602498
i am always afraid of a quarrel when i am expected at any place and when such a 	66.13916064190265
besides let me own something to you	146.70081109654825
i am anxious to see that young man nearer	44.02354975187739
and wherefore	613.3406657973123
aramis you will certainly laugh at me you will say that i am always repeating th	57.36835450196213
in beauty or on the contrary asked aramis laughing	56.08291103853918
in ugliness in so far as a man can resemble a woman	124.90605007578647
ah egad cried aramis you set me thinking	59.441033013669596
no in truth you are no visionary my dear friend and now i think of ityouyes ifai	40.05940218496798

from habit that is all	515.3043269657474
i swear to you i like no better than yourself to meet that viper in my path	121.3837904485402
ah here is de winter coming said athos	73.5157490957617
good one thing now is only awanting and that is that our grooms should not keep 	60.03486060563312
no said athos	4.706814487884069
i see them about twenty paces behind my lord	128.71549500079337
i recognize grimaud by his long legs and his determined slouch	213.12876528168883
tony carries our muskets	2994.3123100727275
then we set sail tonight asked aramis glancing toward the west where the sun had	61.58950635629522
probably said athos	6.23808780935707
diable resumed aramis i have little fancy for the sea by day still less at night	175.7733976288394
athos smiled sadly for it was evident that he was thinking of other things as he	29.840531479014096
what ails our friend said aramis he resembles one of dantes damned whose neck ap	75.49897583275776
what the devil makes him glower thus behind him	169.8872826318251
when de winter perceived them in his turn he advanced toward them with surprisin	93.7181417902064
what is the matter my lord said athos and what puts you out of breath thus	31.30263317225516
nothing replied de winter nothing and yet in passing the heights it seemed to me	74.80731370784663
athos glanced at aramis	21.04129329877232
but let us go continued de winter let us be off the boat must be waiting for us 	36.872639429303824
he has seen him said athos in a low tone to aramis	9.231294316217847
they had reached the ladder which led to the boat	32.87558809320486
de winter made the grooms who carried the arms and the porters with the luggage 	70.4339497954897
at this moment athos perceived a man walking on the seashore parallel to the jet	27.51383367660983
he fancied in the darkness that he recognized the young man who had questioned h	24.71983795115992
athos now descended the ladder in his turn without losing sight of the young man	40.51302145275408
the latter to make a short cut had appeared on a sluice	159.00086541714842
he certainly bodes us no good said athos but let us embark once out at sea let h	156.41446450174482
and athos sprang into the boat which was immediately pushed off and which soon s	87.47633615425991
but the young man had begun to follow or rather to advance before the boat	49.41653108529613
she was obliged to pass between the point of the jetty surmounted by a beacon ju	44.75116241763329
they saw him in the distance climbing the rock in order to look down upon the bo	30.41876856507844
ay but said aramis that young fellow is decidedly a spy	116.80753856019902
which is the young man asked de winter turning around	41.161625758490615
he who followed us and spoke to us awaits us there behold	293.2020465162141
de winter turned and followed the direction of aramiss finger	77.83222954005343
the beacon bathed with light the little strait through which they were about to 	150.06590180804062
it is he exclaimed de winter seizing the arm of athos it is he i thought i recog	28.816986246506538
whom do you mean asked aramis	5.9563474255357605
miladys son replied athos	80.60811471352838
the monk exclaimed grimaud	81.07895332389016
the young man heard these words and bent so forward over the rock that one might	65.0205025722368
yes it is i my unclei the son of miladyi the monki the secretary and friend of c	58.59101962723707
in that boat sat three men unquestionably brave whose courage no man would have 	445.50218703437986
as for grimaud his hair stood on end and drops of sweat ran down his brow	66.52453325674885
ah exclaimed aramis that is the nephew the monk and the son of milady as he says	27.74938882676227
alas yes murmured de winter	62.10385234431542
then wait said aramis and with the terrible coolness which on important occasion	67.75072050422054
fire cried grimaud unconsciously	76.22861342814691
athos threw himself on the muzzle of the gun and arrested the shot which was abo	46.37200374184805
the devil take you said aramis	39.37441370970954
i had him so well at the point of my gun i should have sent a ball into his brea	41.613625452045554
it is enough to have killed the mother said athos hoarsely	58.415829068633435
the mother was a wretch who struck at us all and at those dear to us	233.49402110905243
yes but the son has done us no harm	55.21490047155692
grimaud who had risen to watch the effect of the shot fell back hopeless wringin	70.2801954012484
the young man burst into a laugh	43.972809707339444
ah it is certainly you he cried	59.83041301768252
i know you even better now	143.3885462243445
his mocking laugh and threatening words passed over their heads carried by the b	153.75124705931725
aramis shuddered	244.64036593164127
be calm exclaimed athos for heavens sake have we ceased to be men	94.75203604819326
no said aramis but that fellow is a fiend and ask the uncle whether i was wrong 	95.87662330424875
de winter only replied by a groan	110.80894929850238
it was all up with him continued aramis ah i much fear that with all your wisdom	123.03249427581412
athos took lord de winters hand and tried to turn the conversation	76.60556903545127
when shall we land in england he asked but de winter seemed not to hear his word	72.09588844283849
hold athos said aramis perhaps there is yet time	79.74729780903412
see if he is still in the same place	19.882146123033124
athos turned around with an effort the sight of the young man was evidently pain	37.12356161649778
decidedly aramis said athos i think i was wrong not to let you fire	31.907140608312023
hold your tongue replied aramis you would make me weep if such a thing were poss	41.13164602556633
at this moment they were hailed by a voice from the sloop and a few seconds late	47.9920368904447
the captain was only waiting for his passengers hardly had they put foot on deck	145.36544874874576
at this instant the three friends turned in spite of themselves a last look on t	37.876685189878984
then a voice reached them once more sending this threat to our next meeting sirs	462.1552965294925

friquet had put on his sunday clothes under the pretext of having a swollen face	105.86156639594097
on leaving bazin friquet started off to the palais royal where he arrived at the	30.609259370448736
this amusement lasted from the barriere des sergens to the place of notre dame a	61.53578605590287
in consequence he took to his heels arrived breathlessly at the councillors door	145.19648615582136

broussel then proceeded to his wifes room and asked for breakfast it was nine oc	56.56580677996036
the councillor placed himself at the window the street was completely deserted b	101.9390276574603
this noise redoubled when dartagnan with a company of musketeers placed himself 	171.73862216285252
he had instructed porthos to profit by this opportunity to see the ceremony and 	58.92797172158322
the sergeant of this company a veteran of the spanish wars had recognized portho	55.09830942870437
porthos had not only been well received by the company but he was moreover looke	64.57671082511878
at ten oclock the guns of the louvre announced the departure of the king and the	17.046203092701276
at last the king appeared with the queen in a gilded chariot	87.67322933449023
ten other carriages followed containing the ladies of honor the officers of the 	171.41153239958302

just as the court was settling down in the cathedral a carriage bearing the arms	80.39610676149239
when it arrived there four guards and a police officer who accompanied it mounte	150.74299435842505
all the world was occupied with the ceremony so that neither the chariot nor the	75.10507908248448
friquet whose eye ever on the alert could alone have discovered them had gone to	190.58671509798137
thence he saw the king the queen and monsieur mazarin and heard the mass as well	55.79406381412465
toward the end of the service the queen seeing comminges standing near her waiti	44.417263693393245
go comminges and may god aid you	153.15964200047839
comminges immediately left the church and entered the rue saint christophe	38.65739881112901
friquet seeing this fine officer thus walk away followed by two guards amused hi	365.6439206798414
hardly had the police officer observed comminges at the end of the rue cocatrix 	26.664721718134267
comminges knocked at the door at the same moment and friquet was waiting behind 	27.117887031051193

good said comminges	4.043235568411423
at this moment the door was opened and having questioned the servant the officer	24.721936186240445
broussel was seated at the table with his family having his wife opposite to him	43.6315051984415
the worthy man restored to perfect health was tasting the fine fruit which madam	407.5393767131238
at sight of the officer broussel was somewhat moved but seeing him bow politely 	142.1355795048395
still in spite of this reciprocal politeness the countenances of the women betra	30.528979386825334
sir said comminges i am the bearer of an order from the king	19.938359754348063

a thunderbolt falling in the midst of these good people so peacefully assembled 	143.44667504255588
it was a horrible thing at that period to be imprisoned by the enmity of the kin	18.71684737609006
louvieres sprang forward to snatch his sword which stood against a chair in a co	41.37862702268879
madame broussel separated by the width of the table from her husband burst into 	85.89633931834855

when a carriage is chosen it ought to be strong	87.23985753328326
the carriage in which a broussel is to be arrested ought to be able to bear ten 	63.60753228240142

yes my head is not only swimming but burning	184.03475158511012

bring hither that horse	564.8228198475485
friquet heard perfectly but he pretended not to do so and tried to continue his 	52.543858759518606
dartagnan felt inclined for an instant to pursue master friquet but not wishing 	105.57719851185149
friquet had a quick eye and a fine ear	135.96252072226025
he saw dartagnans movement heard the sound of the click and stopped at once	62.22968864547316
ah it is you your honor he said advancing toward dartagnan and i am truly please	90.84392059675
dartagnan looked attentively at friquet and recognized the little chorister of t	34.025989964572425

raoul mounted his horse and both leisurely took their way to the rue tiquetonne	42.50199677702598
dartagnan watched over the youth as if he had been his own son	54.89017535884627
they arrived without accident at the hotel de la chevrette	23.37800506136249
the handsome madeleine announced to dartagnan that planchet had returned bringin	73.25791674561884
dartagnan desired planchet to be summoned but he had disappeared	60.51117300883158

the comte de la fere himself	14.549994397949897

i do not understand you sir said raoul	7.64254927418298
dartagnan rose and taking a letter from his writingdesk presented it to raoul	38.550008473276336
the face of the latter became serious when he had cast his eyes upon the paper	68.62567819330754

to present our respects to the cardinal	58.63766733522716
porthos swallowed the second glass with the same grace with which he had imbibed	68.46976555922748

dartagnan and porthos obeyed	36.25226221477419
the court of anne of austria was full of gayety and animation for after having g	63.32246030863841
broussel had been conducted out of paris without further resistance and was at t	56.94007164237907

dartagnan had been a hundred times in the same room with the queen since he had 	38.29505034087271

these names are too numerous for me to remember them all and i will content myse	46.355632774429644
porthos bowed	49.37251026418695
at this moment the coadjutor was announced a cry of surprise ran through the roy	14.934569225143898
although the coadjutor had preached that same morning it was well known that he 	76.21320316460493
the fact was in leaving notre dame the coadjutor had learned the event of the da	49.695282799456976

monsieur de retz wished to become archbishop in his uncles place and cardinal li	37.10443080050874
he therefore hastened to the palace to congratulate the queen on the battle of l	36.84790072262711
the coadjutor possessed perhaps as much wit as all those put together who were a	332.3320769433661
his speech therefore was so well turned that in spite of the great wish felt by 	109.13284678525885
he concluded by saying that he placed his feeble influence at her majestys comma	149.65779572446218
during the whole time he was speaking the queen appeared to be well pleased with	43.12197986265162
immediately the wits of the court plunged into satire	139.37499709033887
nogentbeautin the fool of the court exclaimed that the queen was very happy to h	45.64500772842782
this caused a universal burst of laughter	166.79674736629903
the count de villeroy said that he did not know how any fear could be entertaine	23.09028958093406
the marechal de la meilleraie added that in case the coadjutor should appear on 	53.206773261285235

yes madame replied the coadjutor i have to beg you to reflect twice ere you caus	41.6840579156105
the queen turned her back and the laughing recommenced	81.67100097919048
the coadjutor bowed and left the palace casting upon the cardinal such a glance 	87.48054916443128
that glance was so sharp that it penetrated the heart of mazarin who reading in 	96.3075163967252
if occasion requires monsieur you will remember that man who has just gone out w	99.80869182017514
yes my lord he replied	14.789066938475493
then turning toward porthos the devil said he this has a bad look	57.29948771028364
i dislike these quarrels among men of the church	217.57270562926675
gondy withdrew distributing benedictions on his way and finding a malicious sati	97.48519009167342

but whilst they were indulging in extravagant joy at the palais royal to increas	94.54591760454461
on his return home the coadjutor was informed that a young man had come in after	50.80708107365091
he hastened to his cabinet	46.28206249957981
broussels son was there still furious and still bearing bloody marks of his stru	119.1186878285339
the only precaution he had taken in coming to the archbishopric was to leave his	86.50500011821472
the coadjutor went to him and held out his hand	24.33970841856998
the young man gazed at him as if he would have read the secret of his heart	16.238531312574306

a plain and simple beggar as i have said my lord who asks for alms as he gives h	152.32976944192467
and you say that he has a great influence over his compeers	28.856580660697432
are you aware my lord that mendacity is an organized body a kind of association 	61.62011558810694
yes i have heard it said replied the coadjutor	26.943033731509576
well the man whom i offer you is a general syndic	109.59357760051147
and what do you know of him	11.420707357517509
nothing my lord except that he is tormented with remorse	74.29796290893987
what makes you think so	122.71423039649136
on the twentyeighth of every month he makes me say a mass for the repose of the 	75.24100442154361
and his name	71.97340066866073

gondy dressed himself as an officer put on a felt cap with a red feather hung on	110.75517344617381
the coadjutor and his companion passed through all the streets lying between the	98.51234079066867
eustache church watching carefully to ascertain the popular feeling	639.8169484924059
the people were in an excited mood but like a swarm of frightened bees seemed no	88.64842522762153
on arriving at the rue des prouvaires the curate pointed toward the square befor	29.20251113999703
stop he said there he is at his post	24.97281869131819
gondy looked at the spot indicated and perceived a beggar seated in a chair and 	52.86828949348299
is it by permission that he remains there asked gondy	165.1048512585352
no my lord these places are bought	121.03492723552029
i believe this man paid his predecessor a hundred pistoles for his	87.1324729296287

his countenance denoted the struggle between two opposite principlesa wicked nat	289.3442978341614
he started on seeing the cavalier with the curate	211.41916678485308
the latter and the coadjutor touched the brush with the tips of their fingers an	82.24191670943625
maillard began the curate this gentleman and i have come to talk with you a litt	45.87878621322748
with me said the mendicant it is a great honor for a poor distributor of holy wa	27.543033751308776
there was an ironical tone in his voice which he could not quite disguise and wh	54.33806274286674
yes continued the curate apparently accustomed to this tone yes we wish to know 	198.3548620522441
the mendicant shook his head	34.66675420308558
these are melancholy doings your reverence which always fall again upon the poor	161.96772687114031
as to what is said everybody is discontented everybody complains but everybody m	520.0157206414782

i know monsieur le cur said the beggar that you have always been very kind to me	36.698101702370266
and do you think your power as great with the fraternity as monsieur le cur told	91.5486912447821
i think they have some esteem for me said the mendicant with pride and that not 	69.72781756278256
and could you count on fifty resolute men good unemployed but active souls brawl	447.1291934092768
i think said the beggar i can undertake things more difficult and more important	121.40323978792641
ah ah said gondy you will undertake then some night to throw up some ten barrica	40.92995075082066
i will undertake to throw up fifty and when the day comes to defend them	77.68269543400683
ifaith exclaimed gondy you speak with a certainty that gives me pleasure and sin	123.75314349433336

then said the coadjutor this evening at ten oclock and if i am pleased with you 	30.284013745768153
the eyes of the mendicant dashed with cupidity but he quickly suppressed his emo	73.09426826862621

the curate then entered followed by planchet	110.33826852939526
your holiness said the curate here is the person of whom i had the honor to spea	25.03890589486301
planchet saluted in the manner of one accustomed to fine houses	144.89479659798835
and you are disposed to serve the cause of the people asked gondy	28.875823399871283
most undoubtedly said planchet	24.03568117877247

you see in me such as i am a person sentenced to be hung	61.930737087277166

and your business is	67.85599073811662
that of a confectioner in the rue des lombards	30.03347272496279

by what sign tomorrow shall we be able to distinguish friends from foes	249.96533552946434

gondy went to a box and drew forth a bag	42.801502205271554
here are five hundred pistoles he said and if the action goes off well you may r	57.50943516685817
i will give a faithful account of the sum to your lordship said planchet putting	41.15925091249127
that is right i recommend the cardinal to your attention	92.44115015227669

yes he appears to be a resolute fellow	56.69520764001954
well he will do more than he has promised	38.27755164794806
he will do wonders then	107.61840983468234
the curate rejoined planchet who was waiting for him on the stairs	39.746406555029075
ten minutes later the curate of st	11.411423291156282
sulpice was announced	61.37136506649555
as soon as the door of gondys study was opened a man rushed in	31.4134473595746
it was the count de rochefort	9.39925684096201
tis you then my dear count cried gondy offering his hand	30.527887604965006
you have made up your mind at last my lord said rochefort	24.97799919461563
it has been made up a long time said gondy	17.652430004879058
let us say no more on the subject you tell me so i believe you	26.6336777177239

good my dear rochefort but that is not all	15.302582755547181
what have you done with monsieur de beaufort	14.996324784397185
he is in vendome where he will wait until i write to him to return to paris	34.31886882415199

and you will leave the command to him	33.75378502146402
of the war yes but in politics	140.81155462079948
you must know it is not his element	48.81864485518668
he must leave me to negotiate for my cardinals hat in my own fashion	88.55336678793999
you care about it then so much	126.73988796169027
since they force me to wear a hat of a form which does not become me said gondy 	84.65586075084003
one must not dispute matters of taste and colors said rochefort laughing	94.40504809192376
i answer for his consent	308.7987769482329
how soon can he be here	100.60646752428583

the riot	1407.7262088150408
it was about eleven oclock at night	31.295641001127777
gondy had not walked a hundred steps ere he perceived the strange change which h	73.72782189670792
the whole city seemed peopled with fantastic beings silent shadows were seen unp	130.47392283885003
these active beings flitted here and there like so many demons completing some u	125.16247983628189
gondy gazed on these deeds of darkness on these nocturnal laborers with a kind o	75.038711320568
he felt almost inclined to cross himself when one of these beings happened to ap	61.17254529132371
he reached the rue saint honore and went up it toward the rue de la ferronnerie 	22.133581195404144
these men were shopkeepers who had arms to lend to those who had none	79.77388274521785
one individual went from door to door bending under the weight of swords guns mu	219.00662535395904
by the light of a lantern the coadjutor recognized planchet	36.10914591265937
the coadjutor proceeded onward to the quay by way of the rue de la monnaie there	48.55099129634971
they were standing motionless while single men passed from one group to another	276.2528122727183
all these cloaks gray or black were raised behind by the point of a sword or bef	69.78632676132396
on reaching the pont neuf the coadjutor found it strictly guarded and a man appr	44.65762470201984
who are you asked the man	20.465102196813692
i do not know you for one of us	17.510982485680678
then it is because you do not know your friends my dear monsieur louvieres said 	18.372720367763378
louvieres recognized him and bowed	99.82892067936655
gondy continued his way and went as far as the tour de nesle	27.019410607602477
there he saw a lengthy chain of people gliding under the walls	54.73774253444432
they might be said to be a procession of ghosts for they were all wrapped in whi	66.52894267322117
when they reached a certain spot these men appeared to be annihilated one after 	99.51775543513311
gondy edged into a corner saw them vanish from the first until the last but one	175.95193098271704
the last raised his eyes to ascertain doubtless that neither his companions nor 	173.9204387649021
he walked straight up to him and placed a pistol to his throat	48.53096988273034
halloo monsieur de rochefort said gondy laughing are you a boy to play with fire	66.84215384858595
rochefort recognized the voice	139.19719937499045
ah it is you my lord said he	17.22744881300408
the very same	511.7403090327125
what people are you leading thus into the bowels of the earth	79.03190164163188
my fifty recruits from the chevalier dhumieres who are destined to enter the lig	60.80385192662855
and where are you going	9.909078025034994
to the house of one of my friends a sculptor only we enter by the trap through w	61.97791585858033
very good said gondy shaking rochefort by the hand who descended in his turn and	28.531796842681256
it was now one oclock in the morning and the coadjutor returned home	22.775729354844234
he opened a window and leaned out to listen	63.28312909237879
a strange incomprehensible unearthly sound seemed to pervade the whole city one 	103.17085439438395
from time to time a dull sound was heard like that of a rising tempest or a bill	62.26990913238118
the work of revolt continued the whole night thus	274.798560628997
the next morning on awaking paris seemed to be startled at her own appearance	36.70713230686572
it was like a besieged town	69.73529894734236
armed men shouldering muskets watched over the barricades with menacing looks wo	147.30293451054567
those bearing plumed hats and gold swords were stopped and made to cry long live	223.6776249826206
they had not yet begun to slay but it was well felt that the inclination to do s	63.502614939798775
the barricades had been pushed as far as the palais royal	44.14293576883392
from the rue de bons enfants to that of the ferronnerie from the rue saint thoma	17.35458613457377
among these thousands moved in bands numbering from one hundred to two hundred p	106.95641931612136
the astonishment of mazarin and of anne of austria was great when it was announc	30.576116050517754
then a window was opened and when they saw and heard they were convinced	57.77916405632033
mazarin shrugged his shoulders and pretended to despise the populace but he turn	73.08301127313932
as for the queen furious and left to her own guidance she went for the marechal 	56.24979082369201
the marshal was ordinarily very adventurous and was wo nt to hesitate at nothing	128.81834142133783
he took a hundred and fifty men and attempted to go out by the pont du louvre bu	33.84462684387743
the marshal made no attempt to force that barrier and returned up the quay	120.83897402452986
but at pont neuf he found louvieres and his bourgeois	32.913585876918425
this time the marshal charged but he was welcomed by musket shots while stones f	225.8796782737208
he left there three men	224.31089385369182
he beat a retreat toward the market but there he met planchet with his halberdie	65.20371595078109
he attempted to ride over those gray cloaks but the gray cloaks held their groun	189.52178435133308
the marshal then entered the rue saint honore but there he was opposed by the ba	33.00838303072378
they were guarded not only by armed men but even by women and children	141.7800001857586
master friquet the owner of a pistol and of a sword which louvieres had given hi	46.718391388397954
the marshal thought this barrier not so well fortified as the others and determi	124.76830460046948
he dismounted twenty men to make a breach in the barricade whilst he and others 	156.9124339733653
the twenty men marched straight toward the barrier but from behind the beams fro	113.26569343327573
the marechal de la meilleraie was caught between two fires but he was brave and 	57.178576675544456
he returned blow for blow and cries of pain began to be heard in the crowd	116.52226723795842
the guards more skillful did greater execution but the bourgeois more numerous o	398.5046069895733
men fell around him as they had fallen at rocroy or at lerida	43.117137745300255
fontrailles his aidedecamp had an arm broken his horse had received a bullet in 	156.66549248391155
in short he had reached that supreme moment when the bravest feel a shudder in t	140.9653315593413
all fell to their knees	180.92230140577064
the marshal recognized him and hastened to meet him	43.15279298545611
get me out of this in heavens name he said or i shall leave my carcass here and 	55.17900005160515
a great tumult arose in the midst of which even the noise of thunder could not h	37.58817228614661
gondy raised his hand and demanded silence	114.9361936123895
all were still	119.05003615728546
my children he said this is the marechal de la meilleraie as to whose intentions	38.67662028702814
you pledge yourself to that marshal added gondy turning to la meilleraie	116.83438816580372
morbleu cried the latter i should say that i do pledge myself to it i had no hop	56.145068089830275
he gives you his word of honor said gondy	48.07272634005795
the marshal raised his hand in token of assent	23.364604033230954
long live the coadjutor cried the crowd	96.45044288548341
some voices even added long live the marshal but all took up the cry in chorus d	234.28597672098329
the crowd gave place the barricade was opened and the marshal with the remnant o	61.034526051225875
it was almost a triumphal procession only behind the guards the barricades were 	122.06503611388047
the marshal bit his fingers	258.73891715565463
in the meantime as we have said mazarin was in his closet putting his affairs in	37.03200544677058
he called for dartagnan but in the midst of such tumult he little expected to se	76.76466901160325
in about ten minutes dartagnan appeared at the door followed by the inseparable 	17.655927753874067
ah come in come in monsieur dartagnan cried the cardinal and welcome your friend	92.56262449513757
but what is going on in this accursed paris	40.29672609971855
what is going on my lord nothing good replied dartagnan shaking his head	33.124366996222804
the town is in open revolt and just now as i was crossing the rue montorgueil wi	47.89348363026054
speak speak	1542.0338498544795
down with mazarin ifaith the treasonable word is out	154.04316815435354
mazarin smiled but became very pale	110.95117424226775
and you did cry he asked	195.4534878456372
ifaith no said dartagnan i was not in voice monsieur du vallon has a cold and di	49.30389585472524
then my lord	14.742329923536749
then what asked mazarin	34.519221161672775
look at my hat and cloak	39.52452509218112
and dartagnan displayed four gunshot holes in his cloak and two in his beaver	101.68764426427688
as for porthoss coat a blow from a halberd had cut it open on the flank and a pi	49.46691224510524
diavolo said the cardinal pensively gazing at the two friends with lively admira	38.696727782216115
at this moment the tumult was heard nearer	23.489897487502734
mazarin wiped his forehead and looked around him	22.155349198547253
he had a great desire to go to the window but he dared not	21.920282665713643
see what is going on monsieur dartagnan said he	24.012958822372525
dartagnan went to the window with his habitual composure	26.306948029410442
oho said he what is this marechal de la meilleraie returning without a hatfontra	33.58223867561753
they have received orders to fire on the people if the people approach the palai	60.53397194362067
but if they fire all is lost cried dartagnan	107.29503848420974
we have the gates	60.51939695072644
the gates to hold for five minutesthe gates they will be torn down twisted into 	160.05059721935024
in spite of this recommendation which owing to the noise could scarcely have bee	64.00180129384505
the balls might be heard peppering the facade of the palais royal and one of the	27.81858537981684
alack alack cried the cardinal a venetian glass	114.31277497366757
oh my lord said dartagnan quietly shutting the window it is not worth while weep	47.715557683437005
but what do you advise then asked mazarin trembling	28.61560417081934
eh egad to give up broussel as they demand what the devil do you want with a mem	49.39420958089667
and you monsieur du vallon is that your advice what would you do	34.4468153869932

come come with me gentlemen exclaimed mazarin	27.621585631807264
i will go and discuss the matter with the queen	28.03815965680312
he stopped at the end of the corridor and said	19.081809051398288
i can count upon you gentlemen can i not	110.81629399950812
we do not give ourselves twice over said dartagnan we have given ourselves to yo	37.67535425487129
very well then said mazarin enter this cabinet and wait till i come back	49.954188130580846
and turning off he entered the drawingroom by another door	115.05266020225646
chapter xlviii	2.2276086421093675
the riot becomes a revolution	222.1466957861191
the closet into which dartagnan and porthos had been ushered was separated from 	140.29977394553833
the queen was standing in the room pale with anger her selfcontrol however was s	61.09951971034251
comminges villequier and guitant were behind her and the women again were behind	81.39050447692549
the chancellor sequier who twenty years previously had persecuted her so ruthles	98.60652236923643
then the danger was so imminent the rioters came so near uttering such threats t	173.10209238538746
fortunately however he had not been taken the people believing that he had escap	32.89704811361707
then disguised in the clothes of the marquis do he had left the hotel stumbling 	106.94729056340215
during the recital mazarin entered and glided noiselessly up to the queen to lis	48.364637711906745
well said the queen when the chancellor had finished speaking what do you think 	32.04315071000393
i think that matters look very gloomy madame	181.53057954531621
but what step would you propose to me	130.40587758147535
i could propose one to your majesty but i dare not	71.52722755809505
you may you may sir said the queen with a bitter smile you were not so timid onc	29.735514046713483
the chancellor reddened and stammered some words	697.0388475420174
it is not a question of the past but of the present said the queen you said you 	30.19830788420027
madame said the chancellor hesitating it would be to release broussel	57.71728954593278
the queen although already pale became visibly paler and her face was contracted	177.15048497141584
release broussel she cried never	169.14742692023387
at this moment steps were heard in the anteroom and without any announcement the	52.370652460471256
ah there you are marechal cried anne of austria joyfully	49.44647775794878
i trust you have brought this rabble to reason	200.46451432613816
madame replied the marechal i have left three men on the pont neuf four at the h	31.48706588568281

ah indeed said the queen it would have much astonished me if that low cur with h	93.36389856207249
madame said la meilleraie do not say too much against him before me for the serv	37.75420423301431
very good said the queen be as grateful as you like it does not implicate me you	25.423832396555433
yes madame but i only came back on one conditionthat i would transmit to your ma	70.79899317937489
the will exclaimed the queen frowning	178.59430265101992
oh oh monsieur marechal you must indeed have found yourself in wondrous peril to	152.33943040201856
the irony with which these words were uttered did not escape the marechal	120.71043345460416
pardon madame he said i am not a lawyer i am a mere soldier and probably therefo	28.964425300741173
as for what you do me the honor to say i presume you mean i was afraid	44.19601111085742
the queen smiled	42.447504636684
well then madame yes i did feel fear and though i have been through twelve pitch	126.93669378009919
yes and i would rather face your majesty however threatening your smile than fac	229.35691461937475
bravo said dartagnan in a whisper to porthos well answered	29.969489964315642
well said the queen biting her lips whilst her courtiers looked at each other wi	32.359896359492524
that broussel shall be given up to them madame	63.856332879297106
never said the queen never	27.851940142346443
your majesty is mistress said la meilleraie retreating a few steps	25.247709706892643
where are you going marechal asked the queen	15.429829466066781
to give your majestys reply to those who await it	107.26557306837975
stay marechal i will not appear to parley with rebels	128.1538416413519
madame i have pledged my word and unless you order me to be arrested i shall be 	51.219363252641955
anne of austrias eyes shot glances of fire	225.20654000227674
oh that is no impediment sir said she i have had greater men than you arrestedgu	67.60762675418124
mazarin sprang forward	223.69831755349531
madame said he if i dared in my turn advise	67.7124486357151
would it be to give up broussel sir if so you can spare yourself the trouble	90.54297192283724
no said mazarin although perhaps that counsel is as good as any other	63.311530842228066
then what may it be	28.93331132192971
to call for monsieur le coadjuteur	85.86738649256431
the coadjutor cried the queen that dreadful mischief maker it is he who has rais	72.53831011273601
the more reason said mazarin if he has raised it he can put it down	80.62249141262586
and hold madame suggested comminges who was near a window out of which he could 	107.85570177135743
the queen sprang to the window	25.65041536010449
it is true she said the arch hypocritesee	43.852294582429174
i see said mazarin that everybody kneels before him although he be but coadjutor	279.8926368406906
i persist then madame in my wish he laid an emphasis on the word that your majes	119.62579733217524
and wherefore do you not say like the rest your will replied the queen in a low 	41.2656250823314
mazarin bowed	60.79776358891223
monsieur le marechal said the queen after a moments reflection go and find the c	37.982562051689335
and what shall i say to the people	14.472799819596164
that they must have patience said anne as i have	37.307531488704605
the fiery spanish woman spoke in a tone so imperative that the marechal made no 	116.52454530824471
dartagnan turned to porthos	16.490826088431376
how will this end he said	102.75588912711103
we shall soon see said porthos in his tranquil way	40.87143210091429
in the meantime anne of austria approached comminges and conversed with him in a	20.977188251824785
ere long the door opened and the marechal entered followed by the coadjutor	55.57354884563632
there madame he said is monsieur gondy who hastens to obey your majestys summons	51.28860120467043
the queen advanced a few steps to meet him and then stopped cold severe unmoved 	88.48646459883048
gondy bowed respectfully	122.93321203061649
well sir said the queen what is your opinion of this riot	21.56185865911895
that it is no longer a riot madame he replied but a revolt	105.8253793340089
the revolt is at the door of those who think my people can rebel cried anne unab	90.7113351548007
revolt thus it is called by those who have wished for this demonstration and who	77.61227349733724
was it to tell me that madame coldly replied gondy that your majesty admitted me	56.43882728200798
no my dear coadjutor said mazarin it was to ask your advice in the unhappy dilem	37.04479221687018
is it true asked gondy feigning astonishment that her majesty summoned me to ask	56.58968263794507
yes said the queen it is requested	23.541926996231968
the coadjutor bowed	108.48109189957917
your majesty wishes then	39.21869129559126
you to say what you would do in her place mazarin hastened to reply	90.40483344736253
the coadjutor looked at the queen who replied by a sign in the affirmative	33.554299160497074
were i in her majestys place said gondy coldly i should not hesitate i should re	77.93591887829578
and if i do not give him up what think you will be the result exclaimed the quee	38.98956619675096
i believe that not a stone in paris will remain unturned put in the marechal	137.38087098604547
it was not your opinion that i asked said the queen sharply without even turning	70.69532592854672
if it is i whom your majesty interrogates replied the coadjutor in the same calm	43.14702156355991
the color mounted to the queens face her fine blue eyes seemed to start out of h	48.806518240208106
mazarin himself who was well accustomed to the domestic outbreaks of this distur	61.085332845745334
give up broussel she cried fine counsel indeed	832.3366323494533
upon my word one can easily see it comes from a priest	64.64063703908514
gondy remained firm and the abuse of the day seemed to glide over his head as th	65.08939935825379
he looked coldly at the queen who nudged mazarin to make him say something in hi	78.9097448787582
mazarin according to his custom was thinking much and saying little	289.986570648617
ho ho said he good advice advice of a friend	97.1030940280083
i too would give up that good monsieur broussel dead or alive and all would be a	108.99918950550297
if you yield him dead all will indeed be at an end my lord but quite otherwise t	102.25079108307052
did i say dead or alive replied mazarin	75.05785672907226
it was only a way of speaking	41.35256089557537
you know i am not familiar with the french language which you monsieur le coadju	30.957130466097308
this is a council of state dartagnan remarked to porthos but we held better ones	108.70452720990362
at the saint gervais bastion said porthos	35.686725868939575
there and elsewhere	1025.8023851214152
the coadjutor let the storm pass over his head and resumed still with the same t	77.90909199671057
madame if the opinion i have submitted to you does not please you it is doubtles	55.8135418411132
i know too well the wisdom of the queen and that of her advisers to suppose that	54.67391066031407
thus then it is your opinion said anne of austria with a sneer and biting her li	22.52459472212668
yes madame replied the coadjutor gravely	40.43373067536858
but if i am to believe you sir the people seem to have thrown off all restraint	45.01967339396874
it is a bad year for kings said gondy shaking his head look at england madame	32.869819720189156
yes but fortunately we have no oliver cromwell in france replied the queen	40.51405498503719
who knows said gondy such men are like thunderboltsone recognizes them only when	149.18476989319498
every one shuddered and there was a moment of silence during which the queen pre	58.08942220216241
porthos murmured dartagnan look well at that priest	113.31890508065113
yes said porthos i see him	12.529480131044831
what then	76.61068317961013
well he is a man	13.521856997935272
porthos looked at dartagnan in astonishment	14.107271429190833
evidently he did not understand his meaning	20.38555447765262
your majesty continued the coadjutor pitilessly is about to take such measures a	103.20204918137853
in that case you monsieur le coadjuteur who have such power over them and are at	71.06582415399451
perhaps it will be too late said gondy still unmoved perhaps i shall have lost a	40.39593966832796
have i not then that right cried the queen	72.31382992329556
if you have it use it replied gondy	23.210730574479047
peste said dartagnan to porthos	11.86639030625118
there is a man after my own heart	39.51031718773806
oh if he were minister and i were his dartagnan instead of belonging to that bea	129.0279723246176
yes said porthos	4.014380030587583
the queen made a sign for every one except mazarin to quit the room and gondy bo	34.08303565106487
stay sir said anne to him	14.640674184835664
good thought gondy she is going to yield	34.22053651713115
she is going to have him killed said dartagnan to porthos but at all events it s	24.70024926834159
i swear to heaven on the contrary that if they fall upon him i will fall upon th	44.32674885373764
and i too said porthos	15.940065507839114
good muttered mazarin sitting down we shall soon see something startling	150.29505899075022
the queens eyes followed the retreating figures and when the last had closed the	111.22906466831732
it was evident that she was making unnatural efforts to subdue her anger she fan	53.697374333408945
gondy who began to feel uneasy examined the tapestry with his eyes touched the c	71.7519687928072
and now at last said the queen now that we are alone repeat your counsel monsieu	72.95296723352102
it is this madame that you should appear to have reflected and publicly acknowle	77.99633173691824
oh cried anne to humble myself thus am i or am i not the queen this screaming mo	124.97134472740709
and she sprang toward gondy whom assuredly at that moment she hated more than br	93.09640939025428
the coadjutor remained immovable and not a muscle of his face was discomposed on	88.2322761976167
he were a dead man said the gascon if there were still a vitry at the court and 	32.62943223087857
hush said porthos listen	24.39178829901587
madame cried the cardinal seizing hold of anne and drawing her back madame what 	120.02524355145346
then he added in spanish anne are you mad you a queen to quarrel like a washerwo	48.06280176531998
at the first words of this address dartagnan had seized porthoss arm which he pr	46.639975172490416
when mazarin ceased speaking he said to porthos in a low tone	27.247887263278468
never tell mazarin that i understand spanish or i am a lost man and you are also	50.8284656391594
all right said porthos	13.637966806327746
this rough appeal marked by the eloquence which characterized mazarin when he sp	128.99887412433145
the queen on her part thus chided softened immediately and sat down and in an al	100.87239635126436
pardon me sir and attribute this violence to what i suffer	100.07084179403492
a woman and consequently subject to the weaknesses of my sex i am alarmed at the	81.62688960683077
madame replied gondy bowing your majesty is mistaken in qualifying my sincere ad	96.98074771987017
your majesty has none but submissive and respectful subjects	258.219285043524
it is not the queen with whom the people are displeased they ask for broussel an	38.93005323528875
mazarin who at the words it is not the queen with whom the people are displeased	51.169807950662566
madame credit the coadjutor who is one of the most able politicians we have the 	54.75228271648794
ah how much you have need of me cunning rogue thought gondy	120.70203010099296
and what will he promise us said dartagnan	31.008003481216537
peste if he is giving away hats like that porthos let us look out and both deman	84.40112496128269
corbleu let the civil war last but one year and i will have a constables sword g	165.2854735833329
and for me put in porthos	205.91552483035983
for you i will give you the baton of the marechal de la meilleraie who does not 	14.523705893753043
and so sir said the queen you are seriously afraid of a public tumult	54.09759076523639
seriously said gondy astonished at not having further advanced i fear that when 	259.2948303661785
and i said the queen think that in such a case other embankments should be raise	95.5407319885647
go i will reflect	222.07531192109226
gondy looked at mazarin astonished and mazarin approached the queen to speak to 	33.18175223885881
gondy smiled the queens color rose and mazarin grew even paler	300.2364387543091
what is that again he asked	42.27524373178724
at this moment comminges rushed into the room	11.319153233906313
pardon your majesty he cried but the people have dashed the sentinels against th	84.847052887684
listen madame said gondy	7.01370827494368
the moaning of waves the noise of thunder the roaring of a volcano can not be co	64.36069350912383
what are my commands said the queen	33.2374617773458
yes for time presses	565.8223733573079
how many men have you about the palais royal	28.111045211642228
six hundred	13.360799005922305
place a hundred around the king and with the remainder sweep away this mob for m	107.24900232808764
madame cried mazarin what are you about	16.16501841307374
go said the queen	12.251397717960353
comminges went out with a soldiers passive obedience	123.4997778146346
at this moment a monstrous battering was heard	14.368260729609256
one of the gates began to yield	26.00454825909951
oh madame cried mazarin you have ruined us allthe king yourself and me	79.6310975892193
at this cry from the soul of the frightened cardinal anne became alarmed in her 	69.83512747857777
it is too late said mazarin tearing his hair too late	28.257735545264296
the gale had given way	209.88515039077348
hoarse shouts were heard from the excited mob	330.6027902891056
dartagnan put his hand to his sword motioning to porthos to follow his example	34.854600289844655
save the queen cried mazarin to the coadjutor	26.04355047345904
gondy sprang to the window and threw it open he recognized louvieres at the head	31.641949229041373
not a step further he shouted the queen is signing	124.9979251311968
what are you saying asked the queen	7.558951546599114
the truth madame said mazarin placing a pen and a paper before her you must then	101.02171204465698
the queen fell into a chair took the pen and signed	34.07392758983013
the people kept back by louvieres had not made another step forward but the awfu	85.15233214060855
the queen had written the keeper of the prison at saint germain will set council	136.6107601801024
the coadjutor whose eyes devoured her slightest movements seized the paper immed	205.4749355832177
this is the order he said	25.554050867450844
all paris seemed to shout with joy and then the air resounded with the cries of 	44.52355442448425
long live the queen cried de gondy but the cries which replied to his were poor 	124.9806412661885
and now that you have obtained what you want go said she monsieur de gondy	48.406813529794384
whenever her majesty has need of me replied the coadjutor bowing her majesty kno	64.63780137997873
ah cursed priest cried anne when he had retired stretching out her arm to the sc	74.88386694636036
mazarin wished to approach her	98.49543147798116
leave me she exclaimed you are not a man and she went out of the room	27.23510534195374
it is you who are not a woman muttered mazarin	34.05517476536089
then after a moment of reverie he remembered where he had left dartagnan and por	30.0381990518207
he knit his brows and went direct to the tapestry which he pushed aside	129.41344947071252
the closet was empty	289.73142477686883
at the queens last word dartagnan had dragged porthos into the gallery	102.53265288313753
thither mazarin went in his turn and found the two friends walking up and down	27.856628673446128
why did you leave the closet monsieur dartagnan asked the cardinal	39.17850490064733
because replied dartagnan the queen desired every one to leave and i thought tha	56.472692897882986
and you have been here since	38.083922212738365
about a quarter of an hour said dartagnan motioning to porthos not to contradict	30.771693064135498
mazarin saw the sign and remained convinced that dartagnan had seen and heard ev	68.55591493510828
decidedly monsieur dartagnan you are the man i have been seeking	38.26712196028203
you may reckon upon me and so may your friend	131.52414473903247
then bowing to the two musketeers with his most gracious smile he reentered his 	59.04993522787645
chapter xlix	2.1818359157774503
misfortune refreshes the memory	211.32130049132928
anne of austria returned to her oratory furious	81.89535206078239
what she cried wringing her beautiful hands what the people have seen monsieur d	262.11773515663697
a prisoner at vincennes and whilst these great personages were imprisoned insult	197.96594033865296
the queen unconsciously touched here upon the exciting question	692.950717108938
the people had made no demonstration for the princes but they had risen for brou	48.44869114447879
during this time mazarin walked up and down the study glancing from time to time	51.73655584719331
ah he said it is sad i know well to be forced to yield thus but pshaw we shall h	65.43245259967378
what matters it about brousselit is a name not a thing	67.387768410807
mazarin clever politician as he was was for once mistaken broussel was a thing n	160.0209122425761
the next morning therefore when broussel made his entrance into paris in a large	61.32894671889817
the latter seemed to be maturing in her mind some great stroke a fact which incr	92.54545667817199
the coadjutor returned to parliament more a monarch than king queen and cardinal	368.83710292957693
by his advice a decree from parliament summoned the citizens to lay down their a	164.9368522350738
they now knew that it required but one hour to take up arms again and one night 	125.39772883392489
rochefort had returned to the chevalier dhumieres his fifty horsemen less two mi	139.15412905612226
but the chevalier was himself at heart a frondist and would hear nothing said of	208.41542615776663
the mendicant had gone to his old place on the steps of saint eustache and was a	49.11624495666378
no one could suspect that those two hands had been engaged with others in drawin	89.66319488225932
louvieres was proud and satisfied he had taken revenge on mazarin and had aided 	92.58844841656791
his name had been mentioned as a name of terror at the palais royal	28.643323726677295
laughingly he said to the councillor restored to his family	71.65951374065858
do you think father that if now i should ask for a company the queen would give 	80.16072486014569
dartagnan profited by this interval of calm to send away raoul whom he had great	205.35906019504415
raoul had offered some opposition at first but dartagnan made use of the comte d	112.76263714977627
rochefort alone was dissatisfied with the termination of affairs	84.35171784033027
he had written to the duc de beaufort to come and the duke was about to arrive a	22.96007039826621
he went to the coadjutor to consult with him whether it would not be better to s	37.87748891339246
let him continue his journey	84.2639588250267
all is not then over asked rochefort	72.10238617735767
my dear count we have only just begun	53.6780589086073
what induces you to think so	127.89982120278434
the knowledge that i have of the queens heart she will not rest contented beaten	240.6791498024918
is she then preparing for a stroke	130.24995531005231
i hope so	99.04500858251117
come let us see what you know	26.866943214335013
i know that she has written to the prince to return in haste from the army	56.69258536563991
ah ha said rochefort you are right	8.95755235497066
we must let monsieur de beaufort come	74.825079928817
in fact the evening after this conversation the report was circulated that the p	47.236815964547404
it was a very simple natural circumstance and yet it created a profound sensatio	51.14806027139413
it was said that madame de longueville for whom the prince had more than a broth	48.05941000179124
his confidence had unveiled the sinister project of the queen	80.8740749198793
even on the night of the princes return some citizens bolder than the rest such 	102.81112451748855
why do we not take the king and place him in the hotel de ville it is a shame to	36.68121903405123
that night the question was secretly agitated and on the morrow the gray and bla	76.38773185067444
the queen had passed the night in lonely conference with the prince who had ente	48.575039477143726
at five oclock anne went to the cardinals room	28.984085470262333
if she had not yet taken any repose he at least was already up	61.95566616321734
six days had already passed out of the ten he had asked from mordaunt he was the	48.72667659075958
anne of austria alone was permitted to enter by that door	68.32534862126707
the cardinal therefore rose to open it	122.476948910428
the queen was in a morning gown but it became her still for like diana of poicti	93.10533257515132
what is the matter madame said mazarin uneasily	13.324324368644568
you seem secretly elated	2872.2995177873195
yes giulio she said proud and happy for i have found the means of strangling thi	51.56826065764456
you are a great politician my queen said mazarin let us hear the means	31.58667719827186
and he hid what he had written by sliding the letter under a folio of blank pape	93.29242781376489
you know said the queen that they want to take the king away from me	29.6122428402299
alas yes and to hang me	221.03143677894633
they shall not have the king	32.47376427894329
nor hang me	1369.4730642367472
i want to carry off my son from them with yourself	116.38749590710978
i wish that this event which on the day it is known will completely change the a	159.97582298121935
and who is this third person	58.69420298251465
monsieur le prince	32.76421676127661
he has come then as they told me	40.05910610798392
last evening	25.787468542523296
and you have seen him	10.077205897341296
he has just left me	28.391913919119382
and will he aid this project	310.11915555175614
the plan is his own	95.52528928792314
and paris	17.082738090492775
he will starve it out and force it to surrender at discretion	137.45104829774144
the plan is not wanting in grandeur i see but one impediment	170.67065388398154
what is it	5.305421940412274
a senseless word	697.3816094071943
nothing is impossible	66.03340506580345
on paper	10442.917490529104
in execution	6382.823865120997
we have money	65.38557486099356
a little said mazarin trembling lest anne should ask to draw upon his purse	155.33746400936977
five or six thousand men	11.544225444359977
then the thing is easy	92.67440343647998
oh do think of it giulio paris this odious paris waking up one morning without q	149.28823872548452
charming charming said mazarin	54.652120022239124
i can imagine the effect i do not see the means	54.84221997272316
i will find the means myself	73.9269687979523
you are aware it will be war civil war furious devouring implacable	196.0167568161631
oh yes yes war said anne of austria	32.56940671878601
yes i will reduce this rebellious city to ashes	198.93133005939978

you are now sanguinary but take care	170.92165793985362
we are not in the time of malatesta and castruccio castracani	13.413958361802718
you will get yourself decapitated my beautiful queen and that would be a pity	102.55529209053334
you laugh	4964.61399351783
it is dangerous to go to war with a nation	60.628925089843996
look at your brother monarch charles i	91.31248011764782
he is badly off very badly	422.42016934646284
we are in france and i am spanish	22.48533998536568
so much the worse i had much rather you were french and myself also they would h	56.13850931954705
nevertheless you consent	333.2005065474533
yes if the thing be possible	80.14581903740613
it is it is i who tell you so make preparations for departure	149.88940301185
i i am always prepared to go only as you know i never do go and perhaps shall go	116.73938388544042
in short if i go will you go too	222.70829215820515
i will try	38.99922576773541
you torment me giulio with your fears and what are you afraid of then	60.43167486478561
of many things	364.04026534217815
what are they	28.857475067402817
mazarins face smiling as it was became clouded	169.0916223290653
anne said he you are but a woman and as a woman you may insult men at your ease 	70.80848025994342
you accuse me of fear i have not so much as you have since i do not fly as you d	38.839643748598
against whom do they cry out is it against you or against myself whom would they	163.14335416796771
imitate me	10.88385981594625
make less hubbub and think more deeply	604.7707915270715
you cry very loud you end by doing nothing you talk of flying	648.9796767635944
mazarin shrugged his shoulders and taking the queens hand led her to the window	28.352294619301937
look he said	71.90160559536235
well said the queen blinded by her obstinacy	24.1401290308443
well what do you see from this window if i am not mistaken those are citizens he	50.82335191028213
you will see the same at every opening from this palace to which i should lead y	62.284905704205386
your doors are guarded the airholes of your cellars are guarded and i could say 	87.01451497594297
he did get out nevertheless	425.8501989860777
do you think of escaping in the same way	27.707019454928147
i am a prisoner then	46.55668421773039
parbleu said mazarin i have been proving it to you this last hour	32.50498868864887
and he quietly resumed his dispatch at the place where he had been interrupted	60.88203973392486
anne trembling with anger and scarlet with humiliation left the room shutting th	120.62004178083296
mazarin did not even turn around	123.6001659317044
when once more in her own apartment anne fell into a chair and wept then suddenl	95.99981971300701
i am saved she exclaimed rising oh yes yes i know a man who will find the means 	48.09582667215031
then falling into a reverie she added however with an expression of joy ungratef	72.65081138838066

chapter l	2.3946686765068255
the interview	1264.7769747658253
it had been dartagnans practice ever since the riots to sleep in the same room a	93.07252965033688
as for porthos he dreamed that the panels of his carriage were not capacious eno	36.11660215541201
they were both aroused at seven oclock by the entrance of an unliveried servant 	42.41153219442704
from whom asked the gascon	32.411699059178986
from the queen replied the servant	34.720875598402
ho said porthos raising himself in his bed what does she say	28.682679529318712
dartagnan requested the servant to wait in the next room and when the door was c	39.93844148733568
friend porthos said dartagnan handing the letter to him this time at least you a	21.31002538000549
read for yourself and judge	176.4866842161309
porthos took the letter and with a trembling voice read the following words	45.2235554639638
the queen wishes to speak to monsieur dartagnan who must follow the bearer	42.31779937532165
well exclaimed porthos i see nothing in that very extraordinary	44.49153975321166
but i see much that is very extraordinary in it replied dartagnan	46.9246408478937
it is evident by their sending for me that matters are becoming complicated	180.69787866295744
just reflect a little what an agitation the queens mind must be in for her to ha	252.20973919445777
it is true said porthos	4.641187054819019
sharpen your sword baron load your pistols and give some corn to the horses for 	200.18253431412649
but stop do you think it can be a trap that they are laying for us suggested por	52.83682471858924
if it is a snare replied dartagnan i shall scent it out be assured	39.64903403705231
if mazarin is an italian i am a gascon	27.099609019607268
and dartagnan dressed himself in an instant	39.70283008785623
whilst porthos still in bed was hooking on his cloak for him a second knock at t	42.60906777025256
come in exclaimed dartagnan and another servant entered	158.46407570977036
from his eminence cardinal mazarin presenting a letter	97.49067542419218
dartagnan looked at porthos	9.048392591028371
a complicated affair said porthos where will you begin	103.32436066430373
it is arranged capitally his eminence expects me in half an hour	66.33982285869492
my friend said dartagnan turning to the servant tell his eminence that in half a	45.494933381321005
it is very fortunate resumed the gascon when the valet had retired that he did n	43.09971678982728
do you not think that they have sent for you both for the same thing	30.81927795590284
i do not think it i am certain of it	12.172309119044002
quick quick dartagnan	124.38634298563889
remember that the queen awaits you and after the queen the cardinal and after th	53.51794117725584
dartagnan summoned anne of austrias servant and signified that he was ready to f	35.75291429071979
the servant conducted him by the rue des petits champs and turning to the left e	54.46056251652845
a certain emotion for which he could not account made the lieutenants heart beat	186.86416558045013
formerly he would have approached the queen as a young man who bends before a wo	39.95966228714224
the silence of the oratory was at last disturbed by the slight rustling of silk 	58.37626075091401
the queen entered	62.49934987151964
it is you monsieur dartagnan she said fixing a gaze full of melancholy interest 	82.05592975146116
look at me well in your turn	45.465916501997164
i am the queen do you recognize me	47.3506667192181
no madame replied dartagnan	6.529033801389389
but are you no longer aware continued anne giving that sweet expression to her v	67.75950832269751
no madame i was ignorant of that said the musketeer	34.14295271084939
so much the worse sir said anne of austria so much the worse at least for the qu	12.033673042989282
what exclaimed dartagnan does the queen surrounded as she is by such devoted ser	100.65272403245608
anne understood this covert reproach and was more moved than irritated by it	201.15671904502025
she had many a time felt humiliated by the selfsacrifice and disinterestedness s	160.87964333080345
she had allowed herself to be exceeded in generosity	92.91870116470972
all that you tell me of those by whom i am surrounded monsieur dartagnan is doub	53.09668850797671
i know that you belong to the cardinal but belong to me as well and i will take 	31.33955263860639
come will you do today what formerly the gentleman you do not know did for the q	63.27685284816234
i will do everything your majesty commands replied dartagnan	46.030620629779
the queen reflected for a moment and then seeing the cautious demeanor of the mu	45.90802280950356
perhaps you like repose she said	178.40823900722972
i do not know for i have never had it madame	29.196795551589428
have you any friends	22.725707458333236
i had three two of whom have left paris to go i know not where	92.18316160711788
one alone is left to me but he is one of those known i believe to the cavalier o	70.96538687007848
very good said the queen you and your friend are worth an army	38.448269493898984
what am i to do madame	36.38195168168288
return at five oclock and i will tell you but do not breathe to a living soul si	64.3939696025366
no madame	46.888529646539986
swear it upon the cross	172.16441093217568
madame i have never been false to my word when i say i will not do a thing i mea	47.22111915759824
the queen although astonished at this language to which she was not accustomed f	75.20900831221647
it was one of the gascons artifices to hide his deep cunning occasionally under 	87.14045051095738
has the queen any further commands for me now asked dartagnan	84.0982581492364
no sir replied anne of austria and you may retire until the time that i mentione	29.015184872332224
dartagnan bowed and went out	19.96021486213548
diable he exclaimed when the door was shut they seem to have the greatest need o	78.52744197549096
then as the half hour had already glided by he crossed the gallery and knocked a	120.07344298844012
bernouin introduced him	240.36730661425918
i come for your commands my lord he said	29.672130679824235
and according to his custom dartagnan glanced rapidly around and remarked that m	110.59194576510438
but it was so placed on the desk that he could not see to whom it was addressed	40.39562184187454
you come from the queen said mazarin looking fixedly at dartagnan	24.548539482332135
i my lordwho told you that	105.75057142263746
nobody but i know it	19.912901075419015
i regret infinitely to tell you my lord that you are mistaken replied the gascon	26.4545534110786
i opened the door of the anteroom myself and i saw you enter at the end of the c	23.726698726107116
because i was shown up the private stairs	147.95803582920587
how so	22.419016160474808
i know not it must have been a mistake	28.59223985784334
mazarin was aware that it was not easy to make dartagnan reveal anything he was 	41.399902364846845
let us speak of my affairs said mazarin since you will tell me naught of yours	33.16829810748299
are you fond of traveling	36.31804481702813
my life has been passed on the high road	21.21752416344137
would anything retain you particularly in paris	380.98081648937955
nothing but an order from a superior would retain me in paris	149.9187812265258
very well	2.6909902045571163
here is a letter which must be taken to its address	45.84451821278012
to its address my lord but it has none	60.814464486827895
in fact the side of the letter opposite the seal was blank	58.88814074101837
i must tell you resumed mazarin that it is in a double envelope	53.944220739219006
i understand and i am to take off the first one when i have reached a certain pl	48.40130874589272
just so take it and go	176.15609515956504
you have a friend monsieur du vallon whom i like much let him accompany you	48.00742910815969
the devil said dartagnan to himself	28.768624166650017
he knows that we overheard his conversation yesterday and he wants to get us awa	110.64110510119777
do you hesitate asked mazarin	19.903147135619122
no my lord and i will set out at once	18.104263980267966
there is one thing only which i must request	84.93736322203678
what is it speak	90.47719826236302
that your eminence will go at once to the queen	32.27316279057216
what for	2758.5594771504207
merely to say these words i am going to send monsieur dartagnan away and i wish 	40.24488864135305
i told you said mazarin that you had seen the queen	20.113422086609102
i had the honor of saying to your eminence that there had been some mistake	45.365281830322786
what is the meaning of that	11.077204468178921
may i venture to repeat my prayer to your eminence	41.656716811601214
very well i will go	10.87945973080121
wait here for me	52.54288162889693
and looking attentively around him to see if he had left any of his keys in his 	45.797029312186275
ten minutes elapsed during which dartagnan made every effort to read through the	43.98260279278767
but he did not succeed	17.792898881811833
mazarin returned pale and evidently thoughtful	216.48278396209204
he seated himself at his desk and dartagnan proceeded to examine his face as he 	43.458790933207815
ah thought the gascon he looks displeased	216.89753407689733
can it be with me he meditates	42.19569296453016
is it about sending me to the bastile all very fine my lord but at the very firs	48.51369792443806
i should be carried home in triumph like monsieur broussel and athos would procl	88.75192239935542
it would be exceedingly droll	97.69030953117833
the gascon with his vivid imagination had already seen the advantage to be deriv	66.5025222685868
mazarin gave however no order of the kind but on the contrary began to be insinu	67.24104845958631
you were right he said my dear monsieur dartagnan and you can not set out yet	38.79335237336876
i beg you to return me that dispatch	53.9080154610928
dartagnan obeyed and mazarin ascertained that the seal was intact	74.7307674603104
i shall want you this evening he said return in two hours	67.3876720119
my lord said dartagnan i have an appointment in two hours which i can not miss	18.22068726468656
do not be uneasy said mazarin it is the same	14.668611713811604
good thought dartagnan i fancied it was so	37.572008822002275
return then at five oclock and bring that worthy monsieur du vallon with you	82.07796138773655
only leave him in the anteroom as i wish to speak to you alone	35.54971537496444
dartagnan bowed and thought both at the same hour both commands alike both at th	147.17045216230358
monsieur de gondy would pay a hundred thousand francs for such a secret	26.13993476043212
you are thoughtful said mazarin uneasily	59.20641467211539
yes i was thinking whether we ought to come armed or not	138.0570686977606
armed to the teeth replied mazarin	101.19344261252384
very well my lord it shall be so	12.660757171833287
dartagnan saluted went out and hastened to repeat to his friend mazarins flatter	78.0313368375655
chapter li	2.1782617584272828
the flight	2388.4068304052184
when dartagnan returned to the palais royal at five oclock it presented in spite	45.55274033153684
nor was that surprising	125.75191134832092
the queen had restored broussel and blancmesnil to the people and had therefore 	63.883925698623415
the return also of the conqueror of lens was the pretext for giving a grand banq	73.94501957769364
the princes and princesses were invited and their carriages had crowded the cour	104.75598984634757
anne of austria had never appeared more brilliant than on that dayradiant with g	79.47067974913007
mazarin disappeared as they rose from table	187.32540040663062
he found dartagnan waiting for him already at his post in the anteroom	49.87243335835843
the cardinal advanced to him with a smile and taking him by the hand led him int	36.59002099236661
my dear m	9.65011123635187
dartagnan said the minister sitting down i am about to give you the greatest pro	47.974339081470255
i hope said dartagnan bowing that you give it my lord without hesitation and wit	68.88691319441288
more worthy than any one in paris my dear friend therefore i apply to you	62.988847529383335
we are about to leave this evening continued mazarin	27.342124253674037
my dear m	8.406736318155676
dartagnan the welfare of the state is deposited in your hands	65.50722078139451
he paused	1091.013714637474
explain yourself my lord i am listening	22.25899615001171
the queen has resolved to make a little excursion with the king to saint germain	35.14887892935816
aha said dartagnan that is to say the queen wishes to leave paris	26.88654502589162
a womans capriceyou understand	817.2402326298893
yes i understand perfectly said dartagnan	24.994965418063977
it was for this she summoned you this morning and that she told you to return at	73.37013463756115
was it worth while to wish me to swear this morning that i would mention the app	92.0290477203512
oh women women whether queens or not they are always the same	249.71194105062375
do you disapprove of this journey my dear m	26.558448196796814
dartagnan asked mazarin anxiously	99.92822049288445
i my lord said dartagnan why should i	23.957357800170406
because you shrug your shoulders	251.14645688019456
it is a way i have of speaking to myself	43.165542230212154
i neither approve nor disapprove my lord i merely await your commands	313.4403712048732
good it is you accordingly that i have pitched upon to conduct the king and the 	86.98692733371047
liar thought dartagnan	96.41246167165036
you see therefore continued the cardinal perceiving dartagnans composure that as	150.41701276568278
yes my lord and i feel the whole responsibility of such a charge	51.38832080303422
you accept however	1541.0378414591894
i always accept	1545.4273068382658
do you think the thing possible	26.024861081791208
everything is possible	117.7366954848184
shall you be attacked on the road	36.0313262220578
and what will you do in that case	15.71474325922635
i shall pass through those who attack me	166.5463211188947
and suppose you can not pass through them	65.62577589516722
so much the worse for them i shall pass over them	27.025795313958895
and you will place the king and queen in safety also at saint germain	89.82105593155896
on your life	262.2681382243161
on my life	53.57039635739269
you are a hero my friend said mazarin gazing at the musketeer with admiration	25.462758901723763
dartagnan smiled	131.91368260142497
and i asked mazarin after a moments silence	32.82454652693084
how and you my lord	77.27195225991353
if i wish to leave	21.960770820315602
that would be much more difficult	41.78477440047514
why so	26.955203004247423
your eminence might be recognized	118.98806220462536
even under this disguise asked mazarin raising a cloak which covered an armchair	119.4560467342241
if your eminence is disguised it will be almost easy	60.343878511116884
ah said mazarin breathing more freely	33.01259364856115
but it will be necessary for your eminence to do what the other day you declared	35.17845652135451
i will down with mazarin	83.20183615955668
in french in good french my lord take care of your accent they killed six thousa	102.68251659171978
take care that the french do not take their revenge on you for the sicilian vesp	29.817631460890514
i will do my best	26.271766473607535
the streets are full of armed men continued dartagnan	71.34784624874344
are you sure that no one is aware of the queens project	38.218724560004716
mazarin reflected	1084.017739107709
this affair would give a fine opportunity for a traitor my lord the chance of be	135.15962272077022
mazarin shuddered but he reflected that a man who had the least intention to bet	55.52594958090565
and therefore added he quietly i have not confidence in every one the proof of w	91.17903690920025
shall you not go with the queen	18.003026534493184
no replied mazarin	4.5520353165431375
then you will start after the queen	56.399145846541316
no said mazarin again	34.63654980404731
ah said dartagnan who began to understand	29.56016390577453
yes continued the cardinal	25.85450956120288
i have my plan	49.02350566408901
with the queen i double her risk after the queen her departure would double mine	501.63923336519497
the great are often ungrateful	611.9994339382895
very true said dartagnan fixing his eyes in spite of himself on the queens diamo	20.614417807734675
mazarin followed the direction of his eyes and gently turned the hoop of the rin	38.43561225210964
i wish he said with his cunning smile to prevent them from being ungrateful to m	71.81056708414995
it is but christian charity replied dartagnan not to lead ones neighbors into te	92.25505827322267
it is exactly for that reason said mazarin that i wish to start before them	39.760926870372636
dartagnan smiledhe was just the man to understand the astute italian	132.0863968621693
mazarin saw the smile and profited by the moment	72.70577534320337
you will begin therefore by taking me first out of paris will you not my dear m	84.30700279512791
a difficult commission my lord replied dartagnan resuming his serious manner	221.50770672087432
but said mazarin you did not make so many difficulties with regard to the king a	42.20292689506195
the king and the queen are my king and queen replied the musketeer my life is th	56.972526502851814
if they ask it what have i to say	63.1223460765699
that is true murmured mazarin in a low tone but as thy life is not mine i suppos	23.76429586131315
dartagnan smiled	118.18510512075227
these two men met at one point and that was cunning had they been actuated equal	106.32481073120209
but also said mazarin you must understand that if i ask this service from you it	72.241764159301
is it still only an intention your eminence asked dartagnan	90.81680772770504
stay said mazarin drawing the ring from his finger my dear dartagnan there is a 	22.986651616158355
dartagnan spared mazarin the trouble of insisting and after looking to see if th	120.40879772528373
i valued it much said mazarin giving a last look at it nevertheless i give it to	57.53000582168477
and i my lord said dartagnan accept it as it is given	48.650932346878626
come let us speak of your little affairs	64.19900945484694
you wish to leave before everybody and at what hour	113.65549960556605
at ten oclock	8.09744775197606
and the queen at what time is it her wish to start	106.70777390169327
at midnight	201.42633603812743
then it is possible	19.095111751320612
i can get you out of paris and leave you beyond the barriere and can return for 	80.86081007300298
capital but how will you get me out of paris	32.67465443923887
oh as to that you must leave it to me	31.67154319573025
i give you absolute power therefore take as large an escort as you like	291.65829246891946
dartagnan shook his head	11.878825351833251
it seems to me however said mazarin the safest method	42.65567130563444
yes for you my lord but not for the queen you must leave it to me and give me th	25.595642032323074
or find some one else continued dartagnan turning his back	126.979070544725
oh muttered mazarin i do believe he is going off with the diamond m	72.50725587435315
dartagnan my dear m	50.684097936319255
dartagnan he called out in a coaxing voice will you answer for everything	82.79692274983397
i will answer for nothing	40.07638729519868
i will do my best	25.869523734893985
well then let us goi must trust to you	66.9701180731789
it is very fortunate said dartagnan to himself	11.44612672864819
you will be here at halfpast nine	60.29368840993886
and i shall find your eminence ready	48.64361374783693
certainly quite ready	1385.261882346144
well then it is a settled thing and now my lord will you obtain for me an audien	28.572252817063358
for what purpose	24.815281097197758
i wish to receive her majestys commands from her own lips	60.368658186752455
she desired me to give them to you	35.20957839574595
she may have forgotten something	170.83056321372007
you really wish to see her	71.11955507463112
it is indispensable my lord	41.366208305912835
mazarin hesitated for one instant but dartagnan was firm	91.68429302265395
come then said the minister i will conduct you to her but remember not one word 	46.17871854524618
what has passed between us concerns ourselves alone my lord replied dartagnan	124.45540135216959
swear to be mute	158.99563409427236
i never swear my lord i say yes or no and as i am a gentleman i keep my word	90.96511781948668
come then i see that i must trust unreservedly to you	41.716688029477474
believe me my lord it will be your best plan	27.999314372902855
come said mazarin conducting dartagnan into the queens oratory and desiring him 	96.99254066298461
he did not wait long for in five minutes the queen entered in full gala costume	51.42814274648047
thus dressed she scarcely appeared thirtyfive years of age	161.64876331074996
she was still exceedingly handsome	144.15073567190382
it is you monsieur dartagnan she said smiling graciously i thank you for having 	44.86394229254991
i ought to ask your majestys pardon but i wished to receive your commands from y	31.66506502799772
do you accept the commission which i have intrusted to you	36.286453592063374
with gratitude	3033.655981064018
very well be here at midnight	78.78608634504536
i will not fail	31.18608257020345
monsieur dartagnan continued the queen i know your disinterestedness too well to	41.19587999006126
your majesty is free to forget or to remember as it pleases you and i know not w	47.13746468189022
go sir said the queen with her most bewitching smile go and return at midnight	27.217760622432206
and dartagnan retired but as he passed out he glanced at the curtain through whi	61.23228408608967
good thought he mazarin has been listening to discover whether i betrayed him	93.03605607676921
in truth that italian puppet does not deserve the services of an honest man	42.95021755451319
dartagnan was not less exact to his appointment and at halfpast nine oclock he e	86.87533858011206
he found the cardinal dressed as an officer and he looked very well in that cost	78.52399712924345
quite alone he asked	149.94294572759466
yes my lord	5.56602017796167
and that worthy monsieur du vallon are we not to enjoy his society	65.26424819642014
certainly my lord he is waiting in his carriage at the gate of the garden of the	15.72609232286214
and we start in his carriage then	138.28753678158395
yes my lord	5.8907650706506365
and with us no other escort but you two	225.6531746528886
is it not enough one of us would suffice	60.46222761773419
really my dear monsieur dartagnan said the cardinal your coolness startles me	25.37293033454534
i should have thought on the contrary that it ought to have inspired you with co	39.691557810578324
and bernouindo i not take him with me	66.33567902678827
there is no room for him he will rejoin your eminence	70.24578678880043
let us go said mazarin since everything must be done as you wish	29.29222718265053
my lord there is time to draw back said dartagnan and your eminence is perfectly	47.225431318663254
not at all not at all said mazarin let us be off	22.374951674050166
and so they descended the private stair mazarin leaning on the arm of dartagnan 	54.907871615272086
at last after crossing the courts of the palais royal where there still remained	95.74938446957705
mazarin attempted to open it by a key which he took from his pocket but with suc	59.78062147797385
give it to me said dartagnan who when the gate was open deposited the key in his	46.407385208101225
the steps were already down and the door open	82.57986678450024
mousqueton stood at the door and porthos was inside the carriage	37.25320600979926
mount my lord said dartagnan to mazarin who sprang into the carriage without wai	23.242051252975624
dartagnan followed him and mousqueton having closed the door mounted behind the 	67.23344995073018
he had made some difficulties about going under pretext that he still suffered f	188.94041732419117
remain if you like my dear monsieur mouston but i warn you that paris will be bu	25.336774789435513
the carriage started at a measured pace without betraying by the slightest sign 	99.11979926910293
the cardinal wiped his forehead with his handkerchief and looked around him	29.84815212117409
on his left was porthos whilst dartagnan was on his right each guarded a door an	145.8174642496838
before him on the front seat lay two pairs of pistolsone in front of porthos and	72.7275506193927
about a hundred paces from the palais royal a patrol stopped the carriage	36.95922800022731
who goes asked the captain	38.51095716263262
mazarin replied dartagnan bursting into a laugh	102.18781646973683
the cardinals hair stood on end	205.00605836623757
but the joke appeared an excellent one to the citizens who seeing the conveyance	135.93976660080705
a good journey to ye they cried allowing it to pass	227.9987992626821
hem said dartagnan what does my lord think of that reply	54.72179715273718
man of talent cried mazarin	24.489491198218268
in truth said porthos i understand but now	29.845867858945567
about the middle of the rue des petits champs they were stopped by a second patr	16.920695594884805
who goes there inquired the captain of the patrol	53.1202272456497
keep back my lord said dartagnan	13.251651430616514
and mazarin buried himself so far behind the two friends that he disappeared com	72.92037938974237
who goes there cried the same voice impatiently whilst dartagnan perceived that 	133.99185143087192
but putting his head out of the carriage	49.88111418949586
eh planchet said he	9.607908809465927
the chief approached and it was indeed planchet dartagnan had recognized the voi	44.87045687148778
how sir said planchet is it you	37.92152107392733
eh mon dieu yes my good friend this worthy porthos has just received a sword wou	57.09893697410133
oh really said planchet	19.198791528241472
porthos said dartagnan if you can still speak say a word my dear porthos to this	49.076867551882
planchet my friend said porthos in a melancholy voice i am very ill should you m	29.637408695605096
oh good heaven said planchet what a misfortune and how did it happen	55.25743740184341
i will tell you all about it replied mousqueton	16.04558954616177
porthos uttered a deep groan	54.6227060180039
make way for us planchet said dartagnan in a whisper to him or he will not arriv	28.423665481297576
planchet shook his head with the air of a man who says in that case things look 	31.299036150606224
then he exclaimed turning to his men	60.58274430792509
let them pass they are friends	184.2109593863358
the carriage resumed its course and mazarin who had held his breath ventured to 	83.15907887194588
bricconi muttered he	208.30285877940068
a few steps in advance of the gate of saint honore they met a third troop this l	29.561820159857664
attention porthos cried dartagnan	12.563566249699711
porthos placed his hand on the pistols	18.456356736606054
what is it asked mazarin	6.742588676143849
my lord i think we are in bad company	36.8642624414674
a man advanced to the door with a kind of scythe in his hand	28.37034203695776
qui vive he asked	47.294411818998675
eh rascal said dartagnan do you not recognize his highness the princes carriage	52.02241585255726
prince or not said the man open	133.01785660052826
we are here to guard the gate and no one whom we do not know shall pass	62.00803806349463
what is to be done said porthos	8.00985565994717
pardieu pass replied dartagnan	229.80980790395114
but how asked mazarin	44.06540682214197
through or over coachman gallop on	2137.713145092398
the coachman raised his whip	153.62007043861485
not a step further said the man who appeared to be the captain or i will hamstri	40.28736949266834
peste said porthos it would be a pity animals which cost me a hundred pistoles e	55.487095186216166
i will pay you two hundred for them said mazarin	28.457053694103813
yes but when once they are hamstrung our necks will be strung next	131.8310561214788
if one of them comes to my side asked porthos must i kill him	61.9056409283263
yes by a blow of your fist if you can we will not fire but at the last extremity	80.91330377904457
i can do it said porthos	20.812721755595813
come and open then cried dartagnan to the man with the scythe taking one of the 	66.32002337274344
and as the man approached dartagnan in order to have more freedom for his action	56.18154347157876
without doubt he recognized dartagnan for he became deadly pale doubtless the mu	147.0157245493349
monsieur dartagnan he cried falling back a step it is monsieur dartagnan let him	45.097612516439135
dartagnan was perhaps about to reply when a blow similar to that of a mallet fal	90.02172423358961
the noise was caused by porthos who had just knocked down his man	77.06508068370671
dartagnan turned around and saw the unfortunate man upon his back about four pac	83.09165588965233
sdeath cried he to the coachman	66.73008743499557
spur your horses whip get on	197.44442142802984
the coachman bestowed a heavy blow of the whip upon his horses the noble animals	156.17761532734312
there was a moments silence then the carriage cleared the gate	25.741588412626424
to cours la reine cried dartagnan to the coachman then turning to mazarin he sai	22.61906758758213
you are safeyou are free	71.26216405147922
mazarin replied only by a groan he could not believe in such a miracle	62.67309825144891
five minutes later the carriage stopped having reached cours la reine	48.78151806313128
is my lord pleased with his escort asked dartagnan	82.91983819629691
enchanted monsieur said mazarin venturing his head out of one of the windows and	31.41331254797316
it will not be so difficult replied dartagnan springing to the ground	31.313374457829102
monsieur du vallon i commend his eminence to your care	44.27405484806333
be quite at ease said porthos holding out his hand which dartagnan took and shoo	34.47166794930814
oh cried porthos as if in pain	46.436737229855304
dartagnan looked with surprise at his friend	40.76055383889403
what is the matter then he asked	8.390877064932198
i think i have sprained my wrist said porthos	48.20178305718006
the devil why you strike like a blind or a deaf man	119.18521945527792
it was necessary my man was going to fire a pistol at me but youhow did you get 	105.92422903662278
oh mine replied dartagnan was not a man	63.80672017454276
what was it then	22.893121329576957
it was an apparition	44.299417038507436
i charmed it away	350.00613657754167
without further explanation dartagnan took the pistols which were upon the front	162.16772726425546
chapter lii	2.5758442987813472
the carriage of monsieur le coadjuteur	53.01514973840865
instead of returning then by the saint honore gate dartagnan who had time before	102.51783986548436
he was approached to be examined and when it was discovered by his plumed hat an	51.17157695701143
he walked down the rue richelieu meditating how he should carry off the queen in	112.70984794414963
he was struck by a sudden idea	52.45307580999202
ah pardieu he exclaimed that would be fair play	122.7238857026245
and approaching the carriage he examined the arms on the panels and the livery o	55.24442262785415
this scrutiny was so much the more easy the coachman being sound asleep	287.4033887193046
it is in truth monsieur le coadjuteurs carriage said dartagnan upon my honor i b	53.68217997337788
he mounted noiselessly into the chariot and pulled the silk cord which was attac	106.66020961896908
to the palais royal he called out	46.13220329103755
the coachman awoke with a start and drove off in the direction he was desired ne	73.16502138417452
the porter at the palace was about to close the gates but seeing such a handsome	98.41158540699979
it was then only the coachman perceived the grooms were not behind the vehicle h	75.94207181086797
dartagnan in his turn sprang to the ground and just at the moment when the coach	33.653164132947836
pronounce one single word muttered dartagnan and you are a dead man	42.82773625220168
the coachman perceived at once by the expression of the man who thus addressed h	48.156123199346474
two musketeers were pacing the court to whom dartagnan called by their names	112.79318231404483
monsieur de belliere said he to one of them do me the favor to take the reins fr	36.222619477240215
the musketeer who knew that his lieutenant was incapable of jesting with regard 	112.12576930449438
then turning toward the second musketeer dartagnan said	52.01522254585191
monsieur du verger help me to place this man in a place of safety	72.10922834026896
the musketeer thinking that his lieutenant had just arrested some prince in disg	187.27029578310265
dartagnan mounted the staircase followed by his prisoner who in his turn was fol	52.596650806670695
bernouin was waiting there impatient for news of his master	146.68717101312316
well sir he said	16.42162794537041
everything goes on capitally my dear monsieur bernouin but here is a man whom i 	45.36283749689309
where then sir	391.77095705337194
where you like provided that the place which you shall choose has iron shutters 	321.56434091233376
we have that sir replied bernouin and the poor coachman was conducted to a close	77.03906784912796
and now my good friend said dartagnan to him i must invite you to deprive yourse	29.97560695092192
the coachman as we can well understand made no resistance in fact he was so asto	87.79781560291873
and now monsieur du verger he said shut yourself up with this man until monsieur	145.65186553815755
the duty will be tolerably long and not very amusing i know but added he serious	240.21560283909605
at your command lieutenant replied the musketeer who saw the business was a seri	81.56420916040017
bythebye continued dartagnan should this man attempt to fly or to call out pass 	217.94214987656042
the musketeer signified by a nod that these commands should be obeyed to the let	212.2594916964802
midnight struck	1251.2506874062237
lead me into the queens oratory said dartagnan announce to her i am here and put	64.41586630151573
bernouin conducted dartagnan to the oratory where he sat down pensively	86.6892481947595
everything had gone on as usual at the palais royal	50.6467961829287
as we said before by ten oclock almost all the guests had dispersed those who we	110.12738540460981
at ten oclock anne of austria had entered the kings room	19.233707212980313
monsieur had just retired and the youthful louis remaining the last was amusing 	339.6912993061477
two royal pages were playing with him	145.1300356896404

a few minutes after twelve oclock bernouin knocked at the queens bedroom door ha	82.10763321871418
anne of austria opened the door to him herself	43.40185102116416
she was dressed that is to say in dishabille wrapped in a long warm dressinggown	90.60239918936543
it is you bernouin she said	38.95264203575256

go and tell laporte to wake and dress the king and then pass on to the marechal 	60.0048957718212
bernouin bowed and retired	23.343935277865807
the queen entered her oratory which was lighted by a single lamp of venetian cry	56.058874758887534
is it you she said	43.57260407825294
yes madame	42.87231993181192

he is awaiting your majesty at cours la reine	48.684233690275164

i have provided for everything a carriage below is waiting for your majesty	139.31559524779783
let us go to the king	5.706376203242549
dartagnan bowed and followed the queen	49.678378181568995
the young louis was already dressed with the exception of his shoes and doublet 	58.35302234232579
the bedclothes were thrown back exposing the kings bed linen which was so worn t	159.7886592195668
it was one of the results of mazarins niggardliness	19.642642801415576
the queen entered and dartagnan remained at the door	24.668680871632844
as soon as the child perceived the queen he escaped from laporte and ran to meet	51.67361188185175
anne then motioned to dartagnan to approach and he obeyed	51.52717541149479
my son said anne of austria pointing to the musketeer calm standing uncovered he	84.04886801121305
remember his name well and look at him well that his face may not be forgotten f	62.148821796007454
the young king looked at the officer with his largeformed eye and repeated	42.57290765926824
monsieur dartagnan	2.8680702358537586
that is it my son	24.299990045697623
the young king slowly raised his little hand and held it out to the musketeer th	41.249807819862866
monsieur dartagnan repeated louis very well madame	138.60210114246308
at this moment they were startled by a noise as if a tumult were approaching	45.878469002028524
what is that exclaimed the queen	22.916800085523825
oh oh replied dartagnan straining both at the same time his quick ear and his in	76.24475393080348
we must fly said the queen	28.153757207837838
your majesty has given me the control of this business we had better wait and se	47.44890618782674
monsieur dartagnan	2.965969556469182
i will answer for everything	33.88494836785943
nothing is so catching as confidence	322.9320657849683
the queen full of energy and courage was quickly alive to these two virtues in o	107.68955795186463
do as you like she said i rely upon you	49.242432221946025
will your majesty permit me to give orders in your name throughout this business	48.864094076623594
command sir	178.6157643611818
what do the people want this time demanded the king	61.84291552537765
we are about to ascertain sire replied dartagnan as he rapidly left the room	55.293995274504255
the tumult continued to increase and seemed to surround the palais royal entirel	47.68470382777276
cries were heard from the interior of which they could not comprehend the sense	66.95469580411667
it was evident that there was clamor and sedition	27.47422129292236
the king half dressed the queen and laporte remained each in the same state and 	73.15500927042875
comminges who was on guard that night at the palais royal ran in	41.58912665656374
he had about two hundred men in the courtyards and stables and he placed them at	50.242668387608205
well asked anne of austria when dartagnan reappeared what does it mean	53.10512022924326
it means madame that the report has spread that the queen has left the palais ro	72.12841736563027
oh this time it is too much exclaimed the queen and i will prove to them i have 	32.39589234495613
dartagnan saw from the expression of the queens face that she was about to issue	42.907036168171906
he approached her and said in a low voice	40.64368694057331
has your majesty still confidence in me	88.13072976408914
this voice startled her	865.4106184859477
yes sir she replied every confidence speak	320.3752942143085
will the queen deign to follow my advice	74.84791821571014
let your majesty dismiss m	171.78063756740187
de comminges and desire him to shut himself up with his men in the guardhouse an	74.6676855652965
comminges glanced at dartagnan with the envious look with which every courtier s	92.30478109098594
you hear comminges said the queen	17.197519981645534
dartagnan went up to him with his usual quickness he caught the anxious glance	44.28026206841045
monsieur de comminges he said pardon me we both are servants of the queen are we	62.871428496998135
comminges bowed and left	25.89900398121947
come said dartagnan to himself i have got one more enemy	50.19658319061308
and now said the queen addressing dartagnan what is to be done for you hear that	22.015454000729175
madame said dartagnan the people want to see the king and they must see him	26.69373979567805
what must see him whereon the balcony	336.19050373693756
not at all madame but here sleeping in his bed	144.64352267564777
oh your majesty exclaimed laporte monsieur dartagnan is right	31.444941713246333
the queen became thoughtful and smiled like a woman to whom duplicity is no stra	79.59271809299366
without doubt she murmured	406.5322452578732
monsieur laporte said dartagnan go and announce to the people through the gratin	25.860045601313296
but not every one a deputation of two or four people	122.8970493513785
every one madame	367.4567852272077
but reflect they will keep us here till daybreak	245.20164610578848
it shall take but a quarter of an hour i answer for everything madame believe me	74.18333546452463
before the sleeping king they will be mute gentle and timid as lambs	177.63364635058505
go laporte said the queen	11.36107666676914
the young king approached his mother and said why do as these people ask	187.16084912149222
it must be so my son said anne of austria	17.23279329621567
but if they say it must be to me am i no longer king	54.33552358226753
the queen remained silent	107.28951310227123
sire said dartagnan will your majesty permit me to ask you a question	13.061578329382423
louis xiv	1.9911974677157027
turned around astonished that any one should dare to address him	172.57603090829156
but the queen pressed the childs hand	91.9615367586266
yes sir	23.0835082271635
he said	34.0600305045589
does your majesty remember when playing in the park of fontainebleau or in the p	34.62191972404138
yes certainly	418.55507856880797
well then this noise of thunder however much your majesty may have wished to con	97.0988343040103
you must do so	27.192704306633072
certainly sir but they tell me that the noise of thunder is the voice of god	48.56667857623367
well then sire continued dartagnan listen to the noise of the people you will pe	31.73874352717107
in truth at that moment a terrible murmur was wafted to them by the night breeze	45.33428316609626
hold sire said dartagnan they have just told the people that you are asleep you 	61.675468173094764
the queen looked with surprise at this strange man whose brilliant courage made 	93.12597904225225
laporte entered	190.39714532643254
well laporte asked the queen	24.892284253743146
madame he replied monsieur dartagnans prediction has been accomplished they are 	102.28702393480674
the doors are about to be opened and in five minutes they will be here	52.12137504905706
laporte said the queen suppose you put one of your sons in the kings place we mi	38.226333882503596
if your majesty desires it said laporte my sons like myself are at the queens se	80.46874766057037
not at all said dartagnan should one of them know his majesty and discover but a	89.92759448780458
you are right sir always right said anne of austria	34.7234005112605
laporte place the king in bed	145.419733033979
laporte placed the king dressed as he was in the bed and then covered him as far	39.09940219462346
the queen bent over him and kissed his brow	47.532535408114676
pretend to sleep louis said she	120.32224644074158
yes said the king but i do not wish to be touched by any of those men	15.83485036221278
sire i am here said dartagnan and i give you my word that if a single man has th	22.25700082315287
and now what is to be done asked the queen for i hear them	22.479497338718296
monsieur laporte go to them and again recommend silence	307.3815498871956
madame wait at the door whilst i shall be at the head of the kings bed ready to 	49.651404309509104
laporte went out the queen remained standing near the hangings whilst dartagnan 	72.1959634325872
then the heavy and collected steps of a multitude of men were heard and the quee	69.00928141130893
on seeing the queen the men stopped short respectfully	138.9586553009353
enter gentlemen enter said the queen	67.9500831996345
there was then amongst that crowd a moments hesitation which looked like shame	207.18704385227218
they had expected resistance they had expected to be thwarted to have to force t	85.90309774766156
the gates had opened of themselves and the king ostensibly at least had no other	106.85395682814922
the foremost of them stammered and attempted to fall back	209.13488595832192
enter gentlemen said laporte since the queen desires you so to do	57.644952715463766
then one more bold than the rest ventured to pass the door and to advance on tip	88.40616437680684
this example was imitated by the rest until the room filled silently as if these	110.36778858738442
far beyond the door the heads of those who were not able to enter could be seen 	60.32483299454169
dartagnan saw it all through an opening he had made in the curtain and in the ve	66.22414597814577
sir said the queen to him thinking he was the leader of the band you wished to s	41.46203442355301
approach and look at him and say if we have the appearance of people who wish to	50.18245121080847
no certainly replied planchet rather astonished at the unexpected honor conferre	93.34862966476818
you will say then to my good and faithful parisians continued anne with a smile 	38.522087024572194
i shall tell them madame and those who accompany me will say the same thing but	57.127368928699696
but what asked anne of austria	15.213152341835183
will your majesty pardon me said planchet but is it really the king who is lying	30.54367857100892
anne of austria started	65.31362384854093
if she said there is one among you who knows the king let him approach and say w	63.465320434707415
a man wrapped in a cloak in the folds of which his face was hidden approached an	41.44636915249681
for one second dartagnan thought the man had some evil design and he put his han	76.47483605145354
it is certainly the king said the man rising again	52.389822187652456
god bless his majesty	89.7234565567516
yes repeated the leader in a whisper god bless his majesty and all these men who	63.510912313193224
now said planchet let us thank the queen	19.137922518113296
my friends retire	895.3562292681999
they all bowed and retired by degrees as noiselessly as they had entered	63.41362267942257
planchet who had been the first to enter was the last to leave	35.151133260860206
the queen stopped him	61.331198542128924
what is your name my friend she said	15.801172596092309
planchet much surprised at the inquiry turned back	446.8122657630937
yes continued the queen i think myself as much honored to have received you this	55.61371014296765
yes thought planchet to treat me as a prince	80.99405857744794
no thank you	22.680926612467154
dartagnan trembled lest planchet seduced like the crow in the fable should tell 	201.3033366812108
madame replied planchet respectfully i am called dulaurier at your service	33.3027359099705
thank you monsieur dulaurier said the queen and what is your business	13.426545734507936
madame i am a clothier in the rue bourdonnais	19.679557416539858

the different actors in this strange scene remained facing one another without u	203.35734898166868
the queen breathed more freely	246.6945802694918
dartagnan wiped his damp forehead and the king slid off his bed saying let us go	46.83178537837943
at this moment laporte reappeared	11.002038649365758
well asked the queen	15.787766722647815

dartagnan mounted the box having a pair of pistols in his belt a musket under hi	78.7719995544706

the blinds were pulled down and they started at a gallop by the rue richelieu	55.73253453003248
on reaching the gate the captain of the post advanced at the head of a dozen men	31.671082582935803
dartagnan signed to them to draw near	144.59573338745415

anne gave a quick glance to mazarin who answered by an almost imperceptible shak	50.59106388615544
what do you say of this asked the queen	8.712083748026508
i say that she is a hostage for the parisians answered the cardinal	26.91592643187067

the prince bowed low	90.33205269894736
it was then three oclock in the morning	7.309484973927583
the queen walked first every one followed her	264.2525436296199
about two hundred persons had accompanied her in her flight	103.00161257396968
gentlemen said the queen laughing pray take up your abode in the chateau it is l	39.31643173848242

but your eminence replied the prince	40.67090616084211
i answered mazarin i shall not sleep at all i have work to do	52.77079327639985
gaston desired that he should be shown into the room wherein he was to sleep wit	78.21789837389846
well for my part i shall go to bed said dartagnan come porthos	36.249211289026825
porthos followed the lieutenant with that profound confidence he ever had in the	106.96718102524734
they walked from one end of the chateau to the other porthos looking with wonder	67.74732845272939
four hundred at a pistole each four hundred pistoles	44.45343233299147
yes interposed porthos four hundred pistoles but who is to make four hundred pis	102.67008078361678
a pistole is not enough said dartagnan tis worth a louis	74.82400955511866
what is worth a louis	103.89196434868316
four hundred at a louis each make four hundred louis	153.43939143574704
four hundred said porthos	35.715180716403964
yes there are two hundred of them and each of them will need two which will make	75.6476249357209
but four hundred what	1836.0920161486144
listen cried dartagnan	12.875066432647374
but as there were all kinds of people about who were in a state of stupefaction 	46.29755753586188
i understand answered porthos i understand you perfectly on my honor two hundred	44.76553655366134
let them say what they will besides how will they know that we are doing it	87.29291264686714
but who will distribute these things asked porthos	86.83350901013453
is nt mousqueton there	186.43491184564965
but he wears my livery my livery will be known replied porthos	118.18240010932475
he can turn his coat inside out	491.82242817480216
you are always in the right my dear friend cried porthos but where the devil do 	24.713679834602456
dartagnan smiled	120.73961950698742
the two friends turned down the first street they came to	32.39635577522813
porthos knocked at the door of a house to the right whilst dartagnan knocked at 	37.809711030101816
some straw they said	888.6545829072681
sir we do nt keep any was the reply of the people who opened the doors but pleas	52.28001919456005
where is the hay dealers	61.95318462075774
at the last large door in the street	51.348382785484006
are there any other people in saint germain who sell straw	117.72771323046199
yes there s the landlord of the lamb and groslouis the farmer they both live in 	92.40919812849187
very well	2.698028726931127
dartagnan went instantly to the hay dealer and bargained with him for a hundred 	62.80356173645608
he went afterward to the innkeeper and bought from him two hundred trusses at th	76.62650265793883
finally farmer louis sold them eighty trusses making in all four hundred and thi	272.0303494872056
there was no more to be had in saint germain	33.42434398463754
this foraging did not occupy more than half an hour	75.4909121027884
mousqueton duly instructed was put at the head of this sudden and new business	274.3042207951408
he was cautioned not to let a bit of straw out of his hands under a louis the tr	52.37660868628526
dartagnan taking with him three trusses of straw returned to the chateau where e	84.99416501649833
the lieutenants entrance produced a burst of laughter in the great drawingroom b	106.10910015907356
straw they all cried out straw where is there any to be found	208.11591083988228

and he conducted them to mousqueton who freely distributed the trusses at the ra	62.84487232918691
it was thought rather dear but people wanted to sleep and who would not give eve	192.31557267451205
dartagnan gave up his bed to any one who wanted it making it over about a dozen 	87.19427671539661
at five oclock in the morning the straw was worth eighty francs a truss and ther	34.41410307769951
dartagnan had taken the precaution to set apart four trusses for his own use	64.065891561232
he put in his pocket the key of the room where he had hidden them and accompanie	31.103785458968776
mousqueton who knew nothing of what was going on in the chateau wondered that th	41.42256137448699
dartagnan put the gold in his hat and in going back to the chateau settled the r	60.50670080785782
porthos however found that he had no straw left for himself	111.88697864536974
he returned to mousqueton but the steward had sold the last wisp	77.47572168368734
he then repaired to dartagnan who thanks to his four trusses of straw was in the	62.51750193255615
dartagnan could on no account consent to pull his bed to pieces again for portho	89.14067843218366
he laid his sword at the head his pistols by his side stretched his cloak over h	57.053622185040645
he was already enjoying the sweet dream engendered by the possession of two hund	98.70917177323251
monsieur dartagnan it cried	71.53937062374561
here cried porthos here	38.18022730965992
porthos foresaw that if dartagnan was called away he should remain the sole poss	183.32854464142528
an officer approached	170.70996596976755
i am come to fetch you monsieur dartagnan	18.978132069074057
from whom	65.65535426285352
his eminence sent me	49.05843049678239
tell my lord that i m going to sleep and i advise him as a friend to do the same	33.482536294425486
his eminence is not gone to bed and will not go to bed and wants you instantly	72.43081816500928
the devil take mazarin who does not know when to sleep at the proper time	54.27561570595222
what does he want with me is it to make me a captain in that case i will forgive	32.340398209177465
and the musketeer rose grumbling took his sword hat pistols and cloak and follow	129.4692465597141
monsieur dartagnan said the cardinal on perceiving him i have not forgotten with	27.876354379996755
i am going to prove to you that i have not	13.869597718514107
good thought the gascon this is a promising beginning	78.05593536119879
monsieur dartagnan he resumed do you wish to become a captain	41.49851740809327
yes my lord	5.889624051052218
and your friend still longs to be made a baron	65.3809294635364
at this very moment my lord he no doubt dreams that he is one already	70.44110387550062
then said mazarin taking from his portfolio the letter which he had already show	37.85006358913788
dartagnan looked at the envelope there was no address on it	55.47270373288481
am i not to know to whom to present it	46.96943541508486
you will know when you reach london at london you may tear off the outer envelop	62.241143642804694
and what are my instructions	52.6377856051283
to obey in every particular the man to whom this letter is addressed	85.16569183741971
you must set out for boulogne	41.36355538585441
at the royal arms of england you will find a young gentleman named mordaunt	30.363700234732445
yes my lord and what am i to do with this young gentleman	21.597915132894915
follow wherever he leads you	499.25078246783625
dartagnan looked at the cardinal with a stupefied air	17.32162381057209
there are your instructions said mazarin go	38.792048278399626
go tis easy to say so but that requires money and i have nt any	99.09144492337495
ah replied mazarin so you have no money	31.915304237241376
none my lord	18.91462976366644
but the diamond i gave you yesterday	176.00756575415778
i wish to keep it in remembrance of your eminence	40.480541411861594
mazarin sighed	676.5484157598127
tis very dear living in england my lord especially as envoy extraordinary	451.05334633557595
zounds replied mazarin the people there are very sedate and their habits since t	62.74893210379276
he opened a drawer and took out a purse	49.11521446764474
what do you say to a thousand crowns	18.772062155747747
dartagnan pouted out his lower lip in a most extraordinary manner	114.99896344220811
i reply my lord tis but little as certainly i shall not go alone	103.8311971005706
i suppose not	95.73792528238167
monsieur du vallon that worthy gentleman for with the exception of yourself mons	53.198261982835156
then my lord replied dartagnan pointing to the purse which mazarin still held if	58.84395931859528
be it so on his account i add two hundred crowns	58.34806972220693
scoundrel muttered dartagnan	29.258751966571385
but on our return he said aloud may we that is my friend and i depend on having 	74.002303561108
on the honor of mazarin	5.0361600942528515
i should like another sort of oath better said dartagnan to himself then aloud m	133.40475726397221
her majesty is asleep and you must set off directly replied mazarin go pray sir	115.34599329039088

i offer my best respects and services to you my lord	82.405885186963
dartagnan then returning to the officer said	93.0378306156361

the officer went off with an eagerness that showed the gascon that he had some p	32.76085794630998
porthos was snoring most musically when some one touched him on the shoulder	129.5198180111844
i come from the cardinal said the officer	37.34643986697364
heigho said porthos opening his large eyes what have you got to say	58.32740124562004
that his eminence has ordered you to england and that monsieur dartagnan is wait	71.48375455361658
porthos sighed heavily arose took his hat his pistols and his cloak and departed	203.88524986098332
no sooner had he turned his back than the officer laid himself down in it and he	82.88307483660871
it was very natural he being the only person in the whole assemblage except the 	59.22219836216127
chapter liv	2.820124948157892
in which we hear tidings of aramis	37.96478072509878
dartagnan went straight to the stables day was just dawning	107.32533081823783
he found his horse and that of porthos fastened to the manger but to an empty ma	108.01885690286416
he took pity on these poor animals and went to a corner of the stable where he s	81.69273449298817
it was mousqueton who having no straw to lie upon had helped himself to that of 	98.29073059901174
mousqueton cried dartagnan let us be off let us set off	26.411472119101926
mousqueton recognizing the voice of his masters friend got up suddenly and in do	152.78231195350497
ho ho exclaimed dartagnan picking up a louis and displaying it heres a louis tha	37.69609158013404
mousqueton blushed so confusedly that the gascon began to laugh at him and said	47.08945602249851
porthos would be angry my dear monsieur mousqueton but i pardon you only let us 	58.45511759626279
mousqueton instantly assumed a jovial countenance saddled the horses quickly and	414.86894892265667
whilst this went on porthos arrived with a very cross look on his face and was a	64.53977030456326
ah that s it he cried you have your promotion and i my barony	62.70182418508491
we are going to fetch our brevets said dartagnan and when we come back master ma	52.564332571438605
and where are we going asked porthos	16.03769169535917
to paris first i have affairs to settle	140.2839863995303
and they both set out for paris	46.562445463010015
on arriving at its gates they were astounded to see the threatening aspect of th	52.80628514226427
around a brokendown carriage the people were uttering imprecations whilst the pe	130.26343344738092
on the other hand as the two friends approached to enter they showed them every 	57.48218352586107
what is the king doing they asked	30.513516118047818
he is asleep	94.874918412008
and the spanish woman	90.6485945314513
and the cursed italian	185.69186660439365
he is awake so keep on the watch as they are gone away its for some purpose rely	211.8986699830767
but as you are the strongest after all continued dartagnan do nt be furious with	71.23559629499333
the people listened to these words and let go the ladies who thanked dartagnan w	80.35915949349724
now onward cried the gascon	203.10916463165495
and they continued their way crossing the barricades getting the chains about th	233.82537707592752
in the place of the palais royal dartagnan saw a sergeant who was drilling six o	25.39598288118342
it was planchet who brought into play profitably the recollections of the regime	40.88297122789442
in passing before dartagnan he recognized his former master	117.29446151654652
goodday monsieur dartagnan said planchet proudly	26.099587208664683
goodday monsieur dulaurier replied dartagnan	16.971898430601456
planchet stopped short staring at dartagnan	116.26391228305827
the first row seeing their sergeant stop stopped in their turn and so on to the 	225.06354613855655
these citizens are dreadfully ridiculous observed dartagnan to porthos and went 	91.82167186360034
five minutes afterward he entered the hotel of la chevrette where pretty madelei	25.95390669935287
my dear mistress turquaine said the gascon if you happen to have any money lock 	61.38696483930352
why prithee asked madeleine	91.21856657108641
because paris is going to be reduced to dust and ashes like babylon of which you	63.96339011259972
and are you going to leave me at such a time	20.664245805983356
this very instant	724.8209257622055
and where are you going	9.690590443817737
ah if you could tell me that you would be doing me a service	36.39733417087478
ah me ah me	10994.149655418867
have you any letters for me inquired dartagnan wishing to signify to the hostess	42.401765419637584
there s one just arrived and she handed the letter to dartagnan	66.4978609335184
from athos cried dartagnan recognizing the handwriting	57.73220826128179
ah said porthos let us hear what he says	15.789121855690295
dartagnan opened the letter and read as follows	40.16698452558473
dear dartagnan dear du vallon my good friends perhaps this may be the last time 	46.39358997351653
aramis and i are very unhappy but god our courage and the remembrance of our fri	92.51510082832836
think often of raoul	247.6255165651716
i intrust to you certain papers which are at blois and in two months and a half 	98.31116746463879
embrace with all your heart the vicomte for your devoted friend	152.97286655640133
i believe by heaven said dartagnan that i shall embrace him since he s upon our 	78.11387112545087
and i said porthos shall make him my sole heir	46.544220610479044
let us see what more does athos say	64.13386857000653
should you meet on your journey a certain monsieur mordaunt distrust him in a le	76.93822261796782
monsieur mordaunt exclaimed the gascon surprised	31.474629075285492
monsieur mordaunt tis well said porthos we shall remember that but see there is 	42.27438700816723
so there is said dartagnan and he read	33.80506255164506
we conceal the place where we are dear friends knowing your brotherly affection 	245.4663817184719
confound it interrupted porthos with an explosion of passion which sent mousquet	63.84165811290266
dartagnan continued	174.78990488288852
athos bequeaths to you raoul and i bequeath to you my revenge	50.652966953919424
if by any good luck you lay your hand on a certain man named mordaunt tell porth	78.68606837692285
i dare not say more in a letter	99.5668347250595
if that is all it is easily done said porthos	40.19843666452086
on the contrary observed dartagnan with a vexed look it would be impossible	41.91322565326028
how so	18.12257473970411
it is precisely this monsieur mordaunt whom we are going to join at boulogne and	35.00148875317425
well suppose instead of joining this monsieur mordaunt we were to go and join ou	80.61295791400812
i did think of it but this letter has neither date nor postmark	134.34147816665276

and he began to wander about the room like a man beside himself gesticulating an	76.21927240121869
as to dartagnan he remained standing like a man in consternation with the deepes	24.28234924057689
ah this is not right athos insults us he wishes to die alone it is bad bad bad	93.42196988084241
mousqueton witnessing this despair melted into tears in a corner of the room	140.1091044094687
come said dartagnan all this leads to nothing	82.56321193018842
let us go on	5.261410145523138

they set out	23.54472796640469
on arriving at the rue saint denis the friends found a vast concourse of people	31.935870923551896
it was the duc de beaufort who was coming from the vendomois and whom the coadju	14.362362953328962
with the dukes aid they already considered themselves invincible	379.00615766490756
the two friends turned off into a side street to avoid meeting the prince and so	85.9740318751081

once across the barriers these two knew neither fatigue nor fear	515.3446260065897
their horses flew and they never ceased speaking of athos and aramis	58.68314893066991
the camp had entered saint omer the friends made a little detour and went to the	93.43359738876612

and as soon as he saw the two cavaliers he ran to them with open arms	39.92958694720938
oh is it you dear friends did you come here to fetch me will you take me away wi	59.940780681213724

in fact tears rolled down his cheeks	297.5992706923648
porthos turned aside in order not to show by his honest round face what was pass	242.98241227764905
deuce take it cried dartagnan more moved than he had been for a long time do nt 	38.66052337906784

all gascon as he was dartagnan could not bear alone the weight of that falsehood	87.75675538625346

eh give it to me said the young man	15.090545362469793

can i have lost it ah confound it yes my pocket has a hole in it	110.36484148882326
oh yes monsieur raoul said mousqueton the letter was very consoling	29.654358069426067
these gentlemen read it to me and i wept for joy	70.16156188595755
but at any rate you know where he is monsieur dartagnan asked raoul somewhat com	31.94035594628326
ah that s the thing replied the gascon	13.817455628709544
undoubtedly i know it but it is a mystery	23.886771772311526
not to me i hope	41.26854721782311
no not to you so i am going to tell you where he is	20.445574959530212
porthos devoured dartagnan with wondering eyes	446.97634953624157
where the devil shall i say that he is so that he can not try to rejoin him thou	43.92129040392792
well where is he sir asked raoul in a soft and coaxing voice	31.827629916248902
he is at constantinople	16.290586493204472
among the turks exclaimed raoul alarmed	63.02024236776842
good heavens how can you tell me that	24.44480136277887
does that alarm you cried dartagnan	52.75391155386924
pooh what are the turks to such men as the comte de la fere and the abb dherblay	23.811141892125192
ah his friend is with him said raoul	40.14344267754081
that comforts me a little	109.76804998861832
has he wit or notthis demon dartagnan said porthos astonished at his friends dec	88.49950339239679
now sir said dartagnan wishing to change the conversation here are fifty pistole	94.649168944962
i suppose you have no more money and that they will be welcome	39.223329400294666
i have still twenty pistoles sir	141.6723447645506
well take them that makes seventy	379.50094181260374
and if you wish for more said porthos putting his hand to his pocket	20.69941814254196
thank you sir replied raoul blushing thank you a thousand times	23.679561526889213
at this moment olivain appeared	8.756342956074613
apropos said dartagnan loud enough for the servant to hear him are you satisfied	66.70091543704689
yes in some respects tolerably well	631.2195680809318
olivain pretended to have heard nothing and entered the tent	92.61388208606323
what fault do you find with the fellow	143.85917605499185
he is a glutton	38.07422609844183
oh sir cried olivain reappearing at this accusation	57.115057571063716
and a little bit of a thief	95.94833520708978
oh sir oh	98.70879522834306
and more especially a notorious coward	303.9750568466368
oh oh sir you really vilify me cried olivain	40.62428208355034
the deuce cried dartagnan	45.413232522462316
pray learn monsieur olivain that people like us are not to be served by cowards	117.03645929376258
rob your master eat his sweetmeats and drink his wine but by jove do nt be a cow	96.0768004900975
look at monsieur mouston see the honorable wounds he has received observe how hi	263.76371722239145
mousqueton was in the third heaven and would have embraced dartagnan had he dare	127.60346144616204
send away that fellow raoul said the gascon for if he s a coward he will disgrac	52.57047376376106
monsieur says i am coward cried olivain because he wanted the other day to fight	142.8714869808929
monsieur olivain a lackey ought never to disobey said dartagnan sternly then tak	96.68712735424862
remember that	28.190544920281305
olivain bowed and slipped the crown into his pocket	38.30789875962988
and now raoul said the gascon monsieur du vallon and i are going away as ambassa	32.422983247832505
and having meantime embraced his ward he passed him into the robust arms of port	160.93450275735532
come said dartagnan let us go	6.1425928399571745
and they set out for boulogne where toward evening they arrived their horses fle	77.90745741605693
at ten steps from the place where they halted was a young man in black who seeme	50.584731811433166
dartagnan approached him and seeing him stare so fixedly said	104.03195827109579
well friend i do nt like people to quiz me	115.45445172440968
sir said the young man do you not come from paris if you please	10.953521713066387
dartagnan thought it was some gossip who wanted news from the capital	111.95160641650357
yes sir he said in a softened tone	19.454415909196765
are you not going to put up at the arms of england	16.368229116704935
yes sir	25.133399679592255
are you not charged with a mission from his eminence cardinal mazarin	42.26480296641425
yes sir	24.85108944072343
in that case i am the man you have to do with	21.783227213203215
i am m	59.58334672768554
ah thought dartagnan the man i am warned against by athos	85.1275268348658
ah thought porthos the man aramis wants me to strangle	76.64981768031717
they both looked searchingly at the young man who misunderstood the meaning of t	28.895568102805207
do you doubt my word he said	21.81777074793762
in that case i can give you proofs	35.39008728708629
no sir said dartagnan and we place ourselves at your orders	68.50346754499462
well gentlemen resumed mordaunt we must set out without delay today is the last 	82.6104684979302
my ship is ready and had you not come i must have set off without you for genera	69.17941836014467
so thought the lieutenant tis to general cromwell that our dispatches are addres	97.87504332671718
have you no letter for him asked the young man	14.386524245289644
i have one the seal of which i am not to break till i reach london but since you	55.496991476113536
dartagnan tore open the envelope of the letter	76.95517388065522
it was directed to monsieur oliver cromwell general of the army of the english n	24.464735742607296
ah said dartagnan a singular commission	50.37917206520279
who is this monsieur oliver cromwell inquired porthos	19.36477928836692
formerly a brewer replied the gascon	74.53002387656645
perhaps mazarin wishes to make a speculation in beer as we did in straw said por	74.9300865932266
come come gentlemen said mordaunt impatiently let us depart	36.92782739876405
what exclaimed porthos without supper can not monsieur cromwell wait a little	209.57153079927636
yes but i said mordaunt	14.273788085910649
well you said porthos what then	46.08259251731536
i can not wait	29.268184809044833
oh as to you that is not my concern and i shall sup either with or without your 	102.64717150625566
the young mans eyes kindled in secret but he restrained himself	54.44652817800779
monsieur said dartagnan you must excuse famished travelers	165.02535499363168
besides our supper ca nt delay you much	253.38853705572652
we will hasten on to the inn you will meanwhile proceed on foot to the harbor	116.31448360399881
we will take a bite and shall be there as soon as you are	29.753321108458795
just as you please gentlemen provided we set sail he said	139.46507837417292
the name of your ship inquired dartagnan	54.1503300537312
the standard	7100.56373105876
very well in half an hour we shall be on board	20.63898707911395
and the friends spurring on their horses rode to the hotel the arms of england	38.68761354909403
what do you say of that young man asked dartagnan as they hurried along	31.019457173588652
i say that he does nt suit me at all said porthos and that i feel a strong itchi	31.33906696681504
by no means my dear porthos that man is a messenger of general cromwell it would	31.850547235608854
nevertheless said porthos i have always noticed that aramis gives good advice	60.85847127210094
listen returned dartagnan when our embassy is finished	180.78707985687996
if it brings us back to france	41.883367540155554
well we shall see	17.418331792120266
at that moment the two friends reached the hotel arms of england where they supp	23.64687322873904
there they found a brig ready to set sail upon the deck of which they recognized	60.36635534912273
it is singular said dartagnan whilst the boat was taking them to the standard it	60.554787076332424
a few minutes later they were on board but the embarkation of the horses was a l	20.01562319346137
the young man stamped impatiently and ordered all sail to be spread	141.6843700004891
porthos completely used up by three nights without sleep and a journey of sevent	163.8742162134546
dartagnan overcoming his repugnance to mordaunt walked with him upon the deck an	72.53281067631119

it was midnight	126.41745882558186
some highlanders were listlessly keeping watch	747.4146093690493
the moon which was partially obscured by heavy clouds now and then lit up the mu	61.14915595111355

in the shadow of a tent the former was awaiting him	68.35480734888523

well my friend there is not a moment to lose we must let the king know immediate	64.96019639937732

we must go and find lord winter	59.282463527017974
they both set off to the other end of the camp but as it did not cover more than	26.915207708689973

however you may look and see added the lackey raising the curtained entrance of 	120.70980030484407
lord winter was seated near an aperture arranged as a window to let in the night	128.05860887044332
the two friends approached winter who with his head on his hands was gazing at t	76.88398166864451
he turned around recognized athos and aramis and held out his hand to them	40.624901965630784
have you observed said he to them what a bloodred color the moon has tonight	160.48780899147877
no replied athos i thought it looked much the same as usual	51.75765292248218
look again chevalier returned lord winter	379.7630625922851
i must own said aramis i am like the comte de la ferei can see nothing remarkabl	32.50322178381984
my lord said athos in a position so precarious as ours we must examine the earth	62.94158951027082
have you studied our scotch troops and have you confidence in them	94.4434093751185
the scotch inquired winter	662.6066248214306

not the least in the world said aramis and athos at once	23.00107518980241
tell me continued winter always possessed by the same idea is there not a tradit	100.4311834954029
the evening before the day he was assassinated when he was playing at chess with	47.259830109935194
de bassompiere saw clots of blood upon the chessboard	96.28914894746447
yes said athos and the marechal has often told me so himself	82.58534038960582
then it was so murmured winter and the next day henry iv	44.60966351116862
was killed	5407.957889862797
but what has this vision of henry iv	20.741888930565064
to do with you my lord inquired aramis	18.19485355698732
nothing and indeed i am mad to trouble you with such things when your coming to 	92.38483387184664
yes my lord said athos i wish to speak to the king	8.867729809352845
to the king but the king is asleep	32.731291806818646
i have something important to reveal to him	117.8361074102231
can it not be put off till tomorrow	46.53717454445587
he must know it this moment and perhaps it is already too late	80.13420206202024
come then said lord winter	43.90024742663524
lord winters tent was pitched by the side of the royal marquee a kind of corrido	34.93471737648079
this corridor was guarded not by a sentinel but by a confidential servant throug	109.04166124164976
these gentlemen are with me said winter	63.31651227111422
the lackey bowed and let them pass	96.35822873844319
as he had said on a camp bed dressed in his black doublet booted unbelted with h	67.48645675651746
they advanced and athos who was the first to enter gazed a moment in silence on 	69.20640724886447
athos sighed deeply the sigh woke the king so lightly did he sleep	210.66502603227713
he opened his eyes	22.44431814288783
ah said he raising himself on his elbow is it you comte de la fere	31.44465682632058
yes sire replied athos	11.518220226194963

for unpaid wages yes i know it	124.68081937137829
for the last year my faithful highlanders have fought for honor alone	154.82153161236045
athos smiled	83.6416670209376

i heard it with my own ears	49.98080217227389
the king sighed deeply as if his heart would break and then buried his face in h	55.11594137947889

lying behind the tent of lord leven i raised it and saw all heard all	98.82644119827079

the king raised himself buckled on his belt and passing his handkerchief over hi	71.15747929773491
well what is to be done	14.029585585559015
sire have you in the army one regiment on which you can implicitly rely	119.97128543992278
winter said the king do you believe in the fidelity of yours	29.339629703636767
sire they are but men and men are become both weak and wicked	110.61478209571453

winter then left the tent in the meantime the king finished his toilet	72.02448634268046
the first rays of daybreak penetrated the aperture of the tent as winter reenter	150.12945787727585
all is ready sire said he	47.13327292741736
for us also inquired athos	86.99165602254602
grimaud and blaisois are holding your horses ready saddled	67.4516469227662
in that case exclaimed athos let us not lose an instant but set off	30.34667100893124
come added the king	46.732428047591455
sire said aramis will not your majesty acquaint some of your friends of this	47.00937463237206
friends answered charles sadly i have but threeone of twenty years who has never	55.733570978061685
come gentlemen come	161.9518950376732
the king quitted his tent and found his horse ready waiting for him	78.02441641165328
it was a chestnut that the king had ridden for three years and of which he was v	25.927368025662563
the horse neighed with pleasure at seeing him	238.30020543389702
ah said the king i was unjust here is a creature that loves me	53.780757362004415
you at least will be faithful to me arthur	57.57827973373827
the horse as if it understood these words bent its red nostrils toward the kings	198.4161612859376
yes yes said the king caressing it with his hand yes my arthur thou art a fond a	65.21351052605817
after this little scene charles threw himself into the saddle and turning to ath	43.884780465980654
now gentlemen i am at your service	19.47891687963914
but athos was standing with his eyes fixed on a black line which bordered the ba	29.16802575848784
what is that line cried athos whose vision was still rather obscured by the unce	48.39345079960346
what is that line i did not observe it yesterday	78.22718592814952
it must be the fog rising from the river said the king	45.82161426856405
sire it is something more opaque than the fog	64.61576761682339
indeed said winter it appears to me like a bar of red color	77.08312581563932
it is the enemy who have made a sortie from newcastle and are surrounding us exc	39.37385045823206
the enemy cried the king	75.4032027210867
yes the enemy	199.8959943554999
it is too late	12.148002175388983
stop a moment does not that sunbeam yonder just by the side of the town glitter 	86.92995440400396
this was the name given the cuirassiers whom cromwell had made his bodyguard	50.0333332048301
ah said the king we shall soon see whether my highlanders have betrayed me or no	45.09864473068676
what are you going to do exclaimed athos	8.693024178488267
to give them the order to charge and run down these miserable rebels	257.68128201315443
and the king putting spurs to his horse set off to the tent of lord leven	61.32514512704053
follow him said athos	7.640046083446972
come exclaimed aramis	25.61018836594084
is the king wounded cried lord winter	176.37765249934805
i see spots of blood on the ground	80.62475962871387
and he set off to follow the two friends	30.875312396258185
he was stopped by athos	29.458380578128562
go and call out your regiment said he i can foresee that we shall have need of i	61.97179861222084
winter turned his horse and the two friends rode on	39.08927978716827
it had taken but two minutes for the king to reach the tent of the scottish comm	33.479758374831256
the general was there surrounded by the more prominent chiefs	134.1088893053571
the king they exclaimed as all rose in bewilderment	334.571614943186
charles was indeed in the midst of them his hat on his head his brows bent strik	35.91488106174593
yes gentlemen the king in person the king who has come to ask for some account o	42.69329619660298
what is the matter sire exclaimed lord leven	26.697526812973276
it is this sir said the king angrily that general cromwell has reached newcastle	69.74826858215656
of this treaty at least i have been warned	52.22568963771824
this is the matter gentlemen answer and exculpate yourselves for i stand here to	161.94455885910463
sire said lord leven with hesitation sire your majesty has been deceived by fals	22.709534378557084
my own eyes have seen the enemy extend itself between myself and scotland and i 	108.40275255887691
the scotch chieftains looked at each other in their turn with frowning brows	72.15576538902494
sire murmured lord leven crushed by shame sire we are ready to give you every pr	69.5652212397153
i ask but one said the king put the army in battle array and face the enemy	132.31446857415943
that can not be sire said the earl	43.57726877266621
how can not be what hinders it exclaimed the king	41.69203909743435
your majesty is well aware that there is a truce between us and the english army	23.529946647637814
and if there is a truce the english army has broken it by quitting the town cont	44.753531111218535
now i tell you you must pass with me through this army across to scotland and if	59.2320829576426
the eyes of the scotch flashed fire and as often happens on such occasions from 	109.96607921671577
yes said they we have promised to deliver scotland and england from him who for 	58.301374392968064
we have promised and we will keep our promise	40.32811637593845
charles stuart you are our prisoner	109.38072751601906
and both extended their hands as if to seize the king but before they could touc	62.987135533535124
aramis had passed his sword through the body of the first and athos had knocked 	36.955262917953675
then as lord leven and the other chieftains recoiled before this unexpected resc	105.3394442945106
on their road they perceived lord winter marching at the head of his regiment	75.5972496930005
the king motioned him to accompany them	82.60101502102408
chapter lvi	2.7354935960416715
the avenger	1807.0133101234849
they all four entered the tent they had no plan readythey must think of one	226.2858861662504
the king threw himself into an armchair	38.37065030575273
i am lost said he	51.3892274538839
no sire replied athos	11.597617668301467
you are only betrayed	146.6557686685592
the king sighed deeply	90.47844941482658
betrayed yes betrayed by the scotch amongst whom i was born whom i have always l	150.83128867590528
oh traitors that ye are	492.8591561443598
sire said athos this is not a moment for recrimination but a time to show yourse	28.019101035714247
up sire up for you have here at least three men who will not betray you	87.94207608360163
ah if we had been five murmured athos thinking of dartagnan and porthos	46.4400476907422
what do you say inquired charles rising	12.184245519946858
i say sire that there is now but one way open	139.6242422265075
lord winter answers for his regiment or at least very nearly sowe will not split	87.63619717144864
there is another method said aramis	43.26095680702958
let one of us put on the dress and mount the kings horse	105.60534407321427
whilst they pursue him the king might escape	179.2731256081622
it is good advice said athos and if the king will do one of us the honor we shal	29.965224533806197
what do you think of this counsel winter asked the king looking with admiration 	40.711410037298485
i think the only chance of saving your majesty has just been proposed by monsieu	45.559105099247475
i humbly entreat your majesty to choose quickly for we have not an instant to lo	109.29428572423012
but if i accept it is death or at least imprisonment for him who takes my place	69.99812101511338
he will have had the glory of having saved his king cried winter	109.74319059863771
the king looked at his old friend with tears in his eyes undid the order of the 	26.80269533758463
it is right said athos he has served your majesty longer than we have	53.0748937761064
the king overheard these words and turned around with tears in his eyes	43.18518281665369
wait a moment sir said he i have an order for each of you also	41.15709208048311
he turned to a closet where his own orders were locked up and took out two ribbo	62.31963439902793
these can not be for us said athos	23.463567841659533
why not sir asked charles	34.8506781979539
such are for royalty and we are simple commoners	254.088717349696
speak not of crowns	1393.020484672326
i shall not find amongst them such great hearts as yours	167.74086376557506
no no you do yourselves injustice but i am here to do you justice	55.694730643557314
on your knees count	274.1171120646168
athos knelt down and the king passed the ribbon down from left to right as usual	194.06066834194596
be brave faithful and loyal he said you are brave faithful and loyal	136.16773900122573
i knight you monsieur le comte	100.47644910075502
then turning to aramis he said	10.335177913754043
it is now your turn monsieur le chevalier	66.26603182378607
the same ceremony recommenced with the same words whilst winter unlaced his leat	182.7337588550489
charles having proceeded with aramis as with athos embraced them both	163.2907603099158
sire said winter who in this trying emergency felt all his strength and energy f	150.19275439362673
the king looked at the three gentlemen	33.713933057443164
then we must fly said he	44.8819265401734
flying through an army sire said athos in all countries in the world is called c	82.235328685008
then i shall die sword in hand said charles	65.18472177799612
monsieur le comte monsieur le chevalier if ever i am king	78.97957402501714
sire you have already done us more honor than simple gentlemen could ever aspire	415.7569449021995
but we must not lose time	48.3265772404575
we have already wasted too much	55.01823526095093
the king again shook hands with all three exchanged hats with winter and went ou	168.47609350011896
winters regiment was ranged on some high ground above the camp	217.67938343292536
the king followed by the three friends turned his steps that way	98.89031501269764
the scotch camp seemed as if at last awakened the soldiers had come out of their	66.18111896585337
do you see that said the king	11.167329173989415
perhaps they are penitent and preparing to march	92.77954828290399
if they are penitent said athos let them follow us	34.137393328858714
well said the king what shall we do	14.460634724073499
let us examine the enemys army	78.99825579038827
at the same instant the eyes of the little group were fixed on the same line whi	17.440368304255074
the air was soft and clear as it generally is at that early hour of the morning	87.70074190204065
the regiments the standards and even the colors of the horses and uniforms were 	102.23221636230102
on the summit of a rising ground a little in advance of the enemy appeared a sho	60.53752242393944
he turned a spyglass toward the little group amongst which the king stood	81.56109779208862
does this man know your majesty personally inquired aramis	72.36070604088145
charles smiled	87.54806842131063
that man is cromwell said he	27.938645980274764
then draw down your hat sire that he may not discover the substitution	159.4806027929484
ah said athos how much time we have lost	30.95766188502273
now said the king give the word and let us start	32.39005369150242
will you not give it sire asked athos	30.725478233870117
no i make you my lieutenantgeneral said the king	39.34639233632727
listen then lord winter	104.55826864028745
proceed sire i beg	109.5820291269049
what we are going to say does not concern your majesty	34.89416994931107
the king smiling turned a few steps back	100.79873450921893
this is what i propose to do said athos	16.7381311457908
we will divide our regiments into two squadrons	114.65757010688111
you will put yourself at the head of the first	23.526900627602696
we and his majesty will lead the second	182.08211376427928
if no obstacle occurs we will both charge together force the enemys line and thr	230.21089835817304
once arrived at the brink of the river should we even find them three ranks deep	123.88267939489387
to horse said lord winter	90.37151680718465
to horse reechoed athos everything is arranged and decided	419.58039074164446
now gentlemen cried the king forward and rally to the old cry of france montjoy 	61.52663186147171
denis the war cry of england is too often in the mouths of traitors	96.84266896566368
they mountedthe king on winters horse and winter on that of the king then winter	192.93795857135675
the scotch army stood motionless and silent seized with shame at sight of these 	76.2047361150502
some of the chieftains left the ranks and broke their swords in two	43.50206087328423
there said the king that consoles me they are not all traitors	70.77523041623817
at this moment winters voice was raised with the cry of forward	53.75030012931849
the first squadron moved off the second followed and descended from the plateau	124.39535874096943
a regiment of cuirassiers nearly equal as to numbers issued from behind the hill	159.9545416025717
the king pointed this out	538.673795052989
sire said athos we foresaw this and if lord winters men but do their duty we are	103.17779122085642
at this moment they heard above all the galloping and neighing of the horses win	67.94998599633031
sword in hand	82.05972518892263
at these words every sword was drawn and glittered in the air like lightning	80.1484560196034
now gentlemen said the king in his turn excited by this sight come gentlemen swo	70.21785684446492
but aramis and athos were the only ones to obey this command and the kings examp	43.956132930208014
we are betrayed said the king in a low voice	14.079570498352158
wait a moment said athos perhaps they do not recognize your majestys voice and a	61.91895538829953
have they not heard that of their colonel but look look cried the king drawing u	131.57294652704246
ah cowards traitors screamed lord winter whose voice they heard whilst his men q	592.5632321218637
about fifteen men were ranged around him and awaited the charge of cromwells cui	51.68820076064499
let us go and die with them said the king	15.119074593797311
let us go said athos and aramis	6.039487881632876
all faithful hearts with me cried out winter	483.788245033735
this voice was heard by the two friends who set off full gallop	27.033483445186967
no quarter cried a voice in french answering to that of winter which made them t	127.85927101974973
as for winter at the sound of that voice he turned pale and was as it were petri	39.37004872150256
it was the voice of a cavalier mounted on a magnificent black horse who was char	44.68786235623781
tis he murmured winter his eyes glazed and he allowed his sword to fall to his s	61.831415884648
the king the king cried out several voices deceived by the blue ribbon and chest	152.14248251399314
no it is not the king exclaimed the cavalier	24.33424256992877
lord winter you are not the king you are my uncle	24.633111871637297
at the same moment mordaunt for it was he leveled his pistol at winter it went o	52.0125067111506
think of my mother shouted mordaunt as his horse plunged and darted off at full 	109.71111722252178
wretch exclaimed aramis raising his pistol as he passed by him but the powder fl	45.97662458940935
at this moment the whole regiment came up and they fell upon the few men who had	28.080673875952947
athos after making sure that lord winter was really dead let fall the corpse and	304.0340558386236
come aramis now for the honor of france and the two englishmen who were nearest 	58.716569316936884
at the same moment a fearful hurrah rent the air and thirty blades glittered abo	66.27092971126122
suddenly a man sprang out of the english ranks fell upon athos twined arms of st	72.851530271613

a giant had seized also aramiss two wrists who struggled in vain to release hims	116.0650566934427
dart exclaimed athos whilst the gascon covered his mouth with his hand	41.63240109152588
i am your prisoner said aramis giving up his sword to porthos	24.331887179301056
fire fire cried mordaunt returning to the group surrounding the two friends	50.289587227081405
and wherefore fire said the colonel every one has yielded	285.1440903612501
it is the son of milady said athos to dartagnan	9.615645339209852
i recognize him	191.5864505508028
it is the monk whispered porthos to aramis	32.85686808226172
i know it	14.416461648918071
and now the ranks began to open	89.18200343954518
dartagnan held the bridle of athoss horse and porthos that of aramis	35.14224248049904
both of them attempted to lead his prisoner off the battlefield	117.97638147962381
this movement revealed the spot where winters body had fallen	162.69983895287623
mordaunt had found it out and was gazing on his dead relative with an expression	69.29893557128656
athos though now cool and collected put his hand to his belt where his loaded pi	92.5104247949002
what are you about said dartagnan	11.919828770718
let me kill him	27.227892179782753
we are all four lost if by the least gesture you discover that you recognize him	156.2921941813043
then turning to the young man he exclaimed	13.637231977030257
a fine prize a fine prize friend mordaunt we have both myself and monsieur du va	94.74376823256488
but said mordaunt looking at athos and aramis with bloodshot eyes these are fren	46.06120589723589
ifaith i do nt know	8.087586556874736
are you french sir said he to athos	10.009720598294882
i am replied the latter gravely	81.6836586845653
very well my dear sir you are the prisoner of a fellow countryman	21.999870305826732
but the kingwhere is the king exclaimed athos anxiously	55.8107474441471
dartagnan vigorously seized his prisoners hand saying	769.0125346341025
eh the king we have secured him	75.72792683350717
yes said aramis through an infamous act of treason	74.0160667895889
porthos pressed his friends hand and said to him	48.71608272391721
yes sir all is fair in war stratagem as well as force look yonder	213.69843721314743
at this instant the squadron that ought to have protected charless retreat was a	73.92679254253383
the king who was entirely surrounded walked alone in a great empty space	153.16438916759463
he appeared calm but it was evidently not without a mighty effort	154.29002261062814
drops of perspiration trickled down his face and from time to time he put a hand	58.92162167922034
behold nebuchadnezzar exclaimed an old puritan soldier whose eyes flashed at the	42.881499873214686
do you call him nebuchadnezzar said mordaunt with a terrible smile no it is char	16.608836192728003
charles glanced a moment at the insolent creature who uttered this but did not r	52.92372916493388
nevertheless the calm religious dignity of his countenance abashed mordaunt	172.56212434639082
bon jour messieurs said the king to the two gentlemen who were held by dartagnan	28.82345211691942
the day has been unfortunate but it is not your fault thank god but where is my 	65.62217732085881
the two gentlemen turned away their heads in silence	49.556059488664744
in straffords company said mordaunt tauntingly	125.57262942253848
charles shuddered	354.693306401848
the demon had known how to wound him	443.69530327518714
the remembrance of strafford was a source of lasting remorse to him the shadow t	43.24608626416001
the king looked around him	17.25700182763584
he saw a corpse at his feet	38.190096101969374
it was winters	8.610201009867106
he uttered not a word nor shed a tear but a deadly pallor spread over his face h	78.70723275158463
lord winter is killed then inquired dartagnan fixing his eyes on the corpse	43.32997264752884
yes said athos by his own nephew	28.450012056927765
come he was the first of us to go peace be to him he was an honest man said dart	69.94937317024201
charles stuart said the colonel of the english regiment approaching the king who	58.03930828835451
colonel tomlison said charles kings can not yield the man alone submits to force	104.2133280140743
your sword	520.3374278879328
the king drew his sword and broke it on his knee	25.416165737539764
at this moment a horse without a rider covered with foam his nostrils extended a	43.818140290481054
the king smiled patted it with his hand and jumped lightly into the saddle	48.76545909670435
now gentlemen said he conduct me where you will	40.52987035083933
turning back again he said i thought i saw winter move if he still lives by all 	161.61523692839907
never fear king charles said mordaunt the bullet pierced his heart	120.94832958952493
do not breathe a word nor make the least sign to me or porthos said dartagnan to	46.797988240379404
the detachment now moved toward the town with the royal captive but on the road 	101.26927615160548
at the same time couriers started in every direction over england and europe to 	33.748747643943204
chapter lvii	2.5471234327312153
oliver cromwell	14.388479486505098
have you been to the general said mordaunt to dartagnan and porthos you know he 	19.510806369714693
we want first to put our prisoners in a place of safety replied dartagnan	78.95600213563038
do you know sir these gentlemen are each of them worth fifteen hundred pounds	50.87889127148507
oh be assured said mordaunt looking at them with an expression he vainly endeavo	33.735642719917564
i shall take better care of them myself answered dartagnan besides all they requ	92.48563694307197
i will go and see about that and then we shall have the honor of presenting ours	29.671069540713656
you think of starting at once then inquired mordaunt	90.07891943195811
our mission is ended and there is nothing more to detain us now but the good ple	67.46274422635732
the young man bit his lips and whispered to his sergeant	35.285909327499496
you will follow these men and not lose sight of them when you have discovered wh	79.23264219875665
the sergeant made a sign of comprehension	23.316718539017902
instead of following the knot of prisoners that were being taken into the town m	180.12554146450435
cromwell had given orders that no one was to be allowed admission but the sentin	46.12525258932327
mordaunt therefore raised the canvas and saw cromwell seated before a table his 	158.06960723437328
whether he heard mordaunt or not as he entered cromwell did not move	42.56316460904814
mordaunt remained standing near the door	45.81271148335191
at last after a few moments cromwell raised his head and as if he divined that s	27.700744590776864
i said i wished to be alone he exclaimed on seeing the young man	44.469173927892314
they thought this order did not concern me sir nevertheless if you wish it i am 	88.2318975465786
ah is it you mordaunt said cromwell the cloud passing away from his face since y	66.76111854849844
i come to congratulate you	38.60560835623673
to congratulate mewhat for	714.7929169819893
on the capture of charles stuart	12.18280765429534
you are now master of england	36.38612417900909
i was much more really so two hours ago	151.03554137980018
how so general	542.1789552825629
because england had need of me to take the tyrant and now the tyrant is taken	98.83982535440616
have you seen him	5.848410445844703
yes sir	24.650743025964463
said mordaunt	2.0563915030819633
what is his bearing	214.67819687895494
mordaunt hesitated but it seemed as though he was constrained to tell the truth	53.01403744797
calm and dignified said he	35.71356287214667
what did he say	15.327635049980628
some parting words to his friends	168.45392231647773
his friends murmured cromwell	39.271332306659836
has he any friends then he added aloud did he make any resistance	102.8593265671527
no sir with the exception of two or three friends every one deserted him he had 	103.48199344104889
to whom did he give up his sword	53.10432257665339
he did not give it up he broke it	52.48561345175844
he did well but instead of breaking it he might have used it to still more advan	87.12565932392081
there was a momentary pause	42.92382661111836
i heard that the colonel of the regiment that escorted charles was killed said c	165.76441104194828
yes sir	25.429167088483187
by whom inquired cromwell	50.98142416049431
by me	103.37132459077598
what was his name	22.95809980418639
lord winter	14.690864215324726
your uncle exclaimed cromwell	56.77333671800682
my uncle answered mordaunt but traitors to england are no longer members of my f	71.73722407189355
cromwell observed the young man a moment in silence then with that profound mela	38.592825708157875
mordaunt he said you are a terrible servant	33.16833764719909
when the lord commands said mordaunt his commands are not to be disputed	102.01109064162664
abraham raised the knife against isaac and isaac was his son	54.20155709311682
yes said cromwell but the lord did not suffer that sacrifice to be accomplished	55.96064447178278
i have looked around me said mordaunt and i have seen neither goat nor kid caugh	56.60617230270935
cromwell bowed	48.66224296545829
you are strong among the strong mordaunt he said and the frenchmen how did they 	72.11827199388543
most fearlessly	6132.871669000392
yes yes murmured cromwell the french fight well and if my glass was good and i m	68.81757347767535
they were replied mordaunt	56.65024027107611
after you however said cromwell	56.91485381743779
it was the fault of their horses not theirs	69.25582616428356
another pause	10253.735312028668
and the scotch	25.12262189841178
they kept their word and never stirred said mordaunt	176.65515955215088
wretched men	135.32793966840035
their officers wish to see you sir	154.8848122741859
i have no time to see them	25.352388916937297
are they paid	447.7410917308542
yes tonight	7292.417420676977
let them be off and return to their own country there to hide their shame if its	123.70564948200139
and now go mordaunt	107.72586879277317
before i go said mordaunt i have some questions and a favor to ask you sir	44.37008957388796
a favor from me	531.0752761885609
mordaunt bowed	70.50189247465508
i come to you my leader my head my father and i ask you master are you contented	78.69563667114706
cromwell looked at him with astonishment	7.87766547888879
the young man remained immovable	30.231618291640444
yes said cromwell you have done since i knew you not only your duty but more tha	36.393759092578065
do you remember sir it was my idea the scotch treaty for giving up the king	91.31605056450003
yes the idea was yours	142.05603330486795
i had no such contempt for men before	218.82634812501544
was i not a good ambassador in france	39.38067573131628
yes for mazarin has granted what i desire	128.30486859148448
have i not always fought for your glory and interests	64.59657509074162
too ardently perhaps it is what i have just reproached you for	64.26599385482758
but what is the meaning of all these questions	24.135732263475163
to tell you my lord that the moment has now arrived when with a single word you 	52.300913917685016
oh said oliver with a slight curl of his lip i forgot that every service merits 	51.845909624771316
sir i can take my pay at this moment to the full extent of my wishes	40.13645649744397
how is that	12.830627164871688
i have the payment under my hand i almost possess it	189.192216977125
what is it have they offered you money do you wish a step or some place in the g	79.0205968460173
sir will you grant me my request	98.968905750149
let us hear what it is first	29.228687643934308
sir when you have told me to obey an order did i ever answer let me see that ord	69.1066865983531
if however your wish should be one impossible to fulfill	235.8361182965327
when you have cherished a wish and have charged me with its fulfillment have i e	131.47235185435414
but a request preferred with so much preparation	524.8312499347124
ah do not fear sir said mordaunt with apparent simplicity it will not ruin you	36.90365875794253
well then said cromwell i promise as far as lies in my power to grant your reque	36.06068345169984
sir two prisoners were taken this morning will you let me have them	159.25725931964945
for their ransom have they then offered a large one inquired cromwell	218.62411757792768
on the contrary i think they are poor sir	29.957066892349363
they are friends of yours then	53.56646267106882
yes sir exclaimed mordaunt they are friends dear friends of mine and i would lay	56.758205689871936
very well mordaunt exclaimed cromwell pleased at having his opinion of the young	50.21490923388451
thank you sir exclaimed mordaunt thank you my life is always at your service and	20.386769587598547
he threw himself at the feet of cromwell and in spite of the efforts of the puri	14.110433412971766
what said cromwell arresting him for a moment as he arose is there nothing more 	85.43662620104857
you have given me all you can give me and from today your debt is paid	79.35862877572528
and mordaunt darted out of the generals tent his heart beating and his eyes spar	74.23556493762689
cromwell gazed a moment after him	107.17308585001649
he has slain his uncle he murmured	108.68856339998725
alas what are my servants possibly this one who asks nothing or seems to ask not	187.59401055915802
nobody serves me for nothing	185.96088324016128
charles who is my prisoner may still have friends but i have none	118.46699058040485
and with a deep sigh he again sank into the reverie that had been interrupted by	64.59943974465745
chapter lviii	2.6833810730514682
jesus seigneur	14.29748675972932
whilst mordaunt was making his way to cromwells tent dartagnan and porthos had b	38.80870884490025
the order given by mordaunt to the sergeant had been heard by dartagnan who acco	38.830782850826495
the prisoners therefore had remained silent as they marched along in company wit	164.85342779096
it would be impossible to describe mousquetons astonishment when from the thresh	37.26029440553214
he rubbed his eyes doubting if he really saw before him athos and aramis and for	89.03375604464463
mousqueton remained glued to the door awaiting the explanation of this strange o	62.56829011866692
what upset him completely was that the four friends seemed to have no acquaintan	92.9909054527042
the house to which dartagnan and porthos conducted athos and aramis was the one 	37.27914117242026
it was at the corner of two streets and had in the rear bordering on the side st	27.187712665475097
the windows on the ground floor according to a custom in provincial villages wer	60.90727274303153
the two friends made the prisoners enter the house first whilst they stood at th	67.02928566799332
why do nt we go in with them asked porthos	25.213241389287194
we must first see what the sergeant wishes us to do replied dartagnan	71.35267743750698
the sergeant and his men took possession of the little garden	122.42959440199202
dartagnan asked them what they wished and why they had taken that position	151.67953918943556
we have had orders answered the man to help you in taking care of your prisoners	100.75005684501718
there could be no fault to find with this arrangement on the contrary it seemed 	57.316266196629925
the sergeant answered that puritans never drank and put the crown piece in his p	140.68866727797578
ah said porthos what a fearful day my dear dartagnan	35.88717405232696
what a fearful day when today we find our friends	178.3077126162821
yes but under what circumstances	192.55258800133436
tis true that our position is an awkward one but let us go in and see more clear	66.92832971867027
things look black enough replied porthos i understand now why aramis advised me 	163.69981951910867
silence cried the gascon do not utter that name	49.4924524801327
but argued porthos i speak french and they are all english	79.2095613286837
dartagnan looked at porthos with that air of wonder which a cunning man can not 	43.39352183532844
but as porthos on his side could not comprehend his astonishment he merely pushe	67.04805001972721
they found athos in profound despondency aramis looked first at porthos and then	52.256653427807954
you want to know how we came here tis easily guessed	283.51389738670304
mazarin sent us with a letter to general cromwell	48.10137699069197
but how came you to fall into company with mordaunt whom i bade you distrust ask	161.8752290811183
and whom i advised you to strangle porthos said aramis	43.617464000259226
mazarin again	403.84125276096756
cromwell had sent him to mazarin	18.204373599235065
mazarin sent us to cromwell	58.608176301094275
there is a certain fatality in it	38.91707037509059
yes you are right dartagnan a fatality that will separate and ruin us so my dear	74.95206342695201
zounds on the contrary let us speak about it for it was agreed among us once for	63.496044431543055
yes added athos i now ask you dartagnan what side you are on ah behold for what 	125.88143852479485
do you know in what crime you are today engaged in the capture of a king his deg	48.33716707618133
oh oh cried porthos do you think so	13.353690944589312
you are exaggerating athos we are not so far gone as that replied the lieutenant	66.33020703470672
good heavens we are on the very eve of it	44.699327979172324
i say why is the king taken prisoner those who wish to respect him as a master w	187.75965892348927
do you think it is to replace him on the throne that cromwell has paid for him t	25.273872060835206
i do nt maintain the contrary said dartagnan	30.750739696949637
but what s that to us i am here because i am a soldier and have to obey ordersi 	43.8297171606234
that most sacred in the world said athos the cause of misfortune of religion roy	52.06122725255867
a friend a wife a daughter have done us the honor to call us to their aid	109.66273713085769
we have served them to the best of our poor means and god will recompense the wi	72.3387991440303
you may see matters differently dartagnan and think otherwise	288.78399253332117
i will not attempt to argue with you but i blame you	45.46228527407725
heyday cried dartagnan what matters it to me after all if cromwell who s an engl	59.264176899308715
i have nothing to do with these thingswhy hold me responsible	55.811173247982744
yes said porthos	3.9357143070622427
because all gentlemen are brothers because you are a gentleman because the kings	73.20805069074588
and you you dartagnan a man sprung from the ancient nobility of france bearing a	66.66841816068367
ah dartagnan perhaps you have done your duty as a soldier but as a gentleman i s	59.48614493952152
dartagnan was chewing the stalk of a flower unable to reply and thoroughly uncom	94.34438624463623
and you porthos continued the count as if in consideration for dartagnans embarr	40.19941424993108
porthos blushed but with pleasure rather than with confusion and yet bowing his 	137.61198193516245
yes yes my dear count i feel that you are right	16.258745723559308
athos arose	817.4343215476584
come he said stretching out his hand to dartagnan come do nt be sullen my dear s	51.1972649385773
it would have been easier to me merely to have thanked you for preserving my lif	45.737462013582096
doubtless doubtless athos	130.3650301643621
but here it is you have sentiments the devil knows what such as every one ca nt 	189.2356148296176
who could suppose that a sensible man could leave his house france his warda cha	130.60295791349685
the sentiments you air are certainly fine so fine that they are superhuman	328.30746339478486
however that may be dartagnan replied athos without falling into the snare which	66.19768878857202
dartagnan i am your prisonertreat me as such	133.70056407969633
ah pardieu said dartagnan you know you will not be my prisoner very long	50.5884103488431
no said aramis they will doubtless treat us like the prisoners of the philipghau	34.22034070621075
and how were they treated asked dartagnan	57.79247284375586
why said aramis onehalf were hanged and the other half were shot	122.94364667741934
well i said dartagnan i answer that while there remains a drop of blood in my ve	62.37463384143488
sang diou let them come on besidesdo you see that door athos	36.45761665138316
yes what then	182.37816190148894
well you can go out by that door whenever you please for from this moment you ar	67.08335529756366
i recognize you there my brave dartagnan replied athos but you are no longer our	44.18718186106245
that door is guarded dartagnan you know that	71.89471456878658
very well you will force it said porthos	22.753693584106262
there are only a dozen men at the most	36.87099552608003
that would be nothing for us four it is too much for us two	54.98065372137285
no divided as we now are we must perish	247.09438604493477
see the fatal example on the vendomois road dartagnan you so brave and you porth	87.5368811620122
now that never happened to us when we were four together	52.00612071802055
let us die then as de winter has died as for me i will fly only on condition tha	67.47751129546754
impossible said dartagnan we are under mazarins orders	69.33512853601889
i know it and i have nothing more to say my arguments lead to nothing doubtless 	85.783449840081
besides said aramis had they taken effect it would be still better not to compro	70.60827252178335
be assured gentlemen we shall do you honor in our dying	100.56397251028123
as for myself i shall be proud to face the bullets or even the rope in company w	66.88038028950778
dartagnan said nothing but after having gnawed the flower stalk he began to bite	166.8014399906421
at last	31.249890941576307
do you imagine he resumed that they mean to kill you and wherefore should they d	102.76627719131011
fool cried aramis knowest thou not then mordaunt i have but exchanged with him o	64.38359200097797
the truth is i m very sorry that i did not strangle him as you advised me said p	29.784862415768576
eh i make no account of the harm mordaunt can do cried dartagnan	115.7997086433848

stop cried athos extending his hand to one of the grated windows by which the ro	29.006670360356132
in fact looking at the place to which athos pointed dartagnan saw a cavalier com	45.63929471159374
it was mordaunt	8.657029820834742
dartagnan rushed out of the room	17.948225034916398
porthos wanted to follow him	52.92868827138182
stay said dartagnan and do not come till you hear me drum my fingers on the door	41.960188556446674
when mordaunt arrived opposite the house he saw dartagnan on the threshold and t	29.09956563774511
halloo he cried are the prisoners still there	90.76464039816199
yes sir answered the sergeant uncovering	62.622105547754394

what is the matter if you please	8.9803922686948
sir replied mordaunt i have ordered the two prisoners we made this morning to be	47.126014095046585
wherefore sir excuse curiosity but i wish to be enlightened on the subject	92.0243523730884

mordaunts very lips grew white with rage	459.0291309477774
dartagnan now saw that affairs were growing worse and he beat the guards march u	284.59232573030283
at the first beat porthos rushed out and stood on the other side of the door	29.499798712508543
this movement was observed by mordaunt	49.47450805534555
sir he thus addressed dartagnan your resistance is useless these prisoners have 	479.56603597269554
these words struck dartagnan like a thunderbolt	58.74647905475028
the blood mounted to his temples his eyes became dim he saw from what fountainhe	84.79928517224089
as for porthos he looked inquiringly at dartagnan	16.61707869583039
this look of porthoss made the gascon regret that he had summoned the brute forc	67.9589940931229
violence he said to himself would spoil all dartagnan my friend prove to this yo	84.2722363500173

mordaunt delighted advanced porthos looking at dartagnan with openmouthed astoni	104.2585582628916
then dartagnan trod on his foot and porthos began to understand that this was me	78.04826842385857
mordaunt put his foot on the first step of the door and with his hat in hand pre	30.794268548582128
but pardon said dartagnan with the most charming smile and putting his hand on t	25.17145540343321

otherwise you see although i am sure that general oliver cromwell can intend the	69.33195469835997
mordaunt recoiled he felt the blow and discharged a terrible look at dartagnan w	51.86525824325848
when i tell you a thing sir said mordaunt you insult me by doubting it	34.602287815467115
i cried dartagnan i doubt what you say god keep me from it my dear monsieur mord	47.835158217040686

mordaunt completely deceived by the wordy civility of dartagnan smiled like a ma	118.14408576468345

ask him then for the written order	169.92398347729286
what will that cost you my dear monsieur mordaunt	29.26685900405757
yes the written order said porthos who now began to comprehend what dartagnan wa	93.19394490047047
however inclined mordaunt was to have recourse to violence he understood the rea	102.61350219133777
he decided therefore not only to fetch the order but the two thousand pistoles a	102.40175650364607
he therefore mounted his horse and disappeared	121.76326683955313
good thought dartagnan a quarter of an hour to go to the tent a quarter of an ho	27.652627348141266
then turning without the least change of countenance to porthos he said looking 	128.8477675348607

go to the stable you will find mousqueton there saddle your horses put your pist	74.0597378647057

i go he said only shall i enter the chamber where those gentlemen are	116.16665761902526
no it is not worth while	35.647948745940894
well do me the kindness to take my purse which i left on the mantelpiece	70.21062500050422
all right	102.17612267135209
he then proceeded with his usual calm gait to the stable and went into the very 	49.45456564519101
at the corner of the street he met mousqueton and took him with him	16.124786128715797
dartagnan meantime went into the house whistling a tune which he had begun befor	68.11004112446429
my dear athos i have reflected on your arguments and i am convinced	32.36419401153249
i am sorry to have had anything to do with this matter	26.23327934095227
as you say mazarin is a knave	31.58429000881264
i have resolved to fly with you not a wordbe ready	90.04606639778802
your swords are in the corner do not forget them they are in many circumstances 	92.11584505932908
he put it into his pocket	17.972607290929698
the two friends were perfectly stupefied	55.75183156929807
well pray is there anything to be so surprised at he said	78.61574898950718
i was blind athos has made me see that s all come here	79.1997039558786
the two friends went near him	23.816779838976217

very true replied the gascon but i always run away from compliments	53.42115737063297
do nt forget the signal jesus seigneur and he went out as he came in whistling t	36.785236352248745
the soldiers were playing or sleeping two of them were singing in a corner out o	135.9343217347656
dartagnan called the sergeant	141.82151633000967
my dear friend general cromwell has sent monsieur mordaunt to fetch me	64.49774539644606

the sergeant made a sign as much as to say he did not understand french and dart	23.014503655385177
then he went into the stable he found the five horses saddled his own amongst th	61.07997357365472
each of you take a horse by the bridle he said to porthos and mousqueton turn to	38.937107926880174
they are coming then said porthos	16.87867912468858

you did nt forget my purse	67.00487110609154
no be easy	534.062466056862
porthos and mousqueton each took a horse by the bridle and proceeded to their po	43.68461136000615
then dartagnan being alone struck a light and lighted a small bit of tinder moun	94.57707509498238
there caressing as he pretended the animal with his hand he put this bit of burn	117.55875010672297
it was necessary to be as good a horseman as he was to risk such a scheme for no	49.153685099445866
the soldiers whom he was nearly trampling ran away	220.65181057287887
help help cried dartagnan stopmy horse has the staggers	152.77750377845695
in an instant the horses eyes grew bloodshot and he was white with foam	61.190895559620486
help cried dartagnan	37.382866424183504
what will you let me be killed jesus seigneur	43.07833820964151
no sooner had he uttered this cry than the door opened and athos and aramis rush	56.970760700070805
the coast owing to the gascons stratagem was clear	214.943490006874
the prisoners are escaping the prisoners are escaping cried the sergeant	94.00951458092757
stop stop cried dartagnan giving rein to his famous steed who darting forth over	121.7824866300669
stop stop cried the soldiers and ran for their arms	131.0103811592377
but the prisoners were in their saddles and lost no time hastening to the neares	61.60260595086011
in the middle of the street they saw grimaud and blaisois who were coming to fin	14.389539544130445
with one wave of his hand athos made grimaud who followed the little troop under	98.97707031185921
they passed through the gate like apparitions without the guards thinking of det	83.09914463183155
all this time the soldiers were calling out stop stop and the sergeant who began	94.25382610152965
whilst all this was going on a cavalier in full gallop was seen approaching	115.30326523066495
it was mordaunt with the order in his hand	33.854956980489206
the prisoners he exclaimed jumping off his horse	119.01354026227199
the sergeant had not the courage to reply he showed him the open door the empty 	83.93928713026679
mordaunt darted to the steps understood all uttered a cry as if his very heart w	156.96631483105213
chapter lix	2.8690687594286515
noble natures never lose courage nor good stomachs their appetites	145.4215359249933
the little troop without looking behind them or exchanging a word fled at a rapi	178.40262436485267
at last they came in sight of a small wood and spurring their horses afresh rode	75.37767895719905
as soon as they had disappeared behind a green curtain sufficiently thick to con	92.62474651138452
the two grooms held the horses that they might take a little rest without being 	136.62567830343121
come first of all said athos to dartagnan my friend that i may shake hands with 	58.78708319906851

to what are you not equal with your superior intelligence infallible eye your ar	226.77207245340733
now said the gascon that is all well i accept for porthos and myself everythingt	33.04893745378831
the two friends recalled by dartagnan to what was also due to porthos pressed hi	95.73463843798828
and now said athos it is not our plan to run anywhere and like madmen but we mus	47.73957904542948
what shall we do	14.985709597897271
what are we going to do ifaith it is not very difficult to say	17.552605964782252
tell us then dartagnan	30.801655411719253
we are going to reach the nearest seaport unite our little resources hire a vess	77.46914605482475
as for me i will give my last sou for it	29.3281879306474
life is the greatest treasure and speaking candidly ours hangs by a thread	284.2159956260821
what do you say to this du vallon	18.32420592109379
i said porthos i am entirely of dartagnans opinion this is a beastly country thi	61.88031888394481
you are quite decided then to leave it asked athos of dartagnan	40.835977475761645
egad i do nt see what is to keep me here	26.55920805096443
a glance was exchanged between athos and aramis	73.40054342944062
go then my friends said the former sighing	68.13891965218107
how go then exclaimed dartagnan	44.25564943419207
let us go you mean	70.44187642526022
no my friend said athos you must leave us	16.87580609707898
leave you cried dartagnan quite bewildered at this unexpected announcement	52.50091974920315
bah said porthos why separate since we are all together	70.25238577160522
because you can and ought to return to france your mission is accomplished but o	91.88504915212394
your mission is not accomplished exclaimed dartagnan looking in astonishment at 	61.468335186700045
no my friend replied athos in his gentle but decided voice we came here to defen	72.38510467464921
to save the king said dartagnan looking at aramis as he had looked at athos	19.113084880210106
aramis contented himself by making a sign with his head	67.55429419470032
dartagnans countenance took an expression of the deepest compassion he began to 	56.05793918328598
you can not be speaking seriously athos said he the king is surrounded by an arm	52.828851241612384
this army is commanded by a butcher or the son of a butcherit matters littlecolo	66.59610341636886
his majesty i can assure you will be tried on his arrival in london i have heard	49.20115885578872
a second look was exchanged between athos and aramis	85.56525560782298
and when the trial is ended there will be no delay in putting the sentence into 	92.93301345673815
and to what penalty do you think the king will be condemned asked athos	47.3579940279566
the penalty of death i greatly fear they have gone too far for him to pardon the	200.8042381514984
have you never heard what oliver cromwell said when he came to paris and was sho	24.383415480456158
what did he say asked porthos	9.74060791267763
princes must be knocked on the head	52.941195358873514
i remember it said athos	15.1642580031937
and you fancy he will not put his maxim into execution now that he has got hold 	127.78418043901468
on the contrary i am certain he will do so	16.745351845553188
but then that is all the more reason why we should not abandon the august head s	95.86478319341755
athos you are becoming mad	146.46875286970317
no my friend athos gently replied but de winter sought us out in france and intr	79.72813476848384
her majesty did us the honor to ask our aid for her husband	104.99898581678819
we engaged our word our word included everything	378.62971546384887
it was our strength our intelligence our life in short that we promised	220.17654100884815
it remains now for us to keep our word	82.65294371060865
is that your opinion dherblay	31.823752532016524

i have encountered misfortune in a high place a royal misfortune a european misf	140.32941384043554
if we can succeed in saving the king it will be good if we die for him it will b	54.20341798784573
so you know beforehand you must perish said dartagnan	79.48455037321385
we fear so and our only regret is to die so far from both of you	180.18507345213928
what will you do in a foreign land an enemys country	110.84800333137613
i traveled in england when i was young i speak english like an englishman and ar	88.30475467082111
ah if we had you my friends with you dartagnan with you porthosall four reunited	99.54879503620951
and did you promise the queen resumed dartagnan petulantly to storm the tower of	94.83565831587548
in heavens name my dear athos do not make a useless sacrifice	50.8980610291771
when i see you merely you look like a reasonable being when you speak i seem to 	125.08098060425769
come porthos join me say frankly what do you think of this business	77.68143601636109
nothing good replied porthos	36.02503849722424
come continued dartagnan who irritated that instead of listening to him athos se	56.1858567381958
well then believe me athos your mission is ended and ended nobly return to franc	209.83621646813359
friend said athos our resolution is irrevocable	61.63398581201424
then you have some other motive unknown to us	98.73153170082699
athos smiled and dartagnan struck his hands together in anger and muttered the m	97.41572043737523
very well cried dartagnan at last furious very well since you wish it let us lea	52.85143958506181
only reflect my good fellow said athos it is but dying rather sooner	139.9287688422097
pooh a little sooner or a little later it is nt worth quarreling over	128.05903631287865
if i am astonished at anything remarked porthos sententiously it is that it has 	53.872682196272244
oh it will happen you may be sure said dartagnan	27.357467459117014
so it is agreed and if porthos makes no objection	74.09258757240417
i said porthos i will do whatever you please and besides i think what the comte 	37.80679043273193
but your future career dartagnanyour ambition porthos	296.314535118789
our future our ambition replied dartagnan with feverish volubility	116.23608525902549
need we think of that since we are to save the king the king savedwe shall assem	69.11578212440757
and he will make us dukes and peers said porthos whose eyes sparkled with joy at	35.78422017649547
or he will forget us added dartagnan	53.74113813507905
oh said porthos	5.482177863521017
well that has happened friend porthos	86.15242462835607
it seems to me that we once rendered anne of austria a service not much less tha	47.306783062260145
but none the less anne of austria has forgotten us for twenty years	102.30619401270717
well in spite of that dartagnan said athos you are not sorry that you were usefu	19.401865564187183
no indeed said dartagnan i admit even that in my darkest moments i find consolat	48.24571476357115
you see then dartagnan though princes often are ungrateful god never is	486.2232687648203
athos said dartagnan i believe that were you to fall in with the devil you would	42.97535418588704
so then said athos offering his hand to dartagnan	13.953032776471296
tis settled replied dartagnan	36.87059994533574
i find england a charming country and i staybut on one condition only	166.05593918964385
what is it	5.314573867727567
that i am not forced to learn english	32.79518093487465
well now said athos triumphantly i swear to you my friend by the god who hears u	49.16610897014755
so be it said dartagnan but ii confess i have a contrary conviction	94.53627033334453
our good dartagnan said aramis represents among us the opposition in parliament 	171.395349556714

well now that everything is decided cried porthos rubbing his hands suppose we t	99.73523605475565
oh yes speak of dinner in a country where for a feast they eat boiled mutton and	179.79868127803562
what the devil did you come to such a country for athos but i forgot added the g	38.61332232543114
my plan	628.9008048103276
yes have you a plan	68.6522873719953
no i am hungry that is all	40.34269530836466
pardieu if that is all i am hungry too but it is not everything to be hungry one	52.357418828028905
ah exclaimed aramis who was not quite so indifferent to the good things of the e	44.41259379260455
and the legs of mutton of the salt marshes said porthos smacking his lips	90.79914107624671
but suggested dartagnan have we not our friend mousqueton who managed for us so 	95.7234092377028
yes said porthos we have mousqueton but since he has been steward he has become 	43.47443943847155
here mouston cried porthos	16.36101890383487
mouston appeared with a most piteous face	117.7099191627629
what is the matter my dear m	9.090204705107565
mouston asked dartagnan	42.581647854547356
are you ill	21.66853515844751
sir i am very hungry replied mouston	20.019737163324557
well it is just for that reason that we have called you my good m	50.340882489804486
could you not procure us a few of those nice little rabbits and some of those de	81.95910768383881
at the hotel of said porthos by my faithnor do i remember it either	68.67458418183702
it does not matter and a few of those bottles of old burgundy wine which cured y	85.6225181328093
alas sir said mousqueton i much fear that what you ask for are very rare things 	85.29952616310007
how is there a house in the neighborhood asked dartagnan	26.27565024053328
yes sir replied mousqueton	6.893337349775227
well let us as you say go and ask a dinner from the master of that house	70.96098794507922
what is your opinion gentlemen and does not m	59.61861590018816
moustons suggestion appear to you full of sense	315.88139227139584
oh said aramis suppose the master is a puritan	54.59545553647109
so much the better mordioux replied dartagnan if he is a puritan we will inform 	22.77036499153078
but if he should be a cavalier said porthos	28.279599375990657
in that case we will put on an air of mourning and he will pluck for us his blac	36.54438941030026
you are very happy exclaimed athos laughing in spite of himself at the sally of 	18.841005403435556
what would you have said dartagnan	8.666271135296562
i come from a land where there is not a cloud in the sky	90.31318839742974
it is not like this then said porthos stretching out his hand to assure himself 	46.30476604020169
come come said dartagnan more reason why we should start on our journey	56.34930787113988
halloo grimaud	4.8775980737597155
grimaud appeared	265.147939730584
well grimaud my friend have you seen anything asked the gascon	25.433781287121107
nothing replied grimaud	9.623925001895698
those idiots cried porthos they have not even pursued us	83.36585009891746
oh if we had been in their place	35.44527033633878
yes they are wrong said dartagnan	22.38719260322606
i would willingly have said two words to mordaunt in this little desert	124.65133444426856
it is an excellent spot for bringing down a man in proper style	107.08874616782103
i think decidedly observed aramis gentlemen that the son has nt his mothers ener	120.58490455158905
what my good fellow replied athos wait awhile we have scarcely left him two hour	105.8945846324947
we may say that he is not equal to his mother when we put foot in france if we a	57.841435868276484
meanwhile let us dine suggested porthos	95.65081641219334
ifaith yes said athos for i am hungry	39.86184335612966
look out for the black fowls cried aramis	81.88441858154204
and the four friends guided by mousqueton took up the way toward the house alrea	36.56949106810863
chapter lx	2.3506491062288135
respect to fallen majesty	435.54979721196173
as our fugitives approached the house they found the ground cut up as if a consi	59.181152585464694
before the door the traces were yet more apparent these horsemen whoever they mi	203.3012120623255
egad cried dartagnan its quite clear that the king and his escort have been by h	81.94597746998357
the devil said porthos in that case they have eaten everything	54.73474100293787
bah said dartagnan they will have left a chicken at least	27.092909738669828
he dismounted and knocked on the door	61.90003258950482
there was no response	51.186719713144626
he pushed open the door and found the first room empty and deserted	72.44066207994875
well cried porthos	21.82020010598698
i can see nobody said dartagnan	66.80394925653488
at this word the three friends leaped from their horses and entered	36.47173547376365
dartagnan had already opened the door of the second room and from the expression	31.078382164811803
the three friends drew near and discovered a young man stretched on the ground b	55.12403662321034
it was evident that he had attempted to regain his bed but had not had sufficien	24.66205334330803
athos who imagined that he saw him move was the first to go up to him	63.429862549302214
well inquired dartagnan	38.46643317769014
well if he is dead said athos he has not been so long for he is still warm	23.830002736862127
but no his heart is beating	205.6411736249084
ho there my friend	68.73433995104658
the wounded man heaved a sigh	50.09389694840219
dartagnan took some water in the hollow of his hand and threw it upon his face	36.15350134373861
the man opened his eyes made an effort to raise his head and fell back again	36.940754344079835
the wound was in the top of his skull and blood was flawing copiously	74.83571313906099
aramis dipped a cloth into some water and applied it to the gash	101.21313166750072
again the wounded man opened his eyes and looked in astonishment at these strang	30.698759018048474
you are among friends said athos in english so cheer up and tell us if you have 	50.23792501243119
the king muttered the wounded man the king is a prisoner	46.591606741388745
you have seen him asked aramis in the same language	10.201643821457877
the man made no reply	40.84579259930054
make your mind easy resumed athos we are all faithful servants of his majesty	52.04675644784198
is what you tell me true asked the wounded man	31.31193361276214
on our honor as gentlemen	145.25853404127216
then i may tell you all	25.575456900584104
i am brother to parry his majestys lackey	153.37787149950242
athos and aramis remembered that this was the name by which de winter had called	56.01881937512089
we know him said athos he never left the king	43.53645664795426
yes that is he	30.60909152113804
well he thought of me when he saw the king was taken and as they were passing be	61.63372130821001
they brought him into this room and placed sentinels at the doors and windows	76.15322731075113
parry knew this room as he had often been to see me when the king was at newcast	42.138177581931075
he knew that there was a trapdoor communicating with a cellar from which one cou	63.71945895623735
he made a sign which i understood but the kings guards must have noticed it and 	57.21918848269167
i went out as if to fetch wood passed through the subterranean passage into the 	102.38017637640735
alas he would not	21.215040510702895
but parry clasped his hands and implored him and at last he agreed	75.28360331390144
i went on first fortunately	333.96497089751546
the king was a few steps behind me when suddenly i saw something rise up in fron	76.03044426191644
i wanted to cry out to warn the king but that very moment i felt a blow as if th	76.3999714661636
when i came to myself again i was stretched in the same place	39.33753775286233
i dragged myself as far as the yard	70.14119035935458
the king and his escort were no longer there	41.95454662985125
i spent perhaps an hour in coming from the yard to this place then my strength g	139.66579309662941
and now how are you feeling	105.45005803448748
very ill replied the wounded man	42.013083471873934
can we do anything for you asked athos	31.383780292682047
help to put me on the bed i think i shall feel better there	74.76024292608194
have you any one to depend on for assistance	71.19800388592161
my wife is at durham and may return at any moment	64.08660713009776
but youis there nothing that you want	281.9981581117577
we came here with the intention of asking for something to eat	116.61492615846787
alas they have taken everything there is nt a morsel of bread in the house	37.922208210985765
you hear dartagnan said athos we shall have to look elsewhere for our dinner	59.59263803011303
it is all one to me now said dartagnan i am no longer hungry	26.5304753769344
faith neither am i said porthos	72.0991888062393
they carried the man to his bed and called grimaud to dress the wound	74.27196328547112
in the service of the four friends grimaud had had so frequent occasion to make 	39.22213241753997
in the meantime the fugitives had returned to the first room where they took cou	25.961611770327718
now said aramis we know how the matter stands	42.124486393835475
the king and his escort have gone this way we had better take the opposite direc	103.88146249510903
athos did not reply he reflected	42.929250887829575
yes said porthos let us take the opposite direction if we follow the escort we s	63.26692679048609
what a confounded country this england is this is the first time i have gone wit	76.42343621115367
what do you think dartagnan asked athos	6.597784359594714
do you agree with aramis	36.98962346339442
not at all said dartagnan i am precisely of the contrary opinion	36.622609944653256
what you would follow the escort exclaimed porthos in dismay	106.25040973144223
no i would join the escort	82.77225102054572
athoss eyes shone with joy	105.9027145546826
join the escort cried aramis	19.983318337881855
let dartagnan speak said athos you know he always has wise advice to give	97.15709759513113
clearly said dartagnan we must go where they will not look for us	26.412341117417974
now they will be far from looking for us among the puritans therefore with the p	68.22504313998915
good my friend good said athos	23.569783114305036
it is excellent advice	150.74601334281982
i was about to give it when you anticipated me	42.796420579631544
that then is your opinion asked aramis	22.555979012354126
they will think we are trying to leave england and will search for us at the por	40.76603520077781
once in london we shall be hard to findwithout considering continued athos throw	93.5510673019246
yes said aramis i understand	9.207987517144582
i however do not understand said porthos	65.46300514207462
but no matter since it is at the same time the opinion of dartagnan and of athos	21.52987610713991
but said aramis shall we not be suspected by colonel harrison	51.83681270625518
egad cried dartagnan he s just the man i count upon	85.87094876062234
colonel harrison is one of our friends	23.64737500306113
we have met him twice at general cromwells	90.24994852800256
he knows that we were sent from france by monsieur mazarin he will consider us a	54.68780803059255
besides is he not a butchers son well then porthos shall show him how to knock d	131.62841937879944
that will insure his confidence	502.8709498270861
athos smiled	86.49934921740959
you are the best companion that i know dartagnan he said offering his hand to th	28.942204518432764
this was as we have seen the term which athos applied to dartagnan in his more e	53.96441676684437
at this moment grimaud came in	11.594230930676845
he had stanched the wound and the man was better	81.96391480601223
the four friends took leave of him and asked if they could deliver any message f	66.69102466773295
tell him answered the brave man to let the king know that they have not killed m	58.10180506196238
however insignificant i am i am sure that his majesty is concerned for me and bl	37.75997450961799
be easy said dartagnan he will know all before night	98.30507345921812
the little troop recommenced their march and at the end of two hours perceived a	53.93656880582652
my dear friends said dartagnan give your swords to monsieur mouston who will ret	31.545615589375746
it was not long before they joined the escort	78.7520569671984
the king was riding in front surrounded by troopers and when he saw athos and ar	60.39652948544496
dartagnan passed to the head of the column and leaving his friends under the gua	32.322560913214424
it turned out as dartagnan had foreseen	123.29624767980053
the colonel neither had nor could have any suspicion	389.4410943210568
they halted for the king to dine	74.10714500305886
this time however due precautions were taken to prevent any attempt at escape	239.82749892402208
in the large room of the hotel a small table was placed for him and a large one 	39.55036302150216
will you dine with me asked harrison of dartagnan	18.696112966421023
gad i should be very happy but i have my companion monsieur du vallon and the tw	22.60289495419152
let us manage it better	53.603294812785435
have a table set for us in a corner and send us whatever you like from yours	160.09127992131877
good answered harrison	18.745893627704625
the matter was arranged as dartagnan had suggested and when he returned he found	86.45407284900833
the table at which the puritan officers were seated was round and whether by cha	117.32998267116976
the king saw the four gentlemen come in but appeared to take no notice of them	96.53468946247989
they sat down in such a manner as to turn their backs on nobody	91.37232530618768
the officers table and that of the king were opposite to them	115.4104727776176
ifaith colonel said dartagnan we are very grateful for your gracious invitation 	69.97292538339727
my friend here monsieur du vallon shares my gratitude for he was particularly hu	107.32886206902648
and i am so still said porthos bowing to harrison	26.774037570094485
and how said harrison laughing did this serious calamity of going without breakf	135.07534954165376
in a very simple manner colonel said dartagnan	51.33938540362686
i was in a hurry to join you and took the road you had already gone by	42.06399913361712
you can understand our disappointment when arriving at a pretty little house on 	243.91527384851577
yes said harrison laughing and looking over at one of the officers seated at his	34.14693355658052
when groslow undertakes this kind of thing there s no need to go over the ground	158.56006795309543
ah it was this gentleman said dartagnan bowing to the officer	32.210137029103095
i am sorry he does not speak french that i might tender him my compliments	60.4732419240976
i am ready to receive and return them sir said the officer in pretty good french	67.90664718039699
then sir allow me to assure you that your blow was so well directed that you hav	47.676518908391444
nearly i thought i had quite said groslow	54.69156327328873
it was a very near thing but he is not dead	31.08561483807548
as he said this dartagnan gave a glance at parry who was standing in front of th	36.09192322963335
the king too who had listened in the greatest agony now breathed again	209.99396667829959
hang it said groslow i thought i had succeeded better	44.59856114638275
if it were not so far from here to the house i would return and finish him	51.68719024947764
and you would do well if you are afraid of his recovering for you know if a woun	39.83661874081781
and dartagnan threw a second glance toward parry on whose face such an expressio	77.87547854519335
parry bent over his masters hand and kissed it respectfully	44.389293985233195
i ve a great desire to drink the kings health said athos	61.17549146587617
let me propose it then said dartagnan	28.97737630240875
do said aramis	24.781958524436277
porthos looked at dartagnan quite amazed at the resources with which his compani	37.72552797409624
dartagnan took up his camp tin cup filled it with wine and arose	96.92753545191624
gentlemen said he let us drink to him who presides at the repast	55.86298587245035
heres to our colonel and let him know that we are always at his commands as far 	89.68098261953256
and as dartagnan as he spoke looked at harrison the colonel imagined the toast w	54.069596733471315
he arose and bowed to the four friends whose eyes were fixed on charles while ha	41.68638353188601
the king in return looked at the four gentlemen and drank with a smile full of n	49.69246298912714
come gentlemen cried harrison regardless of his illustrious captive let us be of	73.87076462833285
where do we sleep colonel	439.58523831342586
at thirsk replied harrison	17.857662703218416
parry said the king rising too my horse i desire to go to thirsk	52.18696715117718
egad said dartagnan to athos your king has thoroughly taken me and i am quite at	35.72829647454143
if what you say is sincere replied athos he will never reach london	83.6194947593645
how so	26.044891709515014
because before then we shall have carried him off	101.26343335674757
well this time athos said dartagnan upon my word you are mad	39.937641641761466
have you some plan in your head then asked aramis	36.032185286058706
ay said porthos the thing would not be impossible with a good plan	43.06914693512826
i have none said athos but dartagnan will discover one	52.9764860660597
dartagnan shrugged his shoulders and they proceeded	30.165422544848436
chapter lxi	2.190125509129641
dartagnan hits on a plan	196.09285459536125
as night closed in they arrived at thirsk	170.6408706308708
the four friends appeared to be entire strangers to one another and indifferent 	91.19138537031519
they withdrew to a private house and as they had reason every moment to fear for	119.46550264804836
the lackeys were sent to their several posts except that grimaud lay on a truss 	77.36552436812995
dartagnan was thoughtful and seemed for the moment to have lost his usual loquac	45.50050899736172
porthos who could never see anything that was not selfevident talked to him as u	55.52962998307816
he replied in monosyllables and athos and aramis looked significantly at one ano	54.8816957431183
next morning dartagnan was the first to rise	27.138403062313305
he had been down to the stables already taken a look at the horses and given the	61.70609070311472
at eight oclock the march was resumed in the same order as the night before exce	45.01664664122974
groslow whom dartagnans praises had greatly pleased welcomed him with a gracious	228.77233457678545
really sir dartagnan said to him i am pleased to find one with whom to talk in m	66.59569059619128
my friend monsieur du vallon is of a very melancholy disposition so much so that	39.14323093171609
as for our two prisoners you can imagine that they are but little in the vein fo	59.38125789658916
they are hot royalists said groslow	29.345422228790195
the more reason they should be sulky with us for having captured the stuart for 	83.74886261313478
why said groslow that is just what we are taking him to london for	29.087517040270154
and you never by any chance lose sight of him i presume	114.16449887062551
i should think not indeed	190.83561283247215
you see he has a truly royal escort	254.41896874353105
ay there s no fear in the daytime but at night	79.36578107404254
we redouble our precautions	192.55047623965055
and what method of surveillance do you employ	88.5492710056927
eight men remain constantly in his room	96.17342282281858
the deuce he is well guarded then	180.94689016219797
but besides these eight men you doubtless place some guard outside	743.2248552710915
oh no just think	278.2916706717961
what would you have two men without arms do against eight armed men	124.6165678365337
two menhow do you mean	46.2893348087282
yes the king and his lackey	84.3003297411036
oh then they allow the lackey to remain with him	91.83888058211477
yes stuart begged this favor and harrison consented	390.0603384740076
under pretense that he s a king it appears he can not dress or undress without a	92.96940230251306
really captain said dartagnan determined to continue on the laudatory tack on wh	67.7231367447954
you have lived three years in paris may i ask what you were doing there	55.57331035035015
my father who is a merchant placed me with his correspondent who in turn sent hi	163.1364307544875
were you pleased with paris sir	61.06462652110173
yes but you are much in want of a revolution like our ownnot against your king w	100.31947199772478
ah i am quite of your opinion sir and we should soon make an end of mazarin if w	27.645989094632412
but said the officer i thought you were in his service and that it was he who se	25.787486987164716
that is to say i am in the kings service and that knowing he wanted to send some	43.06151812663303
so that when he proposed to us to draw our swords in honor of old england you se	53.640523156913986
yes i know that you charged by the side of mordaunt	28.055003771396212
on his right and left sir	144.83069412687385
ah there s another brave and excellent young man	132.7504601699573
do you know him asked the officer	15.048132264311217
yes very well	74.7694764478459
monsieur du vallon and myself came from france with him	37.30843877021854
it appears too you kept him waiting a long time at boulogne	111.05793625602664
what would you have i was like you and had a king in keeping	67.68462226131066
aha said groslow what king	66.08134594996926
our own to be sure the little onelouis xiv	46.27365497159435
and how long had you to take care of him	43.75531497269753
three nights and by my troth i shall always remember those three nights with a c	82.55423623883523
how do you mean	4.438878986518978
i mean that my friends officers in the guards and mousquetaires came to keep me 	100.09928546312574
ah true said the englishman with a sigh you frenchmen are born boon companions	74.75289970361716
and do nt you play too when you are on guard	70.4190729794894
never said the englishman	10.263084603625964
in that case you must be horribly bored and have my sympathy	45.526313252073685
the fact is i look to my turn for keeping guard with horror	172.60409430628053
its tiresome work to keep awake a whole night	258.24514333368813
yes but with a jovial partner and dice and guineas clinking on the cloth the nig	62.46612945970113
you do nt like playing then	145.78555292796028
on the contrary i do	8.968140738519887
lansquenet for instance	96.23163558271071
devoted to it	49.21926230133448
i used to play almost every night in france	186.8486621662983
and since your return to england	73.88866075310749
i have not handled a card or dicebox	136.378729479353
i sincerely pity you said dartagnan with an air of profound compassion	50.915465656481786
look here said the englishman	15.132958938007896
tomorrow i am on guard	38.220592576725714
in stuarts room	102.44957121764799
yes come and pass the night with me	92.27344819332568
impossible why so	252.39717852685976
i play with monsieur du vallon every night	224.6041551574304
sometimes we do nt go to bed at all	26.909702412373488
well what of that	59.89135422532687
why he would be annoyed if i did not play with him	42.35883246227444
does he play well	197.61933324760628
i have seen him lose as much as two thousand pistoles laughing all the while til	114.45840556447101
bring him with you then	58.023895193843586
but how about our prisoners	339.0520906084568
let your servants guard them	200.0815689543728
yes and give them a chance of escaping said dartagnan	52.46708416256626
why one of them is a rich lord from touraine and the other a knight of malta of 	36.806343708412086
we have arranged the ransom of each of them2000 on arriving in france	125.89314393373613
we are reluctant to leave for a single moment men whom our lackeys know to be mi	77.43199315816774
it is true we plundered them a little when we took them and i will even confess 	97.61766805574251
still they may have concealed some precious stone some valuable diamond so that 	470.4007340778293
we have made ourselves the constant guardians of our men and while i sleep monsi	97.77293499464076
ah ah said groslow	4.7260769454515525
you see then why i must decline your polite invitation which is especially attra	211.0138861748719
ah said groslow sighing there is something still more wearisome and that is not 	34.376298984150225
i can understand that said dartagnan	31.954904241405586
but come resumed the englishman are these men of yours dangerous	142.83804081735587
in what respect	89.40686251096766
are they capable of attempting violence	509.0201883468027
dartagnan burst out laughing at the idea	144.98768496322933
jesus dieu he cried one of them is trembling with fever having failed to adapt h	122.04588812319851
well then said groslow bring them with you	39.444507460296435
but really said dartagnan	38.821174256520266
i have eight men on guard you know	99.1726072231319
four of them can guard the king and the other four your prisoners	75.16225821369426
ill manage it somehow you will see	223.18487619038595
but said dartagnan now i think of itwhat is to prevent our beginning tonight	88.82694551051159
nothing at all said groslow	16.346627491689365
just so	75.30011821401958
come to us this evening and tomorrow well return your visit	101.21568959547312
capital this evening with you tomorrow at stuarts the next day with me	64.02194663212615
you see that with a little forethought one can lead a merry life anywhere and ev	96.74846514220998
yes with frenchmen and frenchmen like you	59.40360278479281
and monsieur du vallon added the other	30.52237106444416
you will see what a fellow he is a man who nearly killed mazarin between two doo	85.74607105694601
they employ him because they are afraid of him	81.96575174828627
ah there he is calling me now	86.97232809203268
you ll excuse me i know	60.71522535318743
they exchanged bows and dartagnan returned to his companions	81.57385515647088
what on earth can you have been saying to that bulldog exclaimed porthos	84.40353973138063
my dear fellow do nt speak like that of monsieur groslow	35.4298171725958
he s one of my most intimate friends	49.0099142712555
one of your friends cried porthos this butcher of unarmed farmers	67.42595321977988
hush my dear porthos	10.190255038452928
monsieur groslow is perhaps rather hasty its true but at bottom i have discovere	98.48664917487254
porthos opened his eyes in amazement athos and aramis looked at one another and 	31.029191329811063
but continued dartagnan you shall judge of him for yourself	47.9122482233161
he is coming to play with us this evening	32.18617823991171
oho said porthos his eyes glistening at the news	35.513296953308064
is he rich	125.65438908234199
he s the son of one of the wealthiest merchants in london	32.1521016742969
and knows lansquenet	10975.314069777283
adores it	187.98335043071316
his mania	1626.7269295504598
revels in it	151.54658916618666
good said porthos we shall pass an agreeable evening	48.89411397217933
the more so as it will be the prelude to a better	87.17203560540895
how so	26.325413194635384
we invite him to play tonight he has invited us in return tomorrow	96.1158410861942
but wait	1316.9114108267158
tonight we stop at derby and if there is a bottle of wine in the town let mousqu	41.56050020115212
it will be well to prepare a light supper of which you athos and aramis are not 	52.79261417277619
do you understand	8.652554169232262
that s no doubt very fine said porthos but deuce take me if i understand at all	59.736425603861115
porthos my friend you know i am descended on the fathers side from the prophets 	60.40465143677913
let those who have ears hear and those who have eyes see i can tell you nothing 	295.72479734276976
go ahead my friend said athos i am sure that whatever you do is well done	55.668046934097134
and you aramis are you of that opinion	58.99758604785046
entirely so my dear dartagnan	17.295477170973534
very good said dartagnan here indeed are true believers it is a pleasure to work	70.84363742820912
the fact is said porthos with an air of finesse i am rather incredulous	32.396687904334435
dartagnan gave him playful buffet on the shoulder and as they had reached the st	29.361175563367077
at five in the evening they sent mousqueton on before as agreed upon	154.20308593540182
blaisois went with him	41.15958456026764
in crossing the principal street in derby the four friends perceived blaisois st	38.115097232496694
it was there a lodging was prepared for them	84.6964393684993
at the hour agreed upon groslow came	105.5952228912667
dartagnan received him as he would have done a friend of twenty years standing	54.556289713118645
porthos scanned him from head to foot and smiled when he discovered that in spit	209.41100240221482
athos and aramis suppressed as well as they could the disgust they felt in the p	51.50622140189745
in short groslow seemed to be pleased with his reception	50.87308110670968
athos and aramis kept themselves to their role	69.11162967053657
at midnight they withdrew to their chamber the door of which was left open on th	44.28087439239968
furthermore dartagnan went with them leaving porthos at play with groslow	138.6434800536102
porthos gained fifty pistoles from groslow and found him a more agreeable compan	79.75756561820243
as to groslow he promised himself that on the following evening he would recover	52.45493920547262
the next day was spent as usual	66.04212759104071
dartagnan went from captain groslow to colonel harrison and from colonel harriso	101.22418431063602
to any one not acquainted with him he seemed to be in his normal condition but t	53.938613501917324
what is he contriving asked aramis	16.68812294706644
wait said athos	5.170777241502698
porthos said nothing but he handled in his pocket the fifty pistoles he had gain	73.08102492449537
arrived at ryston dartagnan assembled his friends	47.59124070539632
his face had lost the expression of careless gayety it had worn like a mask the 	154.00989730939034
athos pinched aramiss hand	229.7185443445167
the moment is at hand he said	56.811412201090164
yes returned dartagnan who had overheard him tonight gentlemen we rescue the kin	113.71003302074911
dartagnan said athos this is no joke i trust it would quite cut me up	62.01853549847058
you are a very odd man athos he replied to doubt me thus	61.37590117695847
where and when have you seen me trifle with a friends heart and a kings life i h	116.53893707428273
you left it to me to discover the means and i have done so	41.08956805014874
porthos looked at dartagnan with an expression of profound admiration	7.5593282146314555
aramis smiled as one who hopes	451.22866978229825
athos was pale and trembled in every limb	31.46521279299463
speak said athos	4.8526907190598205
we are invited replied dartagnan to pass the night with m	64.91783582137015
but do you know where	17.202514760519634
in the kings room	18.87246247874227
the kings room cried athos	103.8159489638421
yes gentlemen in the kings room	39.532205893996036
groslow is on guard there this evening and to pass the time away he has invited 	112.58447865665646
all four of us asked athos	41.515855347707735
pardieu certainly all four we could nt leave our prisoners could we	320.2395132705987
ah ah said aramis	4.672815383814379
tell us about it said athos palpitating	35.059818819262794
we are going then we two with our swords you with daggers	113.7492959240867
we four have got to master these eight fools and their stupid captain	432.3579882166463
monsieur porthos what do you say to that	13.617679266053369
i say it is easy enough answered porthos	32.99829547374365
we dress the king in groslows clothes	243.08300221432413
mousqueton grimaud and blaisois have our horses saddled at the end of the first 	28.64259985116673
we mount them and before daylight are twenty leagues distant	332.77164146682577
athos placed his two hands on dartagnans shoulders and gazed at him with his cal	25.352812034106023
i declare my friend said he that there is not a creature under the sky who equal	97.3889216460208
whilst we thought you indifferent to our sorrows which you could nt share withou	181.79504128306547
i repeat it dartagnan you are the best one among us i bless and love you my dear	93.28264156192786
and to think that i could nt find that out said porthos scratching his head it i	79.89642479726426
but said aramis if i understand rightly we are to kill them all eh	43.7390126693211
athos shuddered and turned pale	68.81038741691091
mordioux answered dartagnan i believe we must	37.59439223344389
i confess i can discover no other safe and satisfactory way	290.6944403066856
let us see said aramis how are we to act	21.408456977259146
i have arranged two plans	164.1603848604684
firstly at a given signal which shall be the words at last you each plunge a dag	173.74023860656342
we on our side do the same	59.95561657051885
that will be four killed	268.61237309025404
we shall then be matched four against the remaining five	238.34179778693965
if these five men give themselves up we gag them if they resist we kill them	189.88850284033464
if by chance our amphitryon changes his mind and receives only porthos and mysel	129.3010642419989
it will take a little longer time and may make a greater disturbance but you wil	79.11632419278905
but if you yourselves should be struck said athos	88.96038228639004
impossible said dartagnan those beer drinkers are too clumsy and awkward	122.78850802766789
besides you will strike at the throat porthos it kills as quickly and prevents a	146.66402074927203
very good said porthos it will be a nice little throat cutting	53.712035141624696
horrible horrible exclaimed athos	86.374463762705
nonsense said dartagnan you would do as much mr	25.435806705686453
humanity in a battle	74.23928184963647
but if you think the kings life is not worth what it must cost there s an end of	53.74445677496219
no you are right said athos	7.912967765333051
at this moment a soldier entered to inform them that groslow was waiting for the	33.13088304526312
where asked dartagnan	35.384586364033545
in the room of the english nebuchadnezzar replied the staunch puritan	24.31245520886305
good replied athos whose blood mounted to his face at the insult offered to roya	55.74810985723477
the puritan then went out	61.33152023791124
the lackeys had been ordered to saddle eight horses and to wait keeping together	206.9885620769432
it was nine oclock in the evening the sentinels had been relieved at eight and c	36.815295619354195
dartagnan and porthos armed with their swords and athos and aramis each carrying	70.52058651730441
the two latter followed their captors in the humble guise of captives without ar	130.64381758492974
ods bodikins said groslow as the four friends entered i had almost given you up	85.35587823641251
dartagnan went up to him and whispered in his ear	23.06399543246316
the fact is we that is monsieur du vallon and i hesitated a little	66.09032692195187
and why	82.15137761844474
dartagnan looked significantly toward athos and aramis	46.487693519456826
aha said groslow on account of political opinions no matter	116.63060819786924
on the contrary he added laughing if they want to see their stuart they shall se	46.25643644486931
are we to pass the night in the kings room asked dartagnan	25.406811304043043
no but in the one next to it and as the door will remain open it comes to the sa	57.92752484081976
have you provided yourself with money i assure you i intend to play the devils g	72.29428131676308
dartagnan rattled the gold in his pockets	131.799754588944
very good said groslow and opened the door of the room	18.576364007994503
i will show you the way and he went in first	53.43710596957913
dartagnan turned to look at his friends	20.973452574986055
porthos was perfectly indifferent athos pale but resolute aramis was wiping a sl	77.10849169639654
the eight guards were at their posts	98.4387594861722
four in the kings room two at the door between the rooms and two at that by whic	69.05816440798124
athos smiled when he saw their bare swords he felt it was no longer to be a butc	38.989361688873906
charles was perceived through the door lying dressed upon his bed at the head of	82.23281910023364
a candle of coarse tallow on a black table lighted up the handsome and resigned 	150.88675070387026
from time to time parry stopped thinking the king whose eyes were closed was rea	101.34453829483324
go on my good parry i am listening	31.769473277791587
groslow advanced to the door of the kings room replaced on his head the hat he h	37.54438396918836
capital cried the gascon you would make a distinguished general	78.29663506959507
and do you think asked groslow that stuart will ever escape while i am on guard	46.32819867013536
no to be sure replied dartagnan unless forsooth the sky rains friends upon him	143.12309481250222
groslows face brightened	1572.4762350433061
it is impossible to say whether charles who kept his eyes constantly closed had 	68.89594694267801
parry too started and stopped reading	614.8871124710554
what are you thinking about said the king go on my good parry unless you are tir	34.02593317762255
parry resumed his reading	159.80092679085453
on a table in the next room were lighted candles cards two diceboxes and dice	71.45257256555865
gentlemen said groslow i beg you will take your places	19.075891124665862
i will sit facing stuart whom i like so much to see especially where he now is a	130.12561233864295
athos turned red with rage	97.51592122931056
dartagnan frowned at him	55.4432710839701
that s it said dartagnan you monsieur le comte de la fere to the right of monsie	14.966706833807894
you chevalier dherblay to his left	190.71635237588671
du vallon next me	324.29586583228246
you ll bet for me and those gentlemen for monsieur groslow	82.9302772179824
by this arrangement dartagnan could nudge porthos with his knee and make signs w	94.00924561793366
at the names comte de la fere and chevalier dherblay charles opened his eyes and	41.215813371448206
at that moment parry turned over several leaves of his bible and read with a lou	53.77764162564545
god said hear ye the words of the prophets my servants whom i have sent unto you	148.1802999535984
the four friends exchanged glances	66.81809419859738
the words that parry had read assured them that their presence was understood by	203.44240800020285
dartagnans eyes sparkled with joy	34.27477027470315
you asked me just now if i was in funds said dartagnan placing some twenty pisto	109.16855110178315
well in my turn i advise you to keep a sharp lookout on your treasure my dear mo	52.45473910614112
not without my defending it said groslow	79.83838517026597
so much the better said dartagnan	4.929814055888207
fight my dear captain fight	197.97009387294725
you know or you do nt know that that is what we ask of you	37.395703016254146
oh yes said groslow bursting with his usual coarse laugh i know you frenchmen wa	26.162891965684558
charles had heard and understood it all	128.89059791603137
a slight color mounted to his cheeks	70.02065459225015
the soldiers then saw him stretch his limbs little by little and under the prete	115.2304935177789
athos and aramis started with delight to find that the king was lying with his c	46.89577426076097
the game began	597.5428999586838
the luck had turned and groslow having won some hundred pistoles was in the merr	150.50159963269894
porthos who had lost the fifty pistoles he had won the night before and thirty m	71.73390607214402
athos and aramis looked at him inquiringly	20.01217326508614
but dartagnan remained impassible	273.90596731867976
it struck ten	1370.0896497675892
they heard the guard going its rounds	310.8354071257695
how many rounds do they make a night asked dartagnan drawing more pistoles from 	110.96175587535632
five answered groslow one every two hours	320.1650033155063
dartagnan glanced at athos and aramis and for the first time replied to porthoss	28.491486458211334
meanwhile the soldiers whose duty it was to remain in the kings room attracted b	137.14354310577897
those on the other side had followed their example thus favoring the views of th	59.46030985016953
the two sentinels at the door still had their swords unsheathed but they were le	89.02963804336873
athos seemed to grow calm as the critical moment approached	179.07542452095726
with his white aristocratic hands he played with the louis bending and straighte	139.48642719226336
aramis less selfcontrolled fumbled continually with his hidden poniard	448.4239566210014
porthos impatient at his continued losses kept up a vigorous play with his knee	266.36205974851697
dartagnan turned mechanically looking behind him and between the figures of two 	162.05734104054585
dartagnan saw that the moment was come	37.26630905187527
he darted a preparatory glance at athos and aramis who slyly pushed their chairs	81.36601904011297
he gave porthos a second nudge of the knee and porthos got up as if to stretch h	45.11697046556196
hang it cried dartagnan another twenty pistoles lost	181.9562631760685
really captain groslow you are too much in fortunes way	97.43263022728648
this ca nt last and he drew another twenty from his pocket	126.24487298820254
one more turn captain twenty pistoles on one throwonly one the last	556.5061164725203
done for twenty replied groslow	77.47598028723964
and he turned up two cards as usual a king for dartagnan and an ace for himself	109.43978494583162
a king said dartagnan its a good omen master groslowlook out for the king	140.23028191013216
and in spite of his extraordinary selfcontrol there was a strange vibration in t	34.49427674699194
groslow began turning the cards one after another	605.238143053462
if he turned up an ace first he won if a king he lost	155.26844547783807
he turned up a king	112.26208278506031
at last cried dartagnan	36.937980129174555
at this word athos and aramis jumped up	34.52223348176014
porthos drew back a step	49.340432061068334
daggers and swords were just about to shine when suddenly the door was thrown op	76.20048477541445
behind this man could be seen the glistening muskets of half a dozen soldiers	109.3785891083163
groslow jumped up ashamed at being surprised in the midst of wine cards and dice	110.69968174887705
but harrison paid not the least attention to him and entering the kings room fol	60.250578422551186
charles stuart said he an order has come to conduct you to london without stoppi	45.84621242274284
prepare yourself then to start at once	86.11767738439703
and by whom is this order given asked the king	88.54040449725065
by general oliver cromwell	52.573519559961156
and here is mr	43.42337979881171
mordaunt who has brought it and is charged with its execution	101.77840663056546
mordaunt muttered the four friends exchanging glances	134.23089379790625
dartagnan swept up the money that he and porthos had lost and buried it in his h	63.21222566051529
athos and aramis placed themselves behind him	49.09251406464192
at this movement mordaunt turned around recognized them and uttered an exclamati	66.91891577600998
i m afraid we are prisoners whispered dartagnan to his friend	94.33255542941748
not yet replied porthos	23.30240259383804
colonel colonel cried mordaunt you are betrayed	76.08967033007387
these four frenchmen have escaped from newcastle and no doubt want to carry off 	129.10927289073166
arrest them	206.310226337637
ah my young man said dartagnan drawing his sword that is an order sooner given t	58.58451034740041
fly friends fly he added whirling his sword around him	234.60223528273877
the next moment he darted to the door and knocked down two of the soldiers who g	31.127428340938945
athos and aramis followed him	24.186285808936823
porthos brought up the rear and before soldiers officers or colonel had time to 	337.35700101106295
fire cried mordaunt fire upon them	111.43084548506543
three or four shots were fired but with no other result than to show the four fu	55.58163179099136
the horses were at the place fixed upon and they leaped lightly into their saddl	93.91049858431364
forward cried dartagnan and spur for your dear lives	207.17232399749207
they galloped away and took the road they had come by in the morning namely in t	67.1948615025528
a few hundred yards beyond the town dartagnan drew rein	99.49284532731674
halt he cried this time we shall be pursued	57.35577241488161
we must let them leave the village and ride after us on the northern road and wh	58.006273386550305
there was a stream close by and a bridge across it	182.439221328902
dartagnan led his horse under the arch of the bridge	49.23358082328296
the others followed	990.256028029281
ten minutes later they heard the rapid gallop of a troop of horsemen	42.05050248218184
a few minutes more and the troop passed over their heads	46.174623057287555
chapter lxii	2.29519940394875
as soon as the noise of the hoofs was lost in the distance dartagnan remounted t	21.169092344667455
this time said dartagnan when they were sufficiently distant to proceed at a tro	47.082248839327804
what do you say athos to that proposition is nt it reasonable	61.42494182854204
yes dear friend athos replied but you said a word the other day that was more th	59.56337675273323
you said let us die here i recall to you that word	125.17202933995372
oh said porthos death is nothing it is nt death that can disquiet us since we do	78.0824404792185
what troubles me is the idea of defeat	79.21114768717808
as things are turning out i foresee that we must give battle to london to the pr	90.60417051289313
we ought to witness this great tragedy even to its last scene said athos	192.25230786700646
whatever happens let us not leave england before the crisis	115.98229139602479
do nt you agree with me aramis	35.11237722052231
entirely my dear count	16.753869806846005
then too i confess i should not be sorry to come across mordaunt again	47.94883917940273
it appears to me that we have an account to settle with him and that it is not o	19.837523938615103
ah that s another thing said dartagnan and i should not mind waiting in london a	40.03433890110868
only let us lodge with some one on whom we can count for i imagine just now that	127.60589531225044
athos do you know any inn in the whole town where one can find white sheets roas	113.80414567389025
i think i know what you want replied athos	20.249711852899097
de winter took us to the house of a spaniard who he said had become naturalized 	56.131175112610535
what do you say to it aramis	16.799095802910067
why the idea of taking quarters with senor perez seems to me very reasonable and	102.77916573048552
we will invoke the remembrance of that poor de winter for whom he seemed to have	54.61007510269414
you forget aramis one precaution of considerable importance	283.69903286423124
what is that	6.482566810887546
the precaution of changing our clothes	322.81921376396775
changing our clothes exclaimed porthos	65.80739987900124
i do nt see why we are very comfortable in those we wear	70.76584902184565
to prevent recognition said dartagnan	133.2233946350239
our clothes have a cut which would proclaim the frenchman at first sight	173.28857148739436
now i do nt set sufficient store on the cut of my jerkin to risk being hung at t	77.0100158720231
i shall buy a chestnutcolored suit	152.99278133171458
i ve remarked that your puritans revel in that color	243.91050527262254
but can you find your man said aramis to athos	32.69095569608247
oh to be sure yes	61.252901223047694
he lives at the bedford tavern greenhall street	119.24877450492006
besides i can find my way about the city with my eyes shut	75.62288386590035
i wish we were already there said dartagnan and my advice is that we reach londo	56.91176004217095
come on then said athos for unless i am mistaken in my calculations we have only	45.9441785045932
the friends urged on their horses and arrived in fact at about five oclock in th	81.17183264178207
they were stopped and questioned at the gate by which they sought to enter the c	33.22122858897266
that reply led to several questions about the kings capture and athos gave detai	181.24956213585511
the way was therefore opened to the four friends with all sorts of puritan congr	32.945076092342426
athos was right	90.54197892045367
he went direct to the bedford tavern and the host who recognized him was delight	92.63737911213214
though it was scarcely daylight our four travelers found the town in a great bus	78.19951301521685
the plan of changing their clothes was unanimously adopted	218.03954740510318
the landlord sent out for every description of garment as if he wanted to fit up	160.4758712935672
athos chose a black coat which gave him the appearance of a respectable citizen	109.64997880370075
aramis not wishing to part with his sword selected a darkblue cloak of a militar	136.00998601636184
porthos was seduced by a winecolored doublet and seagreen breeches	70.61968711600755
dartagnan who had fixed on his color beforehand had only to select the shade and	103.3157389674943
now said dartagnan for the actual man	49.81706620677403
we must cut off our hair that the populace may not insult us	117.62990717997998
as we no longer wear the sword of the gentleman we may as well have the head of 	78.76918249861276
this as you know is the important point of distinction between the covenanter an	127.8284858604955
after some discussion this was agreed to and mousqueton played the role of barbe	80.90230852227852
we look hideous said athos	146.7837981039838
and smack of the puritan to a frightful extent said aramis	72.93947124802035
my head feels actually cold said porthos	356.273964092385
as for me i feel anxious to preach a sermon said dartagnan	38.75380508365857
now said athos that we can not even recognize one another and have therefore no 	75.3678671900882
they had not been long in the crowd before loud cries announced the kings arriva	72.66248688481885
a carriage had been sent to meet him and the gigantic porthos who stood a head a	70.03391106159489
dartagnan raised himself on tiptoe and as the carriage passed saw harrison at on	95.49791765568395
the next day athos leaning out of his window which looked upon the most populous	40.07625352604753
to the bar publicly cried	298.78099473979785
parliament indeed cried athos	78.82821148038494
parliament can never have passed such an act as that	126.15695397844932
at this moment the landlord came in	18.847785119961394
did parliament pass this act athos asked of him in english	186.82932925097668
yes my lord the pure parliament	65.39823446468952
what do you mean by the pure parliament are there then two parliaments	78.7608821598063
my friend dartagnan interrupted as i do nt understand english and we all underst	36.99209286958977
ah excellent said aramis	49.34752606744567
as to porthos all his attention was concentrated on the allurements of the break	56.5871731756865
you were asking then said the host in spanish	66.75774421047969
i asked said athos in the same language if there are two parliaments a pure and 	48.007520675151284
why how extraordinary said porthos slowly raising his head and looking at his fr	39.70381455286427
that is because we are talking spanish my dear friend said athos	22.000651851203592
oh the devil said porthos i am sorry for that it would have been one language mo	24.518024260969273
when i speak of the pure parliament resumed the host i mean the one which colone	85.5156971228506
ah really said dartagnan these people are very ingenious	40.91117977804706
when i go back to france i must suggest some such convenient course to cardinal 	113.311610635706
one of them will weed the parliament in the name of the court and the other in t	20.92868628889601
and who is this colonel bridge asked aramis and how does he go to work to weed t	51.35924295008913
colonel bridge replied the spaniard is a retired wagoner a man of much sense who	127.61897813785004
now of two hundred and fiftyone members who composed the parliament there were o	82.38714399066944
he took them up just as he formerly used to take up the stones from the road and	76.69262907417038
neat remarked dartagnan	111.48340776771855
and all these one hundred and ninetyone were royalists asked athos	126.45116013983203
without doubt senor and you understand that they would have saved the king	99.54409575924124
to be sure said porthos with majestic common sense they were in the majority	66.45373713664556
and you think said aramis he will consent to appear before such a tribunal	66.27715529069613
he will be forced to do so smiled the spaniard	36.65717683522448
now athos said dartagnan do you begin to believe that its a ruined cause and tha	73.17112700407071
the king will be delivered at the tribunal said athos the very silence of his su	31.021017687584887
dartagnan shrugged his shoulders	21.463069719501345
but said aramis if they dare to condemn their king it can only be to exile or im	84.59904300574156
dartagnan whistled a little air of incredulity	78.4774690719603
we shall see said athos for we shall go to the sittings i presume	21.747385048335723
you will not have long to wait said the landlord they begin tomorrow	89.85948267427294
so then they drew up the indictments before the king was taken	60.94376148929817
of course said dartagnan they began the day he was sold	44.88954607470742
and you know said aramis that it was our friend mordaunt who made if not the bar	47.14710825604444
and you know added dartagnan that whenever i catch him i will kill him this mord	49.8042403588507
and i too exclaimed porthos	30.81425240998666
and i too added aramis	28.404493804104362
touching unanimity cried dartagnan which well becomes good citizens like us	890.7698817032854
let us take a turn around the town and imbibe a little fog	41.956257133839706
yes said porthos twill be at least a little change from beer	96.63085073610635
chapter lxiii	2.255166573647133
the trial	1253.746543682898
the next morning king charles i	81.85435903951746
was haled by a strong guard before the high court which was to judge him	98.24644968083751
all london was crowding to the doors of the house	33.867066621841
the throng was terrific and it was not till after much pushing and some fighting	259.1854308032652
when they did so they found the three lower rows of benches already occupied but	96.5546230848487
toward eleven oclock the king entered the hall surrounded by guards but wearing 	130.68761889216043
the judges proud of having a monarch to humiliate evidently prepared to enjoy th	360.53446205019327
charles without replying a single word turned his head in another direction and 	103.17857840793539
then when the officer was gone he sat down in the armchair opposite the presiden	40.064407172213606
parry who accompanied him stood behind him	185.11041980443795
dartagnan was looking at athos whose face betrayed all those emotions which the 	113.5812223155417
this agitation in one so cold and calm as athos frightened him	223.75144436080024
i hope he whispered to him that you will follow his majestys example and not get	79.60380107208177
set your mind at rest replied athos	42.362983409165196
aha continued dartagnan it is clear that they are afraid of something or other f	48.07021635217381
they had only halberds before now they have muskets	175.74414852736146
the halberds were for the audience in the rear the muskets are for us	162.8880824901887
thirty forty fifty sixtyfive men said porthos counting the reinforcements	164.45552221558538
ah said aramis but you forget the officer	25.931213244975613
dartagnan grew pale with rage	73.54555191981832
he recognized mordaunt who with bare sword was marshalling the musketeers behind	294.5742634969572
do you think they have recognized us said dartagnan	25.010738605756
in that case i should beat a retreat	41.203620345323216
i do nt care to be shot in a box	76.65632376408237
no said aramis he has not seen us	18.525973446090827
he sees no one but the king	62.173927598377915
mon dieu how he stares at him the insolent dog does he hate his majesty as much 	93.63443333644997
pardi answered athos we only carried off his mother the king has spoiled him of 	93.39284064149986
true said aramis but silence the president is speaking to the king	43.03342742819751
stuart bradshaw was saying listen to the roll call of your judges and address to	187.67605579130154
the king turned his head away as if these words had not been intended for him	33.81139005140884
bradshaw waited and as there was no reply there was a moment of silence	61.18969926951185
out of the hundred and sixtythree members designated there were only seventythre	71.87260603276796
when the name of colonel fairfax was called one of those brief but solemn silenc	43.34168921170131
colonel fairfax repeated bradshaw	29.721147104092367
fairfax answered a laughing voice the silvery tone of which betrayed it as that 	86.54993172463669
a loud laugh followed these words pronounced with that boldness which women draw	258.8074000802089
it is a womans voice cried aramis faith i would give a good deal if she is young	49.12170222482311
and he mounted on the bench to try and get a sight of her	64.01092695704976
by my soul said aramis she is charming	42.11806923941063
look dartagnan everybody is looking at her and in spite of bradshaws gaze she ha	137.0947016372881
it is lady fairfax herself said dartagnan	59.9623067851614
do nt you remember porthos we saw her at general cromwells	67.04462920982061
the roll call continued	1877.4390817020692
these rascals will adjourn when they find that they are not in sufficient force 	117.77251903926451
you do nt know them	18.73529081394726
athos look at mordaunts smile	158.20149040681682
is that the look of a man whose victim is likely to escape him ah cursed basilis	57.35697579950067
the king is really very handsome said porthos and look too though he is a prison	57.782883595110924
the feather in his hat is worth at least fiveandtwenty pistoles	219.005163331883
look at it aramis	24.86159661796542
the roll call finished the president ordered them to read the act of accusation	247.4889390994767
athos turned pale	34.670589467223586
a second time he was disappointed in his expectation	41.83686965338115
notwithstanding the judges were so few the trial was to continue the king then w	91.06810625204479
i told you so athos said dartagnan shrugging his shoulders	22.840031562738993
now take your courage in both hands and hear what this gentleman in black is goi	106.9828920043215
never till then had a more brutal accusation or meaner insults tarnished kingly 	220.85044059391277
charles listened with marked attention passing over the insults noting the griev	210.984306185355
the fact is said dartagnan if men are punished for imprudence and triviality thi	97.466319186627
but it seems to me that that which he is just now undergoing is hard enough	40.65384354957333
in any case aramis replied the punishment should fall not on the king but on his	74.70536444683702
as for me thought porthos giving mordaunt his whole attention were it not for br	78.94497170358262
meantime dartagnan who is full of invention would find some way to save the king	74.18620076289903
i must speak to him about it	45.676055509217996
as to athos his face aflame his fists clinched his lips bitten till they bled he	90.71393046404303
at this moment the accuser concluded with these words the present accusation is 	71.42743241296458
at these words there was a murmur along the benches and a second voice not that 	70.9935125958038
you lie it cried	112.03122830192197
ninetenths of the english people are horrified at what you say	66.25465748181351
this voice was that of athos who standing up with outstretched hand and quite ou	60.809795892011834
king judges spectators all turned their eyes to the bench where the four friends	138.8399669319589
mordaunt did the same and recognized the gentleman around whom the three other f	120.8113769505901
his eyes glittered with delight	55.09252968918532
he had discovered those to whose death he had devoted his life	165.19139614598026
a movement of fury called to his side some twenty of his musketeers and pointing	154.29245047985552
but with the rapidity of thought dartagnan seized athos by the waist and followe	59.77674483912902
charles also had recognized the four frenchmen	110.12171416505534
he put one hand on his heart to still its beating and the other over his eyes th	74.54793752616965
mordaunt pale and trembling with anger rushed from the hall sword in hand follow	146.08296714090412
the tumult was indescribable	253.58604215323948
more than half an hour passed before any one could make himself heard	66.04307233801131
the judges were looking for a new outbreak from the benches	76.28843039044092
the spectators saw the muskets leveled at them and divided between fear and curi	161.31588908467677
quiet was at length restored	166.94745448608424
what have you to say in your defense asked bradshaw of the king	23.19050203395133
then rising with his head still covered in the tone of a judge rather than a pri	66.4480652963066
before questioning me he said reply to my question	140.38168362454903
i was free at newcastle and had there concluded a treaty with both houses	182.30460461611096
instead of performing your part of this contract as i performed mine you bought 	156.1460426920384
but because you have paid the price of a slave do you imagine that i have ceased	52.26009221309706
to answer you would be to forget it	68.23457575094677
i shall only reply to you when you have satisfied me of your right to question m	58.76242033209712
to answer you would be to acknowledge you as my judges and i only acknowledge yo	91.73226473840845
and in the middle of a deathlike silence charles calm lofty and with his head st	48.54459048984522
why are not my frenchmen here he murmured proudly and turning his eyes to the be	89.62104861417022
well said the president seeing that charles was determined to remain silent so b	70.78117035919936
we will judge you in spite of your silence	57.06061437224466
you are accused of treason of abuse of power and murder	150.03792562982647
the evidence will support it	464.67682459249716
go and another sitting will accomplish what you have postponed in this	223.5386930302336
charles rose and turned toward parry whom he saw pale and with his temples dewed	115.34736832997801
well my dear parry said he what is the matter and what can affect you in this ma	39.56546259884326
oh my king said parry with tears in his eyes and in a tone of supplication do no	31.05583533108732
and why parry	851.2521584604995
do not look i implore you my king	106.64744463551678
but what is the matter speak said charles attempting to look across the hedge of	32.06740059384468
it isbut you will not look will youit is because they have had the axe with whic	155.5679947003701
the sight is hideous	874.7796573326647
fools said charles do they take me for a coward like themselves you have done we	66.06625436379069
thank you parry	86.16602340569335
when the moment arrived the king followed his guards out of the hall	56.00402296210602
as he passed the table on which the axe was laid he stopped and turning with a s	38.93347831405309
ah the axe an ingenious device and well worthy of those who know not what a gent	103.11463903346797
and shrugging his shoulders with unaffected contempt he passed on	133.73040399891568
when he reached the door a stream of people who had been disappointed in not bei	35.62104215030015
how many people thought he and not one true friend	335.5231629985493
and as he uttered these words of doubt and depression within his mind a voice be	118.36371639341243
respect to fallen majesty	402.72456576937856
the king turned quickly around with tears in his eyes and heart	42.219773980942044
it was an old soldier of the guards who could not see his king pass captive befo	42.84929694657013
but the next moment the unfortunate man was nearly killed with heavy blows of sw	77.04630500180677
alas said charles that is a severe chastisement for a very trifling fault	39.96165350606644
he continued his walk but he had scarcely gone a hundred paces when a furious fe	57.26965927970583
loud roars of laughter and sullen murmurs arose together	150.78167068443847
the crowd opened and closed again undulating like a stormy sea and the king imag	94.61582209482165
charles wiped his face and said with a sad smile poor wretch for half a crown he	113.68585295064427
the king was not mistaken	30.212955905438125
athos and his friends again mingling with the throng were taking a last look at 	96.30815932090525
when the soldier saluted charles athoss heart bounded for joy and that unfortuna	118.96349721723685
but when the cowardly insulter spat in the face of the captive monarch athos gra	61.84716208718366
but dartagnan stopped his hand and in a hoarse voice cried wait	64.38337709791332
athos stopped	331.581311176837
dartagnan leaning on athos made a sign to porthos and aramis to keep near them a	40.36662348213926
the man took his way toward the city	37.28805694239696
the four friends followed him	36.48267610289729
the man who had the appearance of being a butcher descended a little steep and i	84.4112674599759
arrived at the bank of the river the three men perceived that they were followed	29.410084998074822
i do nt know english athos said dartagnan but you know it and will interpret for	25.34473171667781
then quickening their steps they passed the three men but turned back immediatel	201.59170173505424
say this to him in english you are a coward	42.46305222382601
you have insulted a defenseless man	59.234879185395755
you have befouled the face of your king	88.60219296312586
you must die	127.89707679980124
athos pale as a ghost repeated these words to the man who seeing the bodeful pre	60.40427699656936
aramis at this movement drew his sword	100.72512645856906
no cried dartagnan no steel	100.8048869634856
steel is for gentlemen	500.8750928355219
and seizing the butcher by the throat	177.31739562272585
porthos said he kill this fellow for me with a single blow	77.16576103130011
porthos raised his terrible fist which whistled through the air like a sling and	113.89578363335137
the man fell like an ox beneath the poleaxe	133.6420512687577
his companions horrorstruck could neither move nor cry out	279.28084378070565
tell them this athos resumed dartagnan thus shall all die who forget that a capt	110.90616067400398
athos repeated dartagnans words	154.3609615658176
the fellows looked at the body of their companion swimming in blood and then rec	79.71095278375059
justice is done said porthos wiping his forehead	29.71127075872754
and now said dartagnan to athos entertain no further doubts about me i undertake	94.5404176377103
chapter lxiv	2.565013322683604
the parliament condemned charles to death as might have been foreseen	189.63324459294208
political judgments are generally vain formalities for the same passions which g	218.5865914818519

meanwhile it was necessary at all hazards in order to gain time to put some obst	46.37480098086407
the only way of doing that was to cause the disappearance of the london executio	56.10623527402022
the headsman out of the way the sentence could not be executed	79.58611458574427
true they could send for the headsman of the nearest town but at least a day wou	65.50197329704588
dartagnan took upon himself that more than difficult task	248.818360900911
another thing not less essential was to warn charles stuart of the attempt to be	110.85915660274287
aramis assumed that perilous charge	1069.717240695109
charles stuart had asked that bishop juxon might be permitted to visit him	86.96801514864724
mordaunt had called on the bishop that very evening to apprise him of the religi	62.6054754317219

the palace of whitehall was guarded by three regiments of cavalry and by the fie	55.481936055863045
alone in his usual room lighted by two candles the condemned monarch gazed sadly	176.84833341967285

charles leaning on a table was gazing at a medallion of his wife and daughter he	55.29992799485827
at times he thought of those brave french gentlemen who had appeared to him from	114.60881216994859
in fact he sometimes asked himself if all that was happening to him was not a dr	51.81831479525224

he was thereupon constrained to admit that he was indeed awake and that his bloo	53.91888991864786
charles returned in silence to his chair rested his elbow on the table bowed his	55.86905956342132

he will speak to me of god and death as he has spoken to many another dying man 	95.59126847413503
and he raised the medallion to his lips	46.731169032213764
it was a dull foggy night	35.86051438071597
a neighboring church clock slowly struck the hour	728.2659475812595
the flickering light of the two candles showed fitful phantom shadows in the lof	84.47520934696236
these were the ancestors of charles standing back dimly in their tarnished frame	116.50132219130032
an awful sadness enveloped the heart of charles	71.34223295436698
he buried his brow in his hands and thought of the world so beautiful when one i	101.83501035745128

suddenly the door opened an ecclesiastic in episcopal robes entered followed by 	67.79389515259918
the guards retired the room resumed its obscurity	351.65392818548594
juxon cried charles juxon thank you my last friend you come at a fitting moment	62.92145408338454
the bishop looked anxiously at the man sobbing in the inglenook	67.54273093369142

if its parry said the bishop i have nothing to fear so allow me to salute your m	116.41075184313226
at this sight and this voice charles was about to cry out when aramis placed his	40.26726110365254

yes sire interrupted aramis raising his voice bishop juxon the faithful knight o	92.87887762765172

care not for me sire think only of yourself	327.17818554246935
you see your friends are wakeful	93.92357525912635
i know not what we shall do yet but four determined men can do much	128.73133106824153
meanwhile do not be surprised at anything that happens prepare yourself for ever	154.19838010248534
charles shook his head	10.893654832858378

something your majesty will happen between now and then to make the execution im	72.01287902251767
the king looked at aramis with astonishment	10.683556134577044
at this moment a strange noise like the unloading of a cart and followed by a cr	25.327014805064813
do you hear said the king	14.893762726148687
i hear said aramis but i understand neither the noise nor the cry of pain	75.02289767641365
i know not who can have uttered the cry said the king but the noise is easily un	51.56819918352404
do you know that i am to be beheaded outside this window well these boards you h	71.98918941243605
some workmen must have fallen underneath them and been hurt	305.28630988548196
aramis shuddered in spite of himself	31.907817661201584
you see said the king that it is useless for you to resist	24.706415819225608
i am condemned leave me to my death	121.3872633163211
my king said aramis they well may raise a scaffold but they can not make an exec	62.45874292588872
what do you mean asked the king	5.822347268713532
i mean that at this hour the headsman has been got out of the way by force or pe	49.329375444920885
the scaffold will be ready by tomorrow but the headsman will be wanting and they	78.42808892933739
what then said the king	28.26960219111203
tomorrow night we shall rescue you	211.931915132264
how can that be cried the king whose face was lighted up in spite of himself by 	46.30634477517719
oh sir cried parry may you and yours be blessed	257.98704596860244
how can it be repeated the king	29.505953492060975
i must know so that i may assist you if there is any chance	35.051452546538634
i know nothing about it continued aramis but the cleverest the bravest the most 	71.69615325741171
he has said it and will do it	51.57365837111649

dartagnan sire the same who had so nearly rescued you when colonel harrison made	214.4197746603783
you are indeed wonderful men said the king if such things had been related to me	44.352543057753586
now sire resumed aramis listen to me	55.19252576742999
do not forget for a single instant that we are watching over your safety observe	116.34160820640717

chevalier take my hand it is that of a friend who will love you to his last sigh	76.97946986237511
aramis stooped to kiss the kings hand but charles clasped his and pressed it to 	79.42722655785188
at this moment a man entered without even knocking at the door	34.51499941771799
aramis tried to withdraw his hand but the king still held it	53.46807410878936
the man was one of those puritans half preacher and half soldier who swarmed aro	53.94568694785285
what do you want sir said the king	8.118955921325838
i desire to know if the confession of charles stuart is at an end said the stran	25.87105338833861
and what is it to you replied the king we are not of the same religion	24.878970162508224

the king accompanied him to the door where aramis pronounced his benediction upo	44.3304373510387

he placed his hand on his dagger and stopped	28.62283010169757
the man came straight toward him	85.62990831939773
it was porthos	9.83617591467791

a handkerchief tied at the four corners is to be the signal	113.11440651518598
next moment dartagnan entered	65.56031271923162

the sum was collected in a minute	90.27551465873988
dartagnan ran out and returned directly after	129.30507191498796
there said he its done	340.535926106996
ough and not without a deal of trouble too	134.47914740885736
has the executioner left london asked athos	44.422749600808146
ah you see that plan was not sure enough he might go out by one gate and return 	101.23306591149685
where is he then	10.968386133089249
in the cellar	44.14987195659849

our landlords to be sure	66.16250259083539
mousqueton is propped against the door and heres the key	90.88577518884082
bravo said aramis how did you manage it	11.77951492476337
like everything else with money but it cost me dear	251.24227992606134
how much asked athos	17.26788370390453
five hundred pounds	34.33063692540322
and where did you get so much money said athos	35.30204038252538
had you then that sum	182.10303943438433
the queens famous diamond answered dartagnan with a sigh	163.46230490551497
ah true said aramis	5.287041805408063
i recognized it on your finger	116.06533341443158
you bought it back then from monsieur des essarts asked porthos	112.16929885866895
yes but it was fated that i should not keep it	29.3122775798208
so then we are all right as regards the executioner said athos but unfortunately	43.52977250542851
and this one had his said dartagnan but as good luck would have it just as i tho	81.6816722687313
in the excess of his zeal he had accompanied the cart containing the scaffolding	78.42004889466116
ah cried aramis that accounts for the cry i heard	159.45505329052443
probably said dartagnan but as he is a thoughtful young man he promised to send 	35.36073642787297
heres the letter he sent by a messenger for sixpence who sold it to me for a gui	47.357497225434045
and what on earth are you going to do with it asked athos	14.831350981745905
ca nt you guess my dear athos you who speak english like john bull himself are m	81.77212260785423
do you understand it now	21.015253022045204
athos uttered a cry of joy and admiration ran to a closet and drew forth workmen	40.69560145260242
the letter from the executioners assistant satisfied the master carpenter that t	243.83677867205526

the workmen	3433.1040191268003
toward midnight charles heard a great noise beneath his window	99.73223997936644
it arose from blows of hammer and hatchet clinking of pincers and cranching of s	116.5154332943155
lying dressed upon his bed the noise awoke him with a start and found a gloomy e	80.2452053048089
he could not endure it and sent parry to ask the sentinel to beg the workmen to 	78.00060888234373
the sentinel was unwilling to leave his post but allowed parry to pass	138.90022569511126
arriving at the window parry found an unfinished scaffold over which they were n	75.46658213881256
raised to the height of twenty feet so as to be on a level with the window it ha	66.30108339070797
parry odious as was this sight to him sought for those among some eight or ten w	178.7089653417092
my friends said parry mounting the scaffold and standing beside them would you w	161.77661270972317
one of the two who was standing up was of gigantic size and was driving a pick w	54.16116300031416
the face of the first was lost to parry in the darkness but as the second turned	52.8433253152733
very well very well said the workman aloud in excellent english	95.22885523994582
tell the king that if he sleeps badly tonight he will sleep better tomorrow nigh	98.92007402743349
these blunt words so terrible if taken literally were received by the other work	400.29367581277836
but parry withdrew thinking he was dreaming	469.61901007504525
charles was impatiently awaiting his return	161.42500052820475
at the moment he reentered the sentinel who guarded the door put his head throug	32.431735062279124
the king was lying on his bed resting on his elbow	25.786171302503853
parry closed the door and approaching the king his face radiant with joy	73.57501599190122
sire he said in a low voice do you know who these workmen are who are making so 	42.619085517983194
i no how would you have me know	209.3711640681509
parry bent his head and whispered to the king it is the comte de la fere and his	15.893604956723557
raising my scaffold cried the king astounded	125.93144923759684
yes and at the same time making a hole in the wall	20.91094513803211
the king clasped his hands and raised his eyes to heaven then leaping down from 	31.331984485845112
parry was not wrong	120.3490431373493
it was athos he had recognized and porthos who was boring a hole through the wal	34.39235039733388
this hole communicated with a kind of loftthe space between the floor of the kin	42.81928243826194
their plan was to pass through the hole they were making into this loft and cut 	84.69894336289946
through this the king was to escape the next night and hidden by the black cover	81.00143551992784
day gilded the tops of the houses	113.00000976416194
the aperture was finished and athos passed through it carrying the clothes desti	82.89204675484937
he had only two hours work to do to open communication with the king and accordi	60.77419877239871
dartagnan returned to change his workmans clothes for his chestnutcolored suit a	89.07770740366087
as for aramis he went off to the bishops palace to see if he could possibly pass	27.75271685915174
all three agreed to meet at noon in whitehall place to see how things went on	124.88901712130638
before leaving the scaffold aramis had approached the opening where athos was co	57.83967071467275
adieu then and be of good courage said athos	109.89604714682108
report to the king the condition of affairs	51.833006317371
say to him that when he is alone it will help us if he will knock on the floor f	55.94162193188646
try aramis to keep near the king	63.89257755763728
speak loud very loud for they will be listening at the door	108.41014454674286
if there is a sentinel within the apartment kill him without hesitation	254.9878499087143
if there are two let parry kill one and you the other	126.9960857679461
if there are three let yourself be slain but save the king	126.53264710686405
be easy said aramis i will take two poniards and give one to parry	53.80801172046411
is that all	62.008925101938885
yes go but urge the king strongly not to stand on false generosity	262.1007374110648
while you are fighting if there is a fight he must flee	120.3490431373493
the trap once replaced over his head you being on the trap dead or alive they wi	174.9934717025202
in those ten minutes we shall have gained the road and the king will be saved	38.08848968366298
everything shall be done as you say athos	32.20202082549792
your hand for perhaps we shall not see each other again	61.68714471279466
athos put his arm around aramiss neck and embraced him	66.26400957584006
for you he said	28.069314836462116
now if i die say to dartagnan that i love him as a son and embrace him for me	54.07537229791299
embrace also our good and brave porthos	397.35606332342843
adieu said aramis	5.055444369145922
i am as sure now that the king will be saved as i am sure that i clasp the most 	35.97754667903382
aramis parted from athos went down from the scaffold in his turn and took his wa	41.666063622902925
he found the other two friends sitting at table before a good fire drinking a bo	76.1359444324861
porthos was cursing the infamous parliamentarians dartagnan ate in silence revol	148.8612351832399
aramis related what had been agreed upon	211.61634714417806
dartagnan approved with a movement of the head and porthos with his voice	53.722946916784416
bravo he said besides we shall be there at the time of the flight	30.0758141620008
what with dartagnan grimaud and mousqueton we can manage to dispatch eight of th	72.7502690420687

mousqueton will lose another that s five and in five minutes we shall have gallo	89.82135574217871
aramis swallowed a hasty mouthful gulped a glass of wine and changed his clothes	88.01603689686532
now said he i m off to the bishops	49.380809744916355
take care of the executioner dartagnan	24.368613094534112
all right	103.68247493085516
grimaud has relieved mousqueton and has his foot on the cellar door	126.38997388675466
well do nt be inactive	39.03898627262485
inactive my dear fellow ask porthos	55.805292119952085
i pass my life upon my legs	93.91967893613388
aramis again presented himself at the bishops	140.78000039146804
juxon consented the more readily to take him with him as he would require an ass	93.66725564498846
dressed as aramis had been the night before the bishop got into his carriage and	41.87317330676398
the carriage stopped at the door of the palace	15.527432662670178
it was about nine oclock in the morning	7.708207580921243
nothing was changed	319.24589834099174
the anterooms were still full of soldiers the passages still lined by guards	160.84865410547255
the king was already sanguine but when he perceived aramis his hope turned to jo	62.061637954909074
he embraced juxon and pressed the hand of aramis	46.52102255194273
the bishop affected to speak in a loud voice before every one of their previous 	157.58224157168195
the king replied that the words spoken in that interview had borne their fruit a	130.0797664073744
juxon turned to those present and begged them to leave him and his assistant alo	73.00366904495479
every one withdrew	338.1052052725779
as soon as the door was closed	7.7838592242196105
sire said aramis speaking rapidly you are saved the london executioner has vanis	65.52637141793547
his assistant broke his leg last night beneath your majestys windowthe cry we he	566.2715072585493
but the comte de la fere asked the king	10.44007851921768
two feet below you take the poker from the fireplace and strike three times on t	147.5913389571709
he will answer you	48.25290447095883
the king did so and the moment after three muffled knocks answering the given si	339.6326685355245
so said charles he who knocks down there	135.13526314488337
is the comte de la fere sire said aramis	9.52463361320582
he is preparing a way for your majesty to escape	55.51371862995266
parry for his part will raise this slab of marble and a passage will be opened	134.63608781917233
oh juxon said the king seizing the bishops two hands in his own promise that you	38.69944032682599
sire replied juxon you shall be obeyed	24.513669711094828
meanwhile the miner underneath was heard working away incessantly when suddenly 	752.4000225829334
aramis seized the poker and gave the signal to stop the noise came nearer and ne	93.62434334690951
it was that of a number of men steadily approaching	39.9566804079971
the four men stood motionless	103.67407052986061
all eyes were fixed on the door which opened slowly and with a kind of solemnity	40.18322964770525
a parliamentary officer clothed in black and with a gravity that augured ill ent	102.33283321392734
what is this said aramis to juxon	12.538726125927653
juxon replied with a sign which meant that he knew no more than aramis about it	32.390617430920436
then it is for today asked the king	46.46267364440878
was not your majesty warned that it was to take place this morning	51.6492857100991
then i must die like a common criminal by the hand of the london executioner	53.06084964929602
the london executioner has disappeared your majesty but a man has offered his se	65.87647081161636
the execution will therefore only be delayed long enough for you to arrange your	164.64681769973492
a slight moisture on his brow was the only trace of emotion that charles evinced	74.07139254518054
but aramis was livid	102.20404383173477
his heart ceased beating he closed his eyes and leaned upon the table	86.19569344351989
charles perceived it and took his hand	53.21027456986835
come my friend said he courage	61.929349151626106
then he turned to the officer	19.665936645347387
sir i am ready	13.479028261874033
there is but little reason why i should delay you	117.69639298031068
firstly i wish to communicate secondly to embrace my children and bid them farew	112.80264869183569
will this be permitted me	149.18953613772624
certainly replied the officer and left the room	31.430258405265675
aramis dug his nails into his flesh and groaned aloud	91.76293255173402
oh my lord bishop he cried seizing juxons hands where is providence where is pro	66.64693159803667
my son replied the bishop with firmness you see him not because the passions of 	84.05095207346604
my son said the king to aramis do not take it so to heart	35.40463679310635
you ask what god is doing	211.2844234088491
god beholds your devotion and my martyrdom and believe me both will have their r	106.62446134648224
ascribe to men then what is happening and not to god	236.58344161057008
it is men who drive me to death it is men who make you weep	131.6095283727738
yes sire said aramis yes you are right	14.515605385703148
it is men whom i should hold responsible and i will hold them responsible	110.49237543007357
be seated juxon said the king falling upon his knees	45.281298287511476
i have now to confess to you	38.0464950477679
remain sir he added to aramis who had moved to leave the room	28.572028016802395
remain parry	1823.1052175485809
i have nothing to say that can not be said before all	36.20859709185296
juxon sat down and the king kneeling humbly before him began his confession	124.25509544288758
chapter lxvi	2.445891592904513
the mob had already assembled when the confession terminated	213.50532334375572
the kings children next arrivedthe princess charlotte a beautiful fairhaired chi	211.51919645569038
he had wept all night long but would not show his grief before the people	175.4820459747754
charless heart melted within him at the sight of those two children whom he had 	96.72148094704235
he turned to brush away a tear and then summoning up all his firmness drew his d	133.3376631173468
then he took the boy upon his knee	63.255463980837206
my son he said to him you saw a great number of people in the streets as you cam	36.48767788072203
these men are going to behead your father	36.14448629682259
do not forget that	18.858537025417842
perhaps some day they will want to make you king instead of the prince of wales 	93.7170692773257
but you are not the king my son and can never be so while they are alive	49.0949252647478
swear to me then never to let them put a crown upon your head unless you have a 	72.78288498084929
for one daylisten my sonone day if you do so they will doom you to destruction h	136.15572751105427
swear my son	45.95121147600542
the child stretched out his little hand toward that of his father and said i swe	80.23590771683706
henry said charles call me your father	36.461936917401225
father replied the child i swear to you that they shall kill me sooner than make	64.24408683359066
good my child	90.91585653994659
now kiss me and you too charlotte	130.478651250436
never forget me	180.41840840190974
oh never never cried both the children throwing their arms around their fathers 	381.1696140303095
farewell said charles farewell my children	92.59798522401702
take them away juxon their tears will deprive me of the courage to die	118.56973295110407
juxon led them away and this time the doors were left open	78.60139281381193
meanwhile athos in his concealment waited in vain the signal to recommence his w	87.37045189137716
two long hours he waited in terrible inaction	432.66713905802015
a deathlike silence reigned in the room above	55.128584148469045
at last he determined to discover the cause of this stillness	55.299347878569804
he crept from his hole and stood hidden by the black drapery beneath the scaffol	71.41953110311628
peeping out from the drapery he could see the rows of halberdiers and musketeers	57.58882359692878
what is the matter then he asked himself trembling more than the windswayed clot	31.79751862473909
the people are hurrying on the soldiers under arms and among the spectators i se	84.34492059056501
what is he waiting for what is he looking at good god have they allowed the head	123.5100838691718
suddenly the dull beating of muffled drums filled the square	173.8549350384064
the sound of heavy steps was heard above his head	103.56309749717167
the next moment the very planks of the scaffold creaked with the weight of an ad	46.64132069212834
at the same moment a wellknown voice above him pronounced these words	48.98798666932253
colonel i want to speak to the people	22.224278597273706
athos shuddered from head to foot	149.48462808475878
it was the king speaking on the scaffold	44.70215221321009
in fact after taking a few drops of wine and a piece of bread charles weary of w	41.98899020351274
then the two wings of the window facing the square had been thrown open and the 	62.05480228022614
he approached the block and laid his axe upon it	97.00669408765968
behind him pale indeed but marching with a firm step was charles stuart who adva	67.2446396148914
the sight of the masked man gave rise to a prolonged sensation	107.99825590568764
every one was full of curiosity as to who that unknown executioner could be who 	161.51647087889273
all gazed at him searchingly	159.3645223932805
but they could discern nothing but a man of middle height dressed in black appar	96.12308275249977
the kings request had undoubtedly been acceded to by an affirmative sign for in 	161.15189912759166
oh said athos to himself is it indeed possible that i hear what i hear and that 	30.908581064884885
a noise was heard like that the instrument of death would make if moved upon the	101.67445626186561
do not touch the axe said the king and resumed his speech	64.41534413369543
at the end of his speech the king looked tenderly around upon the people	43.02460475971398
then unfastening the diamond ornament which the queen had sent him he placed it 	93.74925000350969
then he drew from his breast a little cross set in diamonds which like the order	61.69844100051761
sir said he to the priest i shall keep this cross in my hand till the last momen	27.657302109423714
take it from me when i amdead	55.12319550358048
yes sire said a voice which athos recognized as that of aramis	37.26111170076891
he then took his hat from his head and threw it on the ground	19.042197149343938
one by one he undid the buttons of his doublet took it off and deposited it by t	62.85089593868267
then as it was cold he asked for his gown which was brought to him	54.03244418424084
all the preparations were made with a frightful calmness	100.87278114965284
one would have thought the king was going to bed and not to his coffin	42.54425322062427
will these be in your way he said to the executioner raising his long locks if s	73.61625042162105
charles accompanied these words with a look designed to penetrate the mask of th	40.351997419933426
his calm noble gaze forced the man to turn away his head	138.41307876310225
but after the searching look of the king he encountered the burning eyes of aram	69.40257385063647
the king seeing that he did not reply repeated his question	72.12322413265126
it will do replied the man in a tremulous voice if you separate them across the 	32.87362077616951
the king parted his hair with his hands and looking at the block he said	47.20496612826805
this block is very low is there no other to be had	183.2976887330134
it is the usual block answered the man in the mask	49.232993916762005
do you think you can behead me with a single blow asked the king	25.771531156730312
i hope so was the reply	79.79720415338768
there was something so strange in these three words that everybody except the ki	77.16910949464842
i do not wish to be taken by surprise added the king	30.95665810137741
i shall kneel down to pray do not strike then	157.9099715307052
when shall i strike	143.43381628641094
when i shall lay my head on the block and say remember then strike boldly	207.1812150598732
gentlemen said the king to those around him i leave you to brave the tempest i g	90.6485080822561
he looked at aramis and made a special sign to him with his head	23.171009283690278
now he continued withdraw a little and let me say my prayer i beseech you	79.42760529728483
you also stand aside he said to the masked man	126.53548290563069
it is only for a moment and i know that i belong to you but remember that you ar	23.018553480586053
then he knelt down made the sign of the cross and lowering his face to the plank	43.80809137241382
yes your majesty he answered trembling	258.559220272473
faithful friend noble heart said the king i should not have been rescued	72.2087365037658
i have addressed my people and i have spoken to god last of all i speak to you	69.5866531888945
to maintain a cause which i believed sacred i have lost the throne and my childr	124.69615904641154
a million in gold remains it is buried in the cellars of newcastle keep	96.36819979322465
you only know that this money exists	122.08238247947972
make use of it then whenever you think it will be most useful for my eldest sons	75.30317027689341
and now farewell	334.1989865562197
farewell saintly martyred majesty lisped athos chilled with terror	464.0634665163173
a moments silence ensued and then in a full sonorous voice the king exclaimed re	105.2057171648833
he had scarcely uttered the word when a heavy blow shook the scaffold and where 	61.72786812520554
he reeled back with a shudder and the same moment the drops became a crimson cat	141.9395047238404
athos fell on his knees and remained some minutes as if bewildered or stunned	64.92028133110283
at last he rose and taking his handkerchief steeped it in the blood of the marty	27.471771565707126
then as the crowd gradually dispersed he leaped down crept from behind the drape	111.93644676021613
having gained his room he raised his hand to his face and observing that his fin	28.26028230996409
chapter lxvii	2.579984088677459
the man in the mask	25.536510315975907
the snow was falling thick and icy	166.89675268708868
aramis was the next to come in and to discover athos almost insensible	97.7715363515905
but at the first words he uttered the comte roused himself from the kind of leth	55.139389311124596
well said aramis beaten by fate	102.9485820341564
beaten said athos	11.801677608630984
noble and unhappy king	377.3948217846243
are you wounded cried aramis	39.19481747824036
no this is his blood	129.50684908951214
where were you then	39.48050474086349
where you left meunder the scaffold	223.65138870188363
did you see it all	20.322245579277517
no but i heard all	40.8224563333356
god preserve me from another such hour as i have just passed	72.60409353960496
then you know that i did not leave him	14.295591600062213
i heard your voice up to the last moment	90.24203052202974
here is the order he gave me and the cross i took from his hand he desired they 	75.57418276317829
then here is a handkerchief to wrap them in replied athos drawing from his pocke	61.30505908903684
and what he continued has been done with the poor body	75.67616295175407
by order of cromwell royal honors will be accorded to it	84.73497676784056
the doctors are embalming the corpse and when it is ready it will be placed in a	49.67014711094079
mockery muttered athos savagely royal honors to one whom they have murdered	393.80442264103846
well cheer up said a loud voice from the staircase which porthos had just mounte	29.57447418383003
we are all mortal my poor friends	83.02195184996843
you are late my dear porthos	33.81141423520821
yes there were some people on the way who delayed me	75.12563849623986
the wretches were dancing	538.5143088050661
i took one of them by the throat and threequarters throttled him	72.52942129425148
just then a patrol rode up	168.5555642068905
luckily the man i had had most to do with was some minutes before he could speak	112.39732928768764
have you seen dartagnan	10.894714562280257
we got separated in the crowd and i could not find him again	61.274723230822836
oh said athos satirically i saw him	38.040980284779664
he was in the front row of the crowd admirably placed for seeing and as on the w	72.06732598536703
ah comte de la fere said a calm voice though hoarse with running is it your habi	58.77920677250702
this reproof stung athos to the heart but as the impression produced by seeing d	117.33759175008014
i am not calumniating you my friend	33.40043761530592
they were anxious about you here i simply told them where you were	165.22109487758877
you did nt know king charles to you he was only a foreigner and you were not obl	49.80671026538651
so saying he stretched out his hand but the other pretended not to see it and he	43.17043095396926
ugh i am tired cried dartagnan sitting down	57.01046372640175
drink a glass of port said aramis it will refresh you	39.23209280064626
yes let us drink said athos anxious to make it up by hobnobbing with dartagnan l	37.78832558258815
the felucca is waiting for us you know let us leave tonight we have nothing more	65.85891364850247
you are in a hurry sir count said dartagnan	15.528661784754695
but what would you have us to do here now that the king is dead	32.880393230896345
go sir count replied dartagnan carelessly you see nothing to keep you a little l	49.22867450000608
athos turned pale	33.87133832176638
every reproach his friend uttered struck deeply in his heart	197.28772582593348
ah you remain in london said porthos	26.39477149849281
and you	15.706300496026556
hang it said porthos a little perplexed between the two i suppose as i came with	57.564498740629965
i ca nt leave you alone in this abominable country	74.79450894829597
thanks my worthy friend	79.11326847794227
so i have a little adventure to propose to you when the count is gone	55.175395507874825
i want to find out who was the man in the mask who so obligingly offered to cut 	104.82824469271465
a man in a mask cried athos	24.754186519148725
you did not let the executioner escape then	108.84690568271573
the executioner is still in the cellar where i presume he has had an interview w	63.099384655679486
but you remind me	47.28492976595644
sir answered a voice from the depths of the earth	16.059202858375045
let out your prisoner	477.3184143727506
all is over	122.90337851736264
but said athos who is the wretch that has dared to raise his hand against his ki	36.95925443553664
an amateur headsman replied aramis who however does not handle the axe amiss	192.17183578076936
did you not see his face asked athos	22.72676945639938
he wore a mask	151.49897530096837
but you aramis who were close to him	101.05799124972792
i could see nothing but a gray beard under the fringe of the mask	72.76831009506905
then it must be a man of a certain age	24.252014572853863
oh said dartagnan that matters little	105.65208529446437
when one puts on a mask it is not difficult to wear a beard under it	83.6792456745376
i am sorry i did not follow him said porthos	23.059376831549603
well my dear porthos said dartagnan that s the very thing it came into my head t	23.271300193507823
athos understood all now	361.32321565992856
pardon me dartagnan he said	14.903602105648137
i have distrusted god i could the more easily distrust you	230.35254923246794
pardon me my friend	8.158995767955023
we will see about that presently said dartagnan with a slight smile	23.17557841219173
well then said aramis	4.896142111354766
well while i was watchingnot the king as monsieur le comte thinks for i know wha	69.89032735598676
now as we are wo nt to complete ourselves each by all the rest and to depend on 	68.22328642187908
i was looking around for porthos when i saw near me a head which had been broken	59.40683201890753
humph thought i that looks like my handiwork i fancy i must have mended that sku	156.33043065766432
and in fact it was that unfortunate scotchman parrys brother you know on whom gr	71.63197807777291
well this man was making signs to another at my left and turning around i recogn	132.89537041014958
oh said i to him	109.13607322593641
grimaud turned round with a jerk recognized me and pointed to the man in the mas	46.12786997747217
eh said he which meant do you see him parbleu i answered and we perfectly unders	106.99192176039399
well everything was finished as you know	172.2965514878785
the mob dispersed	1248.5924880100515
i made a sign to grimaud and the scotchman and we all three retired into a corne	40.8913644801238
i saw the executioner return into the kings room change his clothes put on a bla	102.20579829548284
five minutes later he came down the grand staircase	38.868193842329774
you followed him cried athos	55.87204337277941
i should think so but not without difficulty	185.2697229298888
every few minutes he turned around and thus obliged us to conceal ourselves	115.16199599686487
i might have gone up to him and killed him	68.71838033665541
but i am not selfish and i thought it might console you all a little to have a s	63.852283281093534
so we followed him through the lowest streets in the city and in half an hours t	89.36790488300086
grimaud drew out a pistol	48.30634892416635
eh said he showing it	32.69473606828133
i held back his arm	342.4789688003691
the man in the mask stopped before a low door and drew out a key but before he p	73.20264010127444
grimaud and i got behind a tree and the scotchman having nowhere to hide himself	122.10782439308855
next moment the door opened and the man disappeared	25.754289562730293
the scoundrel said aramis	236.03952537215494
while you have been returning hither he will have escaped and we shall never fin	89.2980453441024
come now aramis said dartagnan you must be taking me for some one else	37.13737166157062
nevertheless said athos in your absence	39.342227432311645
well in my absence have nt i put in my place grimaud and the scotchman before he	80.11571008882595
at one of the doors that by which he had entered i placed our scotchman making a	59.5312911024274
then going around the house i placed grimaud at the other exit and here i am	47.82172526034565
our game is beaten up	97.42719461758796
now for the tallyho	108.63229412479932
athos threw himself into dartagnans arms	65.31546136819313
friend he said you have been too good in pardoning me i was wrong a hundred time	45.35241270403011
i ought to have known you better by this time but we are all possessed of a mali	55.35981816954929
humph said porthos	9.253219387110988
do nt you think the executioner might be master cromwell who to make sure of thi	73.10887358007498
ah just so	270.209575789199
cromwell is stout and short and this man thin and lanky rather tall than otherwi	119.78670692477453
some condemned soldier perhaps suggested athos whom they have pardoned at the pr	220.33702167357853
no no continued dartagnan it was not the measured step of a foot soldier nor was	121.24420559968961
if i am not mistaken we have to do with a gentleman	24.99042487125386
a gentleman exclaimed athos	46.586097348033555
impossible it would be a dishonor to all the nobility	46.99143419540015
fine sport by jove cried porthos with a laugh that shook the windows	67.58725551620033
fine sport	720.2675538222736
are you still bent on departure athos asked dartagnan	88.0939244216957
no i remain replied athos with a threatening gesture that promised no good to wh	125.76066627793942
swords then cried aramis swords let us not lose a moment	65.91059345713693
the four friends resumed their own clothes girded on their swords ordered mousqu	53.77752623146912
the night was dark snow was falling the streets were silent and deserted	112.28670962281302
dartagnan led the way through the intricate windings and narrow alleys of the ci	53.9993338407124
for a moment dartagnan thought that parrys brother had disappeared but he was mi	35.547876192901484
the robust scotchman accustomed to the snows of his native hills had stretched h	142.83817703839176
he rose however as they approached	120.81932702696436
come said athos heres another good servant	135.51365350790653
really honest men are not so scarce as i thought	88.78519232221693
do nt be in a hurry to weave crowns for our scotchman	46.81879046079868
i believe the fellow is here on his own account for i have heard that these gent	48.785088732814856
i should not like to be groslow if he meets him	45.91878332543391
well said athos to the man in english	18.391951611604014
no one has come out he replied	43.38758373993497
then porthos and aramis will you remain with this man while we go around to grim	88.82461596170435
grimaud had made himself a kind of sentry box out of a hollow willow and as they	63.60422635090769
soho cried athos	19.239940152499273
yes said grimaud	3.9792837734989344
well has anybody come out	395.1159959105001
no but somebody has gone in	101.20492742907939
a man or a woman	36.81232896063149
a man	23.8065269232739
ah ah said dartagnan there are two of them then	18.86642505434035
i wish there were four said athos the two parties would then be equal	120.14864297121723
perhaps there are four said dartagnan	32.17939533065838
what do you mean	3.9793093894313274
other men may have entered before them and waited for them	83.6849118614332
we can find out said grimaud	19.365975108386827
at the same time he pointed to a window through the shutters of which a faint li	25.56291098605344
that is true said dartagnan let us call the others	19.519050992209465
they returned around the house to fetch porthos and aramis	41.264336260045866
have you seen anything they asked	23.1981886822612
no but we are going to replied dartagnan pointing to grimaud who had already cli	23.61734932036893
all four came up together	107.33607846454856
grimaud continued to climb like a cat and succeeded at last in catching hold of 	203.6020502434639
then resting his foot on a small ledge he made a sign to show all was right	82.1692423708375
well asked dartagnan	14.739022825050318
grimaud showed his closed hand with two fingers spread out	193.2728528396417
speak said athos we can not see your signs	23.713804531413118
how many are there	28.789942895536203
one opposite to me the other with his back to me	78.5413352260016
and the man opposite to you is	107.30424808646056
the man i saw go in	372.7539180017293
do you know him	9.613511213419615
i thought i recognized him and was not mistaken	60.811593693543095
short and stout	461.213722450613
who is it they all asked together in a low tone	43.54172995655814
general oliver cromwell	12.568212954981718
the four friends looked at one another	33.14405332541873
and the other asked athos	45.19157617915294
thin and lanky	18.444791871909125
the executioner said dartagnan and aramis at the same time	17.48035686246711
i can see nothing but his back resumed grimaud	92.27586819254381
but wait	1310.6305866681669
he is moving and if he has taken off his mask i shall be able to see	27.004971661097596
and as if struck in the heart he let go the hook and dropped with a groan	72.34994150832681
did you see him they all asked	59.03163588176162
yes said grimaud with his hair standing on end	40.608003879720044
the thin spare man	12177.15776688002
the executioner in short asked aramis	190.12016989541885
and who is it said porthos	13.951462680235823
heheis murmured grimaud pale as a ghost and seizing his masters hand	46.35987695364397
who he asked athos	63.33867683235083
mordaunt replied grimaud	26.222486292784303
dartagnan porthos and aramis uttered a cry of joy	12.418297620610005
athos stepped back and passed his hand across his brow	47.008074532986974
fatality he muttered	135.56943027039185
chapter lxviii	2.530060963429673
cromwells house	6826.592023194867
it was in fact mordaunt whom dartagnan had followed without knowing it	63.41970080299217
on entering the house he had taken off his mask and imitation beard then mountin	48.178964949340866
this man was cromwell	27.03095056696078
cromwell had two or three of these retreats in london unknown except to the most	56.84474241897023
mordaunt was among these	370.6972616333954
it is you mordaunt he said	26.947704180571446
you are late	341.9682000909595
general i wished to see the ceremony to the end which delayed me	38.83144017297513
ah i scarcely thought you were so curious as that	48.8902322569678
i am always curious to see the downfall of your honors enemies and he was not am	86.96631491243826
but you general were you not at whitehall	110.03117144181445
no said cromwell	4.473284519026522
there was a moments silence	6.964608781047627
have you had any account of it	53.59961429298878
i have been here since the morning	40.06836193638712
i only know that there was a conspiracy to rescue the king	45.7379527259462
ah you knew that said mordaunt	28.873090369701153
it matters little	1431.6753469959829
four men disguised as workmen were to get the king out of prison and take him to	72.88853597439856
and knowing all that your honor remained here far from the city tranquil and ina	124.48804536054553
tranquil yes replied cromwell	23.79934229502893
but who told you i was inactive	95.42399426589954
butif the plot had succeeded	382.0694571170557
i wished it to do so	26.51982561172129
i thought your excellence considered the death of charles i	78.0294392403528
as a misfortune necessary to the welfare of england	78.41844098663526
yes his death but it would have been more seemly not upon the scaffold	109.87325441509809
why so asked mordaunt	16.348283944982768
cromwell smiled	90.9084869886735
because it could have been said that i had had him condemned for the sake of jus	45.17248777748374
but if he had escaped	30.291314320115898
impossible my precautions were taken	270.6045193314124
and does your honor know the four men who undertook to rescue him	54.699257110445025
the four frenchmen of whom two were sent by the queen to her husband and two by 	96.99036695391212
and do you think mazarin commissioned them to act as they have done	48.401885737894744
it is possible	14.184738101002502
but he will not avow it	31.40792804653063
how so	18.52751060367906
because they failed	629.9596834121232
your honor gave me two of these frenchmen when they were only guilty of fighting	104.14010658092354
now that they are guilty of a conspiracy against england will your honor give me	56.485754623214184
take them said cromwell	10.85477343189188
mordaunt bowed with a smile of triumphant ferocity	32.28908668300487
did the people shout at all cromwell asked	74.23499856737426
very little except long live cromwell	852.0204841758721
where were you placed	75.65664337287576
mordaunt tried for a moment to read in the generals face if this was simply a us	107.42732324766966
but his piercing eyes could by no means penetrate the sombre depths of cromwells	92.90390377522179
i was so situated as to hear and see everything he answered	125.68069525891454
it was now cromwells turn to look fixedly at mordaunt and mordaunt to make himse	29.951025097852366
it appears said cromwell that this improvised executioner did his duty remarkabl	79.6959405856136
the blow so they tell me at least was struck with a masters hand	173.34419069071006
mordaunt remembered that cromwell had told him he had had no detailed account an	75.15605812216265
in fact said mordaunt with a calm voice and immovable countenance a single blow 	43.00582670768018
perhaps it was some one in that occupation said cromwell	39.68149023766629
do you think so sir he did not look like an executioner	29.67732373443221
and who else save an executioner would have wished to fill that horrible office	274.55808718192225
but said mordaunt it might have been some personal enemy of the king who had mad	50.80417395232642
perhaps it was some man of rank who had grave reasons for hating the fallen king	152.53190552787603
and if that were the case would your honor condemn his action	114.14642692657797
it is not for me to judge	17.213349966520568
it rests between his conscience and his god	310.43044349055845
but if your honor knew this man	59.38134284222072
i neither know nor wish to know him	165.53147813670398
provided charles is dead it is the axe not the man we must thank	95.16126574756733
and yet without the man the king would have been rescued	49.51187896036156
cromwell smiled	135.17438237746322
they would have carried him to greenwich he said and put him on board a felucca 	62.72727302242691
once out to sea you are too good a politician not to understand the rest mordaun	92.16588837741591
yes they would have all been blown up	68.31479349556378
just so	88.79374462201088
the explosion would have done what the axe had failed to do	84.81008212472862
men would have said that the king had escaped human justice and been overtaken b	150.07828167934082
you see now why i did not care to know your gentleman in the mask for really in 	102.04680061654847
mordaunt bowed humbly	433.9839637869822
sir he said you are a profound thinker and your plan was sublime	49.36875535470528
say absurd since it has become useless	431.12544241450325
the only sublime ideas in politics are those which bear fruit	497.30652232871967
so tonight mordaunt go to greenwich and ask for the captain of the felucca light	71.25227642718858
show him a white handkerchief knotted at the four corners and tell the crew to d	70.11112891576406
unless said mordaunt whose face was lighted by a savage joy as cromwell spoke	54.67208575211758
this skiff might be of use to you for personal projects	160.88401605356836
oh my lord my lord	7.813050144951836
that title said cromwell laughing is all very well here but take care a word lik	86.37392833916456
but your honor will soon be called so generally	81.7578527860096
i hope so at least said cromwell rising and putting on his cloak	26.54228112134305
you are going sir	23.256380023737783
yes said cromwell	3.9326630463229715
i slept here last night and the night before and you know it is not my custom to	52.00550076044548
then said mordaunt your honor gives me my liberty for tonight	51.942935482485964
and even for all day tomorrow if you want it	95.68795004722375
since last evening he added smiling you have done enough in my service and if yo	61.12420163386816
thank you sir it will be well employed i hope	31.863011037444917
cromwell turned as he was going	28.795379742197007
are you armed he asked	32.3280713867021
i have my sword	67.3701618316576
and no one waiting for you outside	305.62130882265757
then you had better come with me	62.93666758898097
thank you sir but the way by the subterranean passage would take too much time a	99.55045644983186
cromwell placed his hand on a hidden handle and opened a door so well concealed 	90.08300005709843
it closed after him with a spring	151.61604986598616
this door communicated with a subterranean passage leading under the street to a	77.33369419470053
it was just before this that grimaud had perceived the two men seated together	60.6814486133843
dartagnan was the first to recover from his surprise	48.18127384349752
mordaunt he cried	64.60929758897835
ah by heaven it is god himself who sent us here	142.2827285129541
yes said porthos let us break the door in and fall upon him	53.1580579496461
no replied dartagnan no noise	42.49459000527308
now grimaud you come here climb up to the window again and tell us if mordaunt i	54.20175093333684
if he comes out we shall catch him	60.47944195800355
if he stays in we will break in the window	77.5637706260097
it is easier and less noisy than the door	116.88732558385097
grimaud began to scale the wall again	65.898494549013
keep guard at the other door athos and aramis	29.84835849615405
porthos and i will stay here	57.013454122653556
the friends obeyed	409.6611336388244
he is alone said grimaud	17.644233424573407
we did not see his companion come out	54.46863941837907
he may have gone by the other door	77.72623197425946
what is he doing	10.873326968466777
putting on his cloak and gloves	32.007691658684294
he s ours muttered dartagnan	301.24356415884046
porthos mechanically drew his dagger from the scabbard	160.23432387235923
put it up again my friend said dartagnan	13.858028851860078
we must proceed in an orderly manner	116.30627535960062
hush said grimaud he is coming out	19.661600053233563
he has put out the lamp i can see nothing now	93.17861493559467
get down then and quickly	56.590815979958855
grimaud leaped down	322.819829493341
the snow deadened the noise of his fall	168.9759590484952
now go and tell athos and aramis to stand on each side of the door and clap thei	40.450884144407446
we will do the same	18.00185049476138
the next moment the door opened and mordaunt appeared on the threshold face to f	25.792246145457888
porthos clapped his hands and the other two came running around	57.85826269237516
mordaunt was livid but he uttered no cry nor called for assistance	164.70374708708795
dartagnan quietly pushed him in again and by the light of a lamp on the staircas	44.409131394061035
at last they stood face to face in the very room where ten minutes before mordau	85.80296361849737
porthos came up behind and unhooking the lamp on the staircase relit that in the	74.12283630999731
athos and aramis entered last and locked the door behind them	58.53416469813411
oblige me by taking a seat said dartagnan pushing a chair toward mordaunt who sa	53.49395837012254
aramis porthos and dartagnan drew their chairs near him	52.353199750315376
athos alone kept away and sat in the furthest corner of the room as if determine	66.655131273639
he seemed to be quite overcome	53.70134324010152
porthos rubbed his hands in feverish impatience	66.62719930522094
aramis bit his lips till the blood came	53.36510756102018
dartagnan alone was calm at least in appearance	154.69135966773575
monsieur mordaunt he said since after running after one another so long chance h	124.46584650340252
chapter lxix	2.4382054389305754
though mordaunt had been so completely taken by surprise and had mounted the sta	40.87637286546873
his eye wandered to a long stout sword on his flank and he instinctively slipped	129.5445860837241
dartagnan was waiting for a reply to his remark and said nothing	54.446034899814684
aramis muttered to himself we shall hear nothing but the usual commonplace thing	133.39928671444147
porthos sucked his mustache muttering a good deal of ceremony tonight about crus	190.6728877018984
athos shrunk into his corner pale and motionless as a basrelief	103.23418868825256
the silence however could not last forever	589.2097735835916
so dartagnan began	352.374186799893
sir he said with desperate politeness it seems to me that you change your costum	35.555225015081255
mordaunt did not reply	20.350532149231903
just now dartagnan continued you were disguisedi mean to say attiredas a murdere	91.39149799418482
and now i look very much like a man who is going to be murdered	33.23322247852188
oh sir said dartagnan how can you talk like that when you are in the company of 	22.85809049059937
no sword is excellent enough to be of use against four swords and daggers	122.77826218359887
well that is scarcely the question	73.94635945968676
i had the honor of asking you why you altered your costume	97.11976430961636
the mask and beard became you very well and as to the axe i do not think it woul	74.1669240360427
why then have you laid it aside	163.8030449344506
because remembering the scene at armentieres i thought i should find four axes f	97.35428456909348
sir replied dartagnan in the calmest manner possible you are very young i shall 	26.472358479538222
what took place at armentieres has no connection whatever with the present occas	177.425739210027
we could scarcely have requested your mother to take a sword and fight us	142.94671836407682
aha it is a duel then cried mordaunt as if disposed to reply at once to the prov	33.014222947609646
porthos rose always ready for this kind of adventure	317.3497634676389
pardon me said dartagnan	3.9629937449005173
do not let us do things in a hurry	24.561518631709948
we will arrange the matter rather better	247.6399223839999
confess monsieur mordaunt that you are anxious to kill some of us	29.881546488546046
all replied mordaunt	30.362332043478467
then my dear sir i am convinced that these gentlemen return your kind wishes and	99.09829648027022
of course they will do so as honorable gentlemen and the best proof i can furnis	66.35814106372322
so saying he threw his hat on the ground pushed back his chair to the wall and b	41.3939311394441
at your service sir he continued	27.725931901501696
my sword is shorter than yours its true but bah i think the arm will make up for	149.51884631669574
halt cried porthos coming forward	147.82440038492533
i begin and without any rhetoric	202.52483909034152
allow me porthos said aramis	7.749306602823904
athos did not move	16.050728104816194
he might have been taken for a statue	25.977449930331407
even his breathing seemed to be arrested	132.24867950456448
gentlemen said dartagnan you shall have your turn	23.993833040131157
monsieur mordaunt dislikes you sufficiently not to refuse you afterward	273.347923819418
you can see it in his eye	59.36214821869365
so pray keep your places like athos whose calmness is entirely laudable	313.10053403054627
besides we will have no words about it	84.37352099979184
i have particular business to settle with this gentleman and i shall and will be	77.78091876803725
porthos and aramis drew back disappointed and drawing his sword dartagnan turned	46.933703764995094
sir i am waiting for you	14.433458066767127
and for my part gentlemen i admire you	95.99670697634946
you are disputing which shall fight me first but you do not consult me who am mo	87.37036856846092
i hate you all but not equally	219.6385042162555
i hope to kill all four of you but i am more likely to kill the first than the s	51.67829367459788
i claim then the right to choose my opponent	272.76656389259006
if you refuse this right you may kill me but i shall not fight	39.21328709939559
it is but fair said porthos and aramis hoping he would choose one of them	50.41351214645715
athos and dartagnan said nothing but their silence seemed to imply consent	106.68650724834019
well then said mordaunt i choose for my adversary the man who not thinking himse	62.09319242648216
athos sprang up but after an instant of motionless silence he said to the astoni	47.11154471290466
submit this honour to somebody else	223.65181528346093
and he sat down	20.50271189889067
ah said mordaunt with a sneer there s one who is afraid	45.08073486477924
zounds exclaimed dartagnan bounding toward him who says that athos is afraid	77.37618653147796
let him have his say dartagnan said athos with a smile of sadness and contempt	27.643827227044337
is it your decision athos resumed the gascon	38.55389647850521
you hear sir said dartagnan turning to mordaunt	18.911189252460083
the comte de la fere will not do you the honor of fighting with you	19.74504407319651
choose one of us to replace the comte de la fere	17.464576961877015
as long as i do nt fight with him it is the same to me with whom i fight	32.41339916503755
put your names into a hat and draw lots	99.99528581834217
a good idea said dartagnan	23.250780497344454
at least that will conciliate us all said aramis	47.273589878539326
i should never have thought of that said porthos and yet it is very simple	26.688814294719045
come aramis said dartagnan write this for us in those neat little characters in 	113.14445349897328
mordaunt sustained this new attack without wincing	403.8986416598486
he stood with his arms folded apparently as calm as any man could be in such cir	47.91233960876439
if he had not courage he had what is very like it namely pride	147.02799300926122
aramis went to cromwells desk tore off three bits of paper of equal size wrote o	80.42770170942062
he then rolled them separately and put them in a hat which he handed to mordaunt	83.13715346645542
mordaunt put his hand into the hat took out one of the three papers and disdainf	26.450788246594062
ah serpent muttered dartagnan i would give my chance of a captaincy in the mousq	58.15821230301435
aramis opened the paper and in a voice trembling with hate and vengeance read da	81.76900330842535
the gascon uttered a cry of joy and turning to mordaunt	17.048625487191448
i hope sir said he you have no objection to make	19.760387344581652
none whatever replied the other drawing his sword and resting the point on his b	69.11466159640426
the moment that dartagnan saw that his wish was accomplished and his man would n	71.94176495971544
he turned up his cuffs neatly and rubbed the sole of his right boot on the floor	71.55509827484019
are you ready sir he said at last	29.661683649416013
i was waiting for you sir said mordaunt raising his head and casting at his oppo	21.52174677628587
well then said the gascon take care of yourself for i am not a bad hand at the r	23.23273259302854
nor i either	358.4472749892523
so much the better that sets my mind at rest	48.57150734204255
defend yourself	55.945970133041506
one minute said the young man	15.42251415102233
give me your word gentlemen that you will not attack me otherwise than one after	61.344681966479364
is it to have the pleasure of insulting us that you say that my little viper	52.269774356557846
no but to set my mind at rest as you observed just now	144.75626586988466
it is for something else than that i imagine muttered dartagnan shaking his head	63.371243210657866
on the honor of gentlemen said aramis and porthos	16.945564574952556
in that case gentlemen have the kindness to retire into the corners so as to giv	58.77993550788224
we shall require it	40.5025620444184
yes gentlemen said dartagnan we must not leave this person the slightest pretext	65.93212557825555
this new attack made no impression on mordaunt	57.05579864951858
the space was cleared the two lamps placed on cromwells desk in order that the c	65.42493368114548
dartagnan was too good a swordsman to trifle with his opponent	107.23749637569075
he made a rapid and brilliant feint which mordaunt parried	93.04883351209993
aha he cried with a smile of satisfaction	25.204508475576
and without losing a minute thinking he saw an opening he thrust his right in an	116.04148248772199
this time it was mordaunt who smiled	42.68417689866911
ah sir said dartagnan you have a wicked smile	24.320519534582896
it must have been the devil who taught it you was it not	60.16809446499871
mordaunt replied by trying his opponents weapon with an amount of strength which	166.18188573913864
mordaunt rapidly sprang back a step	408.99731509493
ah you lose ground you are turning well as you please i even gain something by i	272.71142180819436
you have no idea what a false look you have particularly when you are afraid	71.59137716643608
look at my eyes and you will see what no lookingglass has ever shown youa frank 	117.66637153257311
to this flow of words not perhaps in the best taste but characteristic of dartag	97.14102306936554
he smiled more and more sarcastically and his smile began to make the gascon anx	46.78237033323835
come come cried dartagnan we must finish with this and in his turn he pressed mo	55.270982344571756
however as they were fighting in a room and had not space to go on like that for	86.0446553117242
ah this time you can not lose ground my fine friend exclaimed dartagnan	88.42184755577205
gentlemen did you ever see a scorpion pinned to a wall no	148.26857792236808
well then you shall see it now	23.20321126419456
in a second dartagnan had made three terrible thrusts at mordaunt all of which t	66.3526355793514
the three friends looked on panting and astonished	77.97416872306695
at last dartagnan having got up too close stepped back to prepare a fourth thrus	114.50966580107291
dartagnan sprang back the wall had closed again	136.81382543898948
mordaunt in fact while defending himself had manoeuvred so as to reach the secre	119.14288717855813
the gascon uttered a furious imprecation which was answered by a wild laugh on t	66.70924899203837
help me gentlemen cried dartagnan we must break in this door	50.672172401312544
it is the devil in person said aramis hastening forward	53.8160431671874
he escapes us growled porthos pushing his huge shoulder against the hinges but i	119.29506935776487
sblood he escapes us	268.15179279876463
so much the better muttered athos	12.324945400225976
i thought as much said dartagnan wasting his strength in useless efforts	98.07102184169672
zounds i thought as much when the wretch kept moving around the room	132.1299257712059
i thought he was up to something	109.25598748710519
its a misfortune to which his friend the devil treats us said aramis	91.89771233008727
its a piece of good fortune sent from heaven said athos evidently much relieved	230.20793450326718
really said dartagnan abandoning the attempt to burst open the panel after sever	136.6381221763254
you can not understand the position we are in	38.81494567740398
in this kind of game not to kill is to let ones self be killed	200.66496887755073
this fox of a fellow will be sending us a hundred ironsided beasts who will pick	164.0553696952388
come come we must be off	43.8411507535335
if we stay here five minutes more there s an end of us	150.31670376237253
yes you are right	8.451338143823628
but where shall we go asked porthos	26.828991370222308
to the hotel to be sure to get our baggage and horses and from there if it pleas	65.40465874771242
so suiting the action to the word dartagnan thrust the remnant of his sword into	83.62204666276736

the skiff lightning	1048.5704393722133
dartagnan had judged correctly mordaunt felt that he had no time to lose and he 	40.48832111774343
he knew the rapidity of decision and action that characterized his enemies and r	124.1230394000948
this time the musketeers had an adversary who was worthy of them	75.20197960051378
after closing the door carefully behind him mordaunt glided into the subterranea	67.75010669184148

mordaunt proceeded at a rapid pace to the nearest cavalry barracks about a quart	56.112710003731536
he made that quarter of a league in four or five minutes	53.5176732248253
arrived at the barracks he made himself known took the best horse in the stables	102.91957410352664
a quarter of an hour later he was at greenwich	8.107232056267616
there is the port he murmured	92.43846134948586
that dark point yonder is the isle of dogs	306.9608862441181
good i am half an hour in advance of them an hour perhaps	51.290557746856
fool that i was i have almost killed myself by my needless haste	123.63730191506947
now he added rising in the stirrups and looking about him which i wonder is the 	49.11522617762578
at this moment as if in reply to his words a man lying on a coil of cables rose 	43.57010051725668
mordaunt drew a handkerchief from his pocket and tying a knot at each cornerthe 	40.501741244855545
he was wrapped in a large rough cape which concealed his form and partly his fac	68.88109937209342
do you wish to go on the water sir said the sailor	22.21567520514077
yes just so	380.47757153043636
along the isle of dogs	65.99443543894802
and perhaps you have a preference for one boat more than another	114.54805776745417
you would like one that sails as rapidly as	156.24167377061738
lightning interrupted mordaunt	71.81820344427017
then mine is the boat you want sir	131.87519259438824
i m your man	218.6803145268391
i begin to think so particularly if you have not forgotten a certain signal	120.75395606920318
here it is sir and the sailor took from his coat a handkerchief tied at each cor	68.8066142151631
good quite right cried mordaunt springing off his horse	84.0928847635346
there s not a moment to lose now take my horse to the nearest inn and conduct me	62.1199048946429
but asked the sailor where are your companions i thought there were four of you	97.35655928054697
listen to me sir	13.333139633638098
i m not the man you take me for you are in captain rogerss post are you not unde	45.261427391732425
mine also are from him	432.9337759891698
indeed sir i recognize you you are captain mordaunt	57.44549373069633
mordaunt was startled	243.015203731278
oh fear nothing said the skipper showing his face	155.33005711847514
i am a friend	29.30995047120746
captain groslow cried mordaunt	9.058038724677074
the general remembered that i had formerly been a naval officer and he gave me t	76.38201341681848
is there anything new in the wind	273.6795857080828
i thought perhaps that the kings death	134.31220638917642
has only hastened their flight in ten minutes they will perhaps be here	143.60059074320182
what have you come for then	38.015765874555676
to embark with you	215.73650306159726
ah ah the general doubted my fidelity	302.25608567639557
no but i wish to have a share in my revenge	27.2005501658573
have nt you some one who will relieve me of my horse	73.17367407039623
groslow whistled and a sailor appeared	118.47439093120632
patrick said groslow take this horse to the stables of the nearest inn	55.97764483459385
if any one asks you whose it is you can say that it belongs to an irish gentlema	51.94963574562337
the sailor departed without reply	905.0835568563784
now said mordaunt are you not afraid that they will recognize you	25.88218927662527
there is no danger dressed as i am in this pilot coat on a night as dark as this	99.29331533251356
besides even you did nt recognize me they will be much less likely to	66.13827759473425
that is true said mordaunt and they will be far from thinking of you	36.22906261473074
everything is ready is it not	53.59989543489147
the cargo on board	328.9894729106031
five full casks	2460.7743449364575
and fifty empty ones	2898.6450758136257
we are carrying port wine to anvers	156.37665486831142
now take me aboard and return to your post for they will soon be here	59.909434435689946
i am ready	23.75126797944107
it is important that none of your crew should see me	64.67967081078265
i have but one man on board and i am as sure of him as i am of myself	34.86281152138044
besides he does nt know you like his mates he is ready to obey our orders knowin	53.292100741006465
very well let us go	7.2243613429224744
they then went down to the thames	25.88058491970613
a boat was fastened to the shore by a chain fixed to a stake	88.75001801013659
groslow jumped in followed by mordaunt and in five minutes they were quite away 	109.16001431362714
when they reached the side of this felucca mordaunt dexterous in his eagerness f	70.35999973314583
he went with groslow to the captains berth a sort of temporary cabin of planks f	91.52066978308977
they will have nothing to do then at this end said mordaunt	27.17700641781582
nothing at all	39.668606713832745
that s a capital arrangement	118.2307615275374
return to greenwich and bring them here	38.23954215892825
i shall hide myself in your cabin	113.28605676640449
you have a longboat	50.96747222325778
that in which we came	78.10500670053491
it appeared light and well constructed	1274.4609301024882
quite a canoe	363.9298801605148
fasten it to the poop with a rope put the oars into it so that it may follow in 	72.9814282926209
put a good supply of rum and biscuit in it for the seamen should the night happe	68.40756497147002
consider all this done	159.94836366808636
do you wish to see the powderroom	17.618990187361856
when you return i will set the fuse myself but be careful to conceal your face s	114.47543517371693
never fear	2453.0035534942085
there s ten oclock striking at greenwich	64.27187785163622
groslow then having given the sailor on duty an order to be on the watch with mo	78.85877662771958
the wind was chilly and the jetty was deserted as he approached it but he had no	36.05315279580041
these horsemen were our friends or rather an avant garde composed of dartagnan a	82.77604012022633
as soon as they arrived at the spot where groslow stood they stopped as if guess	36.50881469811993
athos alighted and calmly opened the handkerchief tied at each corner whilst dar	164.85209145629588
on seeing the appointed signal groslow who had at first crept behind one of the 	71.22530480134931
he was so well wrapped up in his cloak that it would have been impossible to see	22.27702056699472
what do you want with us he asked of groslow	18.7596196142464
i wish to inform you my lord replied groslow with an irish accent feigned of cou	19.076200394359144
he fell down this morning and broke his leg	57.51055950590976
but i m his cousin he told me everything and desired me to watch instead of him 	105.05187032382385
and he drew out the handkerchief	37.22363229085322
was that all he said inquired athos	43.96445480511901
no my lord he said you had engaged to pay seventy pounds if i landed you safe an	89.38094569935112
what do you think of all this said athos in a low tone to dartagnan after explai	10.687115107346896
it seems a likely story to me	57.73460332196559
and to me too	322.00409607870944
besides we can but blow out his brains if he proves false said the gascon and yo	69.82037714376236
i dare say you know how to navigate should he fail us	281.94948518619793
my dear friend you guess well	38.31424693934443
my father meant me for the navy and i have some vague notions about navigation	144.36136033836615
you see cried dartagnan	27.407704385093055
they then summoned their friends who with blaisois mousqueton and grimaud prompt	129.62256539454555
thanks to this stroke of business the four friends were able to take away with t	56.00861637592518
parry parted from his friends regretfully they had proposed his going with them 	163.08400904768368
it is very simple mousqueton had said he is thinking of groslow	41.39890545575424
it was captain groslow the reader will remember who had broken parrys head	139.5849001563914
dartagnan resumed immediately the attitude of distrust that was habitual with hi	140.74992975085064
he found the wharf too completely deserted the night too dark the captain too ac	240.41923329905214
he had reported to aramis what had taken place and aramis not less distrustful t	55.24595051940472
a slight click of the tongue against his teeth informed athos of the gascons une	46.73814418112559
we have no time now for suspicions said athos	29.395763152853657
the boat is waiting for us come	64.22016615916462
besides said aramis what prevents our being distrustful and going aboard at the 	115.35996445537936
and if he does nt go straight i will crush him that s all	51.57016639172951
well said porthos replied dartagnan	19.8111359567816
let us go then	5.089538369504085
you first mousqueton and he stopped his friends directing the valets to go first	104.47459178855871
the three valets passed without accident	358.76823728160525
athos followed them then porthos then aramis	116.68122774461081
dartagnan went last still shaking his head	208.28269646697674
what in the devil is the matter with you my friend said porthos	25.469589461879337
upon my word you would make caesar afraid	66.37215996248115
the matter is replied dartagnan that i can see upon this pier neither inspector 	136.79047225850047
and you complain of that said porthos	50.87641671517904
everything goes as if in flowery paths	149.6614352510151
everything goes too well porthos	155.40058504545902
but no matter we must trust in god	162.85717232940183
as soon as the plank was withdrawn the captain took his place at the tiller and 	33.72021938135464
the other sailor had already seated himself on the port side and was ready to ro	82.51688737388999
as soon as there was room for rowing his companion rejoined him and the boat beg	178.49052228856988
at last we are off exclaimed porthos	50.40535155434183
alas said athos we depart alone	58.82305908633034
yes but all four together and without a scratch which is a consolation	75.88089817982004
we are not yet at our destination observed the prudent dartagnan beware of misad	61.443777989732126
ah my friend cried porthos like the crows you always bring bad omens	132.765779739065
who could intercept us on such a night as this pitch dark when one does not see 	220.58753358261495
yes but tomorrow morning	260.05919319554425
tomorrow we shall be at boulogne	17.2412262432176
i hope so with all my heart said the gascon and i confess my weakness	37.36794051514599
yes athos you may laugh but as long as we were within gunshot of the pier or of 	75.85286166588538
but said porthos with great wisdom that was impossible for they would have kille	51.528489927108176
bah much monsieur mordaunt would care	417.16768931733117
you do nt imagine he would consider a little thing like that	65.09914571976648
at any rate said porthos i am glad to hear dartagnan admit that he is afraid	19.563469874759214
i not only confess it but am proud of it returned the gascon i m not such a rhin	50.38461349181528
oho what s that	89.06012425707254
the lightning answered the captain our felucca	876.4823580067684
so far so good laughed athos	103.32101043379267
they went on board and the captain instantly conducted them to the berth prepare	96.57787650468222
stop a moment cried dartagnan pray how many men have you on board captain	93.00208018689723
i do nt understand was the reply	39.55720002986748
explain it athos	160.23539355544466
groslow on the question being interpreted answered three without counting myself	738.001407748318
dartagnan understood for while replying the captain had raised three fingers	228.65127987970266
oh he exclaimed i begin to be more at my ease however whilst you settle yourselv	81.70796697830401
as for me said porthos i will see to the supper	16.70572231232741
a very good idea porthos said the gascon	25.638003826639498
athos lend me grimaud who in the society of his friend parry has perhaps picked 	143.36714707639612
go grimaud said athos	9.700454008731345
dartagnan finding a lantern on the deck took it up and with a pistol in his hand	34.698457461004175
this was divided into three compartmentsone which was covered by the floor of th	48.67164147903229
oho cried dartagnan as he went down the steps of the hatchway preceded by the la	27.289567546194434
what is there in them he added putting his lantern on one of the casks	73.79433218648903
the captain seemed inclined to go upon deck again but controlling himself he ans	104.0172262422068
port wine	377.1692245732778
ah port wine tis a comfort said the gascon since we shall not die of thirst	105.74376415847787
are they all full	323.50925859609094
grimaud translated the question and groslow who was wiping the perspiration from	88.32648454995676
some full others empty	2106.5197429410487
dartagnan struck the barrels with his hand and having ascertained that he spoke 	53.259888503113
come along he said and he went toward the door of the second compartment	19.69961173259109
stop said the englishman i have the key of that door and he opened the door with	32.46948304232851
here there was evidently nothing to seek or to apprehend and they passed rapidly	169.0667903686438
this was the room appropriated to the sailors	61.88645661008046
two or three hammocks hung upon the ceiling a table and two benches composed the	40.39862684646876
dartagnan picked up two or three old sails hung on the walls and meeting nothing	74.21949585981594
and this room he asked pointing to the captains cabin	130.68861596336885
that s my room replied groslow	44.782883434175965
open the door	4.642855471552504
the captain obeyed	218.12835531787678
dartagnan stretched out his arm in which he held the lantern put his head in at 	55.55545261147582
good he said	23.983080767948564
if there is an army on board it is not here that it is hidden	45.18663094902293
let us see what porthos has found for supper	51.188233014771946
and thanking the captain he regained the state cabin where his friends were	155.8218993294971
porthos had found nothing and with him fatigue had prevailed over hunger	192.24204076022642
he had fallen asleep and was in a profound slumber when dartagnan returned	94.64095523356224
athos and aramis were beginning to close their eyes which they half opened when 	91.00537923556705
well said aramis	4.503888906672174
all is well we may sleep tranquilly	186.3215111047851
on this assurance the two friends fell asleep and dartagnan who was very weary b	70.81550354404659

port wine	402.638927695283
in ten minutes the masters slept not so the servantshungry and more thirsty than	120.13764353794355
blaisois and mousqueton set themselves to preparing their bed which consisted of	65.75827805996313
on a hanging table which swung to and fro with the rolling of the vessel were a 	84.04490042014868
this cursed rolling said blaisois	305.15168561011257
i know it will serve me as it did when we came over	50.8838528768341
and to think said mousqueton that we have nothing to fight seasickness with but 	69.41839445461812
but where is your wicker flask monsieur mousqueton have you lost it asked blaiso	66.07447711800027
no replied mousqueton parry kept it	115.94961094335007
those devilish scotchmen are always thirsty	228.99377951092288
and you grimaud he said to his companion who had just come in after his round wi	63.122677167319566
as thirsty as a scotchman was grimauds laconic reply	105.9438787076233
and he sat down and began to cast up the accounts of his party whose money he ma	65.43313901701872
oh lackadaisy i m beginning to feel queer cried blaisois	147.09832856312516
if that s the case said mousqueton with a learned air take some nourishment	50.11713208443144
do you call that nourishment said blaisois pointing to the barley bread and pot 	63.617966807793216
blaisois replied mousqueton remember that bread is the true nourishment of a fre	65.40989843601234
yes but beer asked blaisois sharply is that their true drink	766.9372863119198
as to that answered mousqueton puzzled how to get out of the difficulty i must c	104.64450740106562
what monsieur mousqueton the englishdo they dislike wine	225.48215578038233
they hate it	489.6259158990911
but i have seen them drink it	54.75084679955797
as a punishment	52.15379397148657
for example an english prince died one day because they had put him into a butt 	133.88021423345552
i heard the chevalier dherblay say so	111.40077549092412
the fool cried blaisois i wish i had been in his place	42.36293290858374
thou canst be said grimaud writing down his figures	202.8176618242488
how asked blaisois i can explain yourself	83.4097477886929
grimaud went on with his sum and cast up the whole	116.26940086900669
port he said extending his hand in the direction of the first compartment examin	20.907390737420304
eh eh ah those barrels i saw through the door	73.04242381750836
port replied grimaud beginning a fresh sum	150.42275082879996
i have heard said blaisois that port is a very good wine	47.36051199361167
excellent exclaimed mousqueton smacking his lips	63.216053802559095
excellent there is port wine in the cellar of monsieur le baron de bracieux	78.87415767065866
suppose we ask these englishmen to sell us a bottle said the honest blaisois	87.28346439572702
sell cried mousqueton about whom there was a remnant of his ancient marauding ch	81.23196492740067
one may well perceive young man that you are inexperienced	134.03357959484043
why buy what one can take	538.0274105014917
take said blaisois covet the goods of your neighbor that is forbidden it seems t	67.42778586308071
where forbidden asked mousqueton	265.9574552451246
in the commandments of god or of the church i do nt know which	47.469001798691544
i only know it says thou shalt not covet thy neighbors goods nor yet his wife	235.6705296163077
that is a childs reason monsieur blaisois said mousqueton in his most patronizin	25.30122572860664
yes you talk like a childi repeat the word	119.40439420342197
where have you read in the scriptures i ask you that the english are your neighb	33.62562257412824
where that is true said blaisois at least i ca nt now recall it	42.080941253500825
a childs reasoni repeat it continued mousqueton	263.4876657175079
if you had been ten years engaged in war as grimaud and i have been my dear blai	26.14164868429674
now an englishman is an enemy this port wine belongs to the english therefore it	91.80643630091947
and our masters asked blaisois stupefied by this harangue delivered with an air 	110.85392341151083
mousqueton smiled disdainfully	164.49363802482603
i suppose that you think it necessary that i should disturb the repose of these 	67.61529979277921
what does monsieur bracieux care think you whether i am thirsty or not	141.17298480177251
tis a very expensive wine said blaisois shaking his head	22.901550257491095
were it liquid gold monsieur blaisois our masters would not deny themselves this	271.70405474767904
know that monsieur de bracieux is rich enough to drink a tun of port wine even i	40.515996551546884
his manner became more and more lofty every instant then he arose and after fini	128.44762093940435
ah locked he exclaimed these devils of english how suspicious they are	191.64922208685445
locked said blaisois ah the deuce it is unlucky for my stomach is getting more a	96.47196914787567
locked repeated mousqueton	97.91341396218638
but blaisois ventured to say i have heard you relate monsieur mousqueton that on	99.72667607813929
perfectly true but there was an airhole in the cellar and the wine was in bottle	65.16582635870557
i can not throw the loop through this partition nor move with a packthread a cas	98.06657937111946
no but you can take out two or three boards of the partition answered blaisois a	45.32713928714548
mousqueton opened his great round eyes to the utmost astonished to find in blais	102.65456261616069
tis true he said but where can i get a chisel to take the planks out a gimlet to	53.184844580788535
trousers said grimaud still squaring his accounts	81.42462563201357
ah yes said mousqueton	5.665011014834636
grimaud in fact was not only the accountant but the armorer of the party and as 	51.73399023993383
mousqueton therefore was soon provided with tools and he began his task	234.10138250351287
in a few minutes he had extracted three boards	37.37507747484515
he tried to pass his body through the aperture but not being like the frog in th	61.10249150378938
he sighed and set to work again	120.75447429007444
grimaud had now finished his accounts	106.55498228890052
he arose and stood near mousqueton	85.67830734583026
i he said	119.29660524434205
what said mousqueton	14.679135273758021
i can pass	176.18969747275588
that is true said mousqueton glancing at his friends long and thin body you will	67.13186638956299
and he knows the full casks said blaisois for he has already been in the hold wi	73.54944470980733
let monsieur grimaud go in monsieur mouston	50.443810432567744
i could go in as well as grimaud said mousqueton a little piqued	54.38887088037649
yes but that would take too much time and i am thirsty	70.80503640401479
i am getting more and more seasick	217.47924988407323
go in then grimaud said mousqueton handing him the beer pot and gimlet	61.383569429249434
rinse the glasses said grimaud	166.44866872513234
then with a friendly gesture toward mousqueton that he might forgive him for fin	52.7412475189452
blaisois was in a state of great excitement he was in ecstasies	36.65099835129316
of all the exploits performed since their arrival in england by the extraordinar	115.80169649419027
you are about to see said mousqueton looking at blaisois with an expression of s	16.732014548999185
my cloak said grimaud from the bottom of the hold	48.80102617753018
what do you want asked blaisois	5.516202347002159
my cloakstop up the aperture with it	315.05855264363987
why asked blaisois	15.028462710493868
simpleton exclaimed mousqueton suppose any one came into the room	80.82106712350951
ah true cried blaisois with evident admiration but it will be dark in the cellar	37.05591358383626
grimaud always sees dark or light night as well as day answered mousqueton	448.7268353520545
that is lucky said blaisois	16.629087348366422
as for me when i have no candle i ca nt take two steps without knocking against 	59.24030254881364
that s because you have nt served said mousqueton	76.95869668958184
had you been in the army you would have been able to pick up a needle on the flo	24.2997583040387
but hark i think some one is coming	119.04969555288714
mousqueton made with a low whistling sound the sign of alarm well known to the l	84.40197012295832
blaisois obeyed	366.9400833378035
the door of their cabin was opened	41.93217645888829
two men wrapped in their cloaks appeared	58.10767883996374
oho said they not in bed at a quarter past eleven	99.13988850608148
that s against all rules	481.635192735832
in a quarter of an hour let every one be in bed and snoring	46.71947183854327
these two men then went toward the compartment in which grimaud was secreted ope	32.07742536388352
ah cried blaisois he is lost	25.67796840464921
grimauds a cunning fellow murmured mousqueton	127.38411755546755
they waited for ten minutes during which time no noise was heard that might indi	54.68723433566437
shall we obey asked blaisois	61.987787471325774
all this looks suspicious	511.5658667632426
they said a quarter of an hour	21.10954470976916
we still have five minutes replied mousqueton	109.22890024187046
suppose we warn the masters	328.6976591383005
lets wait for grimaud	119.41134065261693
but perhaps they have killed him	74.23567113253031
grimaud would have cried out	221.80766801158845
you know he is almost dumb	88.6831786876836
we should have heard the blow then	90.30883896907154
but if he does nt return	51.113317330139665
here he is	16.671015102796066
at that very moment grimaud drew back the cloak which hid the aperture and came 	51.66736604514735
he held in his hand a tankard full of a dark substance and approaching the gleam	72.11603676485373
both however cast an inquisitive glance into the tankardit was full of gunpowder	161.99058922480023
convinced that the ship was full of powder instead of having a cargo of wine gri	57.80349693446819
imposing silence grimaud put out the little night lamp then knelt down and poure	126.58466697038914
this was the gist of his strange story	63.979343665184125
the first barrel that grimaud had found on passing into the compartment he struc	61.773448996364074
he passed on to anotherit also was empty but the third which he tried was from t	161.29142993072645
at this point grimaud stopped and was preparing to make a hole with his gimlet w	38.76863752294591
whilst he was thinking that he should first taste the liquor which the tankard c	100.86099736486284
this was groslow	20.349353160759968
he was accompanied by another man who carried in his hand something long and fle	66.83201905938057
his face was hidden under the wide brim of his hat	55.40365556349991
grimaud thinking that they had come as he had to try the port wine effaced himse	150.33620105918192
have you the wick asked the one who carried the lantern	53.300538077931485
here it is answered the other	44.076975459314504
at the voice of this last speaker grimaud started and felt a shudder creeping th	73.04904169223272
he rose gently so that his head was just above the round of the barrel and under	112.68700895492657
how long will this fuse burn asked this person	462.47582971061115
about five minutes replied the captain	46.340206688159405
that voice also was known to grimaud	236.93375565434184
he looked from one to the other and after mordaunt he recognized groslow	61.66105937053266
then tell the men to be in readinessdont tell them why now	119.98421486588157
when the clock strikes a quarter after midnight collect your men	252.87735919594058
get down into the longboat	32.984671938356875
that is when i have lighted the match	88.06578459109814
i will undertake that	66.65900899092121
i wish to be sure of my revenge	21.660859572713026
are the oars in the boat	75.52972670589087
everything is ready	52.87509651419075
tis well	15.10775296716328
mordaunt knelt down and fastened one end of the train to the spigot in order tha	54.96199051480884
he then arose	184.855590484795
you hear meat a quarter past midnightin fact in twenty minutes	401.23541335346346
i understand all perfectly sir replied groslow but allow me to say there is grea	41.96778234670862
my dear groslow answered mordaunt you know the french proverb nothing one does n	37.98157498793134
i shall abide by that rule	185.43605999955554
grimaud had heard all this if he had not understood it	48.52513860790853
but what he saw made good what he lacked in perfect comprehension of the languag	137.63954446775494
he had seen the two mortal enemies of the musketeers had seen mordaunt adjust th	51.527187696532195
then he felt and felt again the contents of the tankard he held in his hand and 	40.252747819425494
mordaunt went away with the captain	64.03037292648801
at the door he stopped to listen	28.81236963704393
do you hear how they sleep he asked	68.32140654711823
in fact porthos could be heard snoring through the partition	74.678794941687
tis god who gives them into our hands answered groslow	114.36871445813918
this time the devil himself shall not save them rejoined mordaunt	123.53181774002584
and they went out together	48.724027908091344
chapter lxxii	2.661644229411044
end of the port wine mystery	36.37575887767845
grimaud waited till he heard the bolt grind in the lock and when he was satisfie	36.902251021931576
ah he said wiping with his sleeve large drops of sweat from his forehead how luc	54.49091553786713
he made haste to pass out by the opening still thinking himself in a dream but t	74.33953161176333
it may be imagined that dartagnan listened to these details with increasing inte	75.28130587571208
chevalier he said get up and do nt make the least noise	65.39605159954105
aramis awoke	6912.6036923751035
dartagnan pressing his hand repeated his call	230.43263698895217
aramis obeyed	417.7310159091183
athos is near you said dartagnan warn him as i have warned you	62.72042384731832
aramis easily aroused athos whose sleep was light like that of all persons of a 	278.0964050892595
but there was more difficulty in arousing porthos	82.07952691554091
he was beginning to ask full explanation of that breaking in on his sleep which 	124.72642773844012
then our gascon extending his arms drew to him the heads of his three friends ti	100.52480283460228
friends he said we must leave this craft at once or we are dead men	61.49551192076907
bah said athos are you still afraid	16.130903806651375
do you know who is captain of this vessel	53.96612798787785
captain groslow	6.230586784306659
the shudder of the three musketeers showed to dartagnan that his words began to 	85.24040668763239
groslow said aramis the devil	26.91420024510987
who is this groslow asked porthos	7.703952457575127
i do nt remember him	15.834065114598657
groslow is the man who broke parrys head and is now getting ready to break ours	156.75075285776938
oh oh	43.956520690392296
and do you know who is his lieutenant	36.10553027536012
his lieutenant there is none said athos	135.36659829379732
they do nt have lieutenants in a felucca manned by a crew of four	76.82930270150077
yes but monsieur groslow is not a captain of the ordinary kind he has a lieutena	38.02521138659994
this time the musketeers did more than shudderthey almost cried out	290.0907114521279
those invincible men were subject to a mysterious and fatal influence which that	246.46847541642558
what shall we do said athos	11.03248494038174
we must seize the felucca said aramis	46.970756843227136
and kill him said porthos	47.26484446751961
the felucca is mined said dartagnan	76.29075856410032
those casks which i took for casks of port wine are filled with powder	249.5813532984218
when mordaunt finds himself discovered he will destroy all friends and foes and 	145.54390736294772
you have some plan then asked athos	26.21404754823047
what is it	5.028411848922001
have you confidence in me	57.84526974681142
give your orders said the three musketeers	42.34152608527719
very well come this way	101.654192739002
dartagnan went toward a very small low window just large enough to let a man thr	122.10648521282863
he turned it gently on its hinges	85.70454001450332
there he said is our road	119.15771596954261
the deuce it is a very cold one my dear friend said aramis	30.02367154820259
stay here if you like but i warn you twill be rather too warm presently	148.84959449719457
but we can not swim to the shore	33.52500806872552
the longboat is yonder lashed to the felucca	225.51290810259613
we will take possession of it and cut the cable	56.556070481020086
come my friends	64.2001421263482
a moments delay said athos our servants	178.90370259795947
here we are they cried	92.01737561729377
meantime the three friends were standing motionless before the awful sight which	66.57860843607926
those who have once beheld such a spectacle know that there is nothing more sole	277.3042820914962
gracious heaven we are hesitating cried dartagnan if we hesitate what will the s	146.4424947279944
i do not hesitate you know said grimaud	17.640902022368063
sir interposed blaisois i warn you that i can only swim in rivers	25.90479659481374
and i not at all said mousqueton	31.91862963152317
but dartagnan had now slipped through the window	62.57935984036895
you have decided friend said athos	112.6621868800234
yes the gascon answered athos you who are a perfect being bid spirit triumph ove	145.09280903901907
do you aramis order the servants	210.7871116829598
porthos kill every one who stands in your way	181.39075161626357
and after pressing the hand of athos dartagnan chose a moment when the ship roll	69.3396581184633
athos followed him before the felucca rose again on the waves the cable which ti	93.74174017915412
dartagnan swam to it and held it suspending himself by this rope his head alone 	107.54833437944475
in one second athos joined him	115.88560385852281
then they saw as the felucca turned two other heads peeping those of aramis and 	107.74600681209441
i am uneasy about blaisois said athos he can he says only swim in rivers	135.53898611003095
when people can swim at all they can swim anywhere	229.86296125002383
to the boat to the boat	46.08773469502716
but porthos i do not see him	17.689758208931117
porthos is cominghe swims like leviathan	177.53922836229043
in fact porthos did not appear for a scene half tragedy and half comedy had been	61.40479382368335
come come said porthos jump in	25.7323289335284
but monsieur said mousqueton i ca nt swim let me stay here	45.85932007215411
and me too monsieur said blaisois	66.35621092812244
i assure you i shall be very much in the way in that little boat said mousqueton	45.56020218830392
and i know i shall drown before reaching it continued blaisois	159.08550028761783
come along i shall strangle you both if you do nt get out said porthos at last s	45.619995445455054
forward blaisois	34.45240873114773
a groan stifled by the grasp of porthos was all the reply of poor blaisois for t	48.789648404327686
now mousqueton he said i hope you do nt mean to desert your master	48.91989498003968
ah sir replied mousqueton his eyes filling with tears why did you reenter the ar	38.684413006977906
and without any other complaint passive and obedient either from true devotion t	246.75034468080554
a sublime action at all events for mousqueton looked upon himself as dead	198.29235256158984
but porthos was not a man to abandon an old servant and when mousqueton rose abo	29.951296452553756
in a few minutes porthos had rejoined his companions who were already in the boa	29.331376631491924
athos was the last to enter	44.59822088766222
are you all here he asked	26.92160630346486
ah have you your sword athos cried dartagnan	57.05038484772955
cut the cable then	45.89284415276857
athos drew a sharp poniard from his belt and cut the cord	59.872251687295275
the felucca went on the boat continued stationary rocked only by the swashing wa	130.03530074600786
come athos said dartagnan giving his hand to the count you are going to see some	12.745289139695267
chapter lxiii	2.4917227970647695
scarcely had dartagnan uttered these words when a ringing and sudden noise was h	63.525329306036646
that you may be sure said the gascon means something	57.31049974584489
they then at the same instant perceived a large lantern carried on a pole appear	64.26253112935044
suddenly a terrible cry a cry of despair was wafted through space and as if the 	37.580340560073594
shadows ran as if bewildered to and fro on the vessel and mournful cries accompa	124.84674255377963
in the midst of these screams they saw mordaunt upon the poop with a torch in ha	45.95800446404099
the agitated figures apparently wild with terror consisted of groslow who at the	166.243705759428
mordaunt after having listened at the door of the cabin to hear if the musketeer	36.84102253416694

all this while groslow and his men were assembled on deck	55.93460683519171
haul up the cable and draw the boat to us said groslow	30.054883200724795
one of the sailors got down the side of the ship seized the cable and drew it it	32.26675389049975
the cable is cut he cried no boat	438.8369373618308
how no boat exclaimed groslow it is impossible	64.49417792420243

mordaunt bounded with one step to the cabin and kicked open the door	54.54260781981728
empty he exclaimed the infernal demons	109.15043724838304
we must pursue them said groslow they ca nt be gone far and we will sink them pa	45.23648509279959
yes but the fire ejaculated mordaunt i have lighted it	77.207756122435
ten thousand devils cried groslow rushing to the hatchway perhaps there is still	67.62581133465571
mordaunt answered only by a terrible laugh threw his torch into the sea and plun	60.09629661737163
the instant groslow put his foot upon the hatchway steps the ship opened like th	77.79130433436816
a burst of flame rose toward the skies with an explosion like that of a hundred 	52.57370757785484

the four friends saw all thisnot a single detail of this fearful scene escaped t	80.10298978363456
at one moment bathed as they were in a flood of brilliant light which illumined 	73.932256655916
soon a torrent of vivid sparks fell around themthen at last the volcano was exti	86.78876125937406
they sat silent and dejected	217.75662256129132
by heaven at last said athos the first to speak by this time i think all must be	43.08728489751351
here my lords save me help cried a voice whose mournful accents reaching the fou	227.75854977066277
all looked around athos himself stared	527.1231066291741
tis he it is his voice	116.90449360032743
all still remained silent the eyes of all were turned in the direction where the	67.42749649503747
after a minute or two they were able to distinguish a man who approached them sw	43.286739712513324
athos extended his arm toward him pointing him out to his companions	83.23897905631762
yes yes i see him well enough said dartagnan	18.960068862035534
heagain cried porthos who was breathing like a blacksmiths bellows why he is mad	86.87558713280502
oh my god muttered athos	27.33131158619979
aramis and dartagnan whispered to each other	28.78183072293657
mordaunt made several strokes more and raising his arm in sign of distress above	240.9293521796699
the voice that implored aid was so piteous that it awakened pity in the heart of	186.79120383431507
poor fellow he exclaimed	25.885157599119292
indeed said dartagnan monsters have only to complain to gain your sympathy	113.42232055424641
i believe he s swimming toward us	325.9094764608083
does he think we are going to take him in row porthos row	51.83264793801016
and setting the example he plowed his oar into the sea two strokes took the bark	139.3124066033676
oh you will not abandon me you will not leave me to perish you will not be pitil	21.07834865735389
ah ah said porthos to mordaunt i think we have you now my hero and there are no 	32.00216712617006

oh pray for mercys sake do nt fly from me	34.125317205933804
for pitys sake cried the young man whose agonydrawn breath at times when his hea	32.745630431800244
dartagnan however who had consulted with aramis spoke to the poor wretch	102.1598510288885
go away he said your repentance is too recent to inspire confidence	119.52014514230656
see the vessel in which you wished to fry us is still smoking and the situation 	138.72462120373532
sir replied mordaunt in a tone of deep despair my penitence is sincere	19.81492916421184
gentlemen i am young scarcely twentythree years old	223.77662532630362
i was drawn on by a very natural resentment to avenge my mother	80.83235968932713
you would have done what i did	43.43994766349847
mordaunt wanted now only two or three fathoms to reach the boat for the approach	80.57529624565935
alas he said i am then to die you are going to kill the son as you killed the mo	37.396202306088405
then as if his strength failed him he seemed unable to sustain himself above the	95.17714882255305
oh this is torture to me cried athos	42.885722488314435
mordaunt reappeared	1603.110586662237
for my part said dartagnan i say this must come to an end murderer as you were o	46.10947442541632
dartagnan dartagnan cried athos my son i entreat you the wretch is dying and it 	43.587150431495424
i can not resist doing so he must live	166.41279784350178
zounds replied dartagnan why do nt you give yourself up directly feet and hands 	96.39591279616639
twas the first time dartagnan had ever refused a request from athos	49.72356083492062
aramis calmly drew his sword which he had carried between his teeth as he swam	93.86031360119176
if he lays his hand on the boats edge i will cut it off regicide that he is	39.16670914089949
and i said porthos	14.346825250086942
what are you going to do asked aramis	3.767070040034912
throw myself in the water and strangle him	94.37183225056961
oh gentlemen cried athos be men be christians see death is depicted on his face 	232.86991298541687
i will bless youi	134.66600810539492
i am dying cried mordaunt come to me come to me	55.703335879010325
dartagnan began to be touched	41.333073812999544
the boat at this moment turned around and the dying man was by that turn brought	129.41159820970944
monsieur the comte de la fere he cried i supplicate you pity me i call on youwhe	37.31836693883483

mordaunt made a last effortroseseized the hand thus extended to him and grasped 	137.17225457608313
that s right said athos put your other hand here	54.2284946044523
and he offered him his shoulder as another stay and support so that his head alm	114.89328864352795
now sir said the count you are safecalm yourself	23.33148272518812
ah my mother cried mordaunt with eyes on fire with a look of hate impossible to 	37.54032030860142
and whilst dartagnan uttered a cry porthos raised the oar and aramis sought a pl	62.36047799746639
for an instant without an exclamation without a cry for help athos tried to sust	57.9144887256091
mute with horror the three friends had remained openmouthed their eyes dilated t	101.49077802621078
porthos was the first who came to himself	50.662919056795644
he tore his hair	188.24168361967062
oh he cried athos athos thou man of noble heart woe is me i have let thee perish	224.90981102643104
at this instant in the midst of the silver circle illumined by the light of the 	17.73508332326332
in the bosom of this corpse was plunged a poniard the gold hilt of which shone i	105.57417796718238
mordaunt mordaunt cried the three friends tis mordaunt	59.053736572673486
but athos exclaimed dartagnan	31.418787862266498
suddenly the boat leaned on one side beneath a new and unexpected weight and gri	83.27149269257983
eight vigorous arms lifted him up immediately and laid him in the boat where dir	128.50379818539872
you are not hurt asked dartagnan	27.729805853207555
no replied athos and he	11.608514464021438
oh he now we may say at last thank heaven he is really dead	134.49838618123516
look and dartagnan obliging athos to look in the direction he pointed showed him	82.36216235890521
at last he sank	60.39563671344939
athos had followed him with a glance in which the deepest melancholy and pity we	63.613113327260635
bravo athos cried aramis with an emotion very rare in him	47.04515267590018
a capital blow you gave cried porthos	186.3721596488634
i have a son	38.34102133706527
i wished to live said athos	36.82622516722508
in short said dartagnan this has been the will of god	67.16221964755175
it was not i who killed him said athos in a soft low tone twas destiny	23.19923957310829

how mousqueton had a narrow escape of being eaten	52.47052428544634

the moon which had shone for a short time disappeared behind the clouds every ob	108.0815080689321
porthos was the first to speak	25.32673703876738
i have seen he said many dreadful things but nothing that ever agitated me so mu	93.27854943375384
nevertheless even in my present state of perturbation i protest that i feel happ	80.29140311999349
i have a hundred pounds weight less upon my chest	183.46759174648014
i breathe more freely	1075.4592754230123
in fact porthos breathed so loud as to do credit to the free play of his powerfu	68.0992919538855
for my part observed aramis i can not say the same as you do porthos	32.78641702900613
i am still terrified to such a degree that i scarcely believe my eyes	68.67072019250485
i look around the boat expecting every moment to see that poor wretch holding be	251.0325947781764
oh i feel easy replied porthos	83.17918554510278
the poniard was pointed at the sixth rib and buried up to the hilt in his body	73.894615346205
i do not reproach you athos for what you have done	23.500882494534434
on the contrary when one aims a blow that is the regulation way to strike	80.05002933312407
so now i breathe againi am happy	178.2231340578881
do nt be in haste to celebrate a victory porthos interposed dartagnan never have	89.0105364050053
men may subdue menthey can not overcome the elements	199.01178578164482
we are now on the sea at night without any pilot in a frail bark should a blast 	118.61955379350101
mousqueton heaved a deep sigh	78.01109817957281
you are ungrateful dartagnan said athos yes ungrateful to providence to whom we 	73.14070862742646
let us sail before the wind and unless it changes we shall be drifted either to 	73.35848535549789
should our bark be upset we are five of us good swimmers able enough to turn it 	187.7969074231421
now we are on the very road which all the vessels between dover and calais take 	43.53560550446344
but should we not find any fisherman and should the wind shift to the north	101.48932619936974
that said athos would be quite another thing and we should nevermore see land un	114.60728198743529
which implies that we may die of hunger said aramis	39.695523091453325
tis more than possible answered the comte de la fere	24.244059665728177
mousqueton sighed again more deeply than before	149.75302344741874
what is the matter what ails you asked porthos	9.064059543150666
i am cold sir said mousqueton	23.674131036866715
impossible your body is covered with a coating of fat which preserves it from th	69.20010450024972
ah sir tis this very coating of fat that makes me shiver	148.99829459808072
how is that mousqueton	20.850811215174353
alas your honor in the library of the chateau of bracieux there are a lot of boo	22.87350224995005

the fattest among them cried dartagnan unable in spite of the gravity of the occ	51.39725323655433
yes sir answered mousqueton but permit me to say i see nothing laughable in it	49.3346211474783
however he added turning to porthos i should not regret dying sir were i sure th	108.61401029385175
mouston replied porthos much affected should we ever see my castle of pierrefond	178.17758876923105
and you should call it devotion added aramis the vineyard of selfsacrifice to tr	132.575486810144
chevalier said dartagnan laughing you could eat a piece of mouston could nt you 	71.47635825033223
oh no replied aramis i should much prefer blaisois we have nt known him so long	60.45726895155305
one may readily conceive that during these jokes which were intended chiefly to 	127.13453267253111
suddenly mousqueton uttered a cry of delight taking from beneath one of the benc	39.67172788845495
oh sir he cried passing the bottle to porthos we are savedthe bark is supplied w	80.52102524058944
this intelligence restored every one save athos to gayety	447.9332825984032
zounds exclaimed porthos tis astonishing how empty violent agitation makes the s	491.4628072498792
and he drank off half a bottle at a draught and bit great mouthfuls of the bread	130.19084189464868
now said athos sleep or try to sleep my friends and i will watch	79.41969001868472
in a few moments notwithstanding their wet clothes the icy blast that blew and t	87.68874067813748
after some hours of repose the sleepers were aroused by athos	65.32689252429344
dawn was shedding its pallid placid glimmer on the purple ocean when at the dist	80.77117518741161
a bark all cried together	1440.9425000795316
it was in fact a small craft from dunkirk bound for boulogne	46.28109147345136
a quarter of an hour afterward the rowboat of this craft took them all aboard	53.24646825287657
grimaud tendered twenty guineas to the captain and at nine oclock in the morning	44.652354645327996
egad how strong one feels here said porthos almost burying his large feet in the	145.2024404947745
zounds i could defy a nation	330.0293075696594
be quiet porthos said dartagnan we are observed	22.701046225390584
we are admired ifaith answered porthos	110.09519974431072
these people who are looking at us are only merchants said athos and are looking	78.72907855307905
i shall not trust to that said the lieutenant and i shall make for the dunes as 	35.849238950529646
sandy hills about dunkirk from which it derives its name	239.6538510103973
the party followed him and soon disappeared with him behind the hillocks of sand	102.09177209170406
here after a short conference they proposed to separate	128.12988934265033
and why separate asked athos	99.37895515327769
because answered the gascon we were sent porthos and i by cardinal mazarin to fi	51.410354496271246
not the same thing by any means	30.642628565931044
in returning with the comte de la fere and monsieur dherblay our crime would be 	37.45387943590754
we have circumvented cromwell mordaunt and the sea but we shall find a certain d	44.70185379514499
you forget replied athos that we consider ourselves your prisoners and not free 	104.52267661036618
truly athos interrupted dartagnan i am vexed that such a man as you are should t	48.48333362603108
chevalier he continued addressing aramis who leaning proudly on his sword seemed	115.42373625215711
come athos and aramis go to the right porthos come with me to the left these gen	38.58734215475201
he then gave his friends minute directions as to their route	260.5416510484494
ah my dear friend exclaimed athos how i should admire the resources of your mind	31.908182819285383
and he gave him his hand	26.382981043316217
is nt this fox a genius athos asked the gascon	75.19541767184019
no he knows how to crunch fowls to dodge the huntsman and to find his way home b	131.80478244647657
well is all said	91.44956347672777
then lets count our money and divide it	355.85798969273753
ah hurrah there s the sun a merry morning to you sunshine	239.1784784182602
tis a long time since i saw thee	47.01967582859292
come come dartagnan said athos do not affect to be strongminded there are tears 	51.78280792496357
let us be open with each other and sincere	36.865405045433704
what cried the gascon do you think athos we can take leave calmly of two friends	69.1362184684931
no answered athos embrace me my son	70.42515093771875
zounds said porthos sobbing i believe i m crying but how foolish all this is	85.2762231541263
then they embraced	278.27760484747995
at that moment their fraternal bond of union was closer than ever and when they 	81.20965696555
at last they lost sight of each other	45.04949026684551
sacrebleu dartagnan said porthos i must out with it at once for i ca nt keep to 	38.2262154024005
why not said dartagnan with his wise smile	31.489836127995726
because if as you say athos and aramis are in real danger this is not the time t	48.40826772818315
for my part i confess to you that i was all ready to follow them and am still re	58.11554841653482
you would be right porthos but for one thing which may change the current of you	83.7783395117793
really said porthos opening his eyes in astonishment	31.134152816836448
yes no doubt	152.25293941264368
if they are arrested they will only be put in the bastile if we are arrested it 	49.04423307180547
oh oh said porthos there is quite a gap between that fate and the baronial coron	46.68260585753758
bah perhaps not so great as you think porthos you know the proverb all roads lea	110.31953975352206
but how is it that we are incurring greater risks than athos and aramis asked po	42.14908952006925
because they have but fulfilled the mission confided to them by queen henrietta 	164.8140497665081
we very nearly succeeded in saving it	360.28664405844637
upon my word that is true said porthos but how can you suppose my dear friend th	15.238995579355233
cromwell thinks of everything cromwell has time for everything and believe me de	162.94533614349126
we shall not be safe till we have seen mazarin and then	26.578401575106327
the devil said porthos what can we say to mazarin	26.96025480184144
leave that to mei have my plan	155.78237585349052
he laughs best who laughs last	2663.2257067015344
cromwell is mighty mazarin is tricky but i would rather have to do with them tha	49.90020543992156
ah said porthos it is very pleasant to be able to say the late monsieur mordaunt	22.01709171633794
my faith yes said dartagnan	43.66878308931931
but we must be going	37.27462632158438
the two immediately started across country toward the road to paris followed by 	161.16181220703203

that was still the situation of affairs up to the early days of february	71.834711714725
on the first day of that month our four companions had landed at boulogne and in	34.06942727004674

upon that athos yielded	378.32670219695973
on reaching the capital athos and aramis found it in arms	57.86176659760362
the sentinel at the gate refused even to let them pass and called his sergeant	132.6099445078347
the sergeant with the air of importance which such people assume when they are c	89.03851108717707
who are you gentlemen	31.529186351160863
two gentlemen	138.50603866841612
and where do you come from	26.48552754739491
from london	11.116808396022451
and what are you going to do in paris	7.072447210641873
we are going with a mission to her majesty the queen of england	21.159954010660364
ah every one seems to be going to see the queen of england	44.383632316991296
we have already at the station three gentlemen whose passports are under examina	97.12370076594598
where are your passports	48.38475200658329
we have none we left england ignorant of the state of politics here having left 	139.40091857976788
ah said the sergeant with a cunning smile you are mazarinists who are sent as sp	23.825673815373257
my dear friend here athos spoke rest assured if we were mazarinists we should co	95.8879619237387
in your situation distrust those who are well provided with every formality	274.92346456562035
enter the guardroom said the sergeant we will lay your case before the commandan	68.02766334455814
the guardroom was filled with citizens and common people some playing some drink	527.988718414929
in a corner almost hidden from view were three gentlemen who had preceded athos 	184.07635197038084
the first impulse of these three and of those who last entered was to cast an in	230.29873359879892
the first arrivals wore long cloaks in whose drapery they were carefully envelop	355.92604040990096
when the sergeant on entering the room announced that in all probability he was 	31.99924500359279
be it so said athos yet it is probable on the contrary that we shall enter becau	22.523327371260926
there seems to be only one thing to do which is to send our names to her majesty	48.26548040656986
on hearing these words the shortest of the other three men seemed more attentive	71.51873545910807
merciful goodness whispered aramis to athos did you see	95.85198471840583
what asked athos	21.461616485439443
the face of the shortest of those three gentlemen	97.07837171361578
he looked to mebut tis impossible	321.68580423709597
at this instant the sergeant who had been for his orders returned and pointing t	41.405706629154906
the passports are in order let these three gentlemen pass	280.533325097145
the three gentlemen bowed and hastened to take advantage of this permission	46.19587510033195
aramis looked after them and as the last of them passed close to him he pressed 	84.24796862810129
what is the matter with you my friend asked the latter	13.108592571937393
i havedoubtless i am dreaming tell me sir he said to the sergeant do you know th	36.563440689485155
only by their passports they are three frondists who are gone to rejoin the duc 	57.07435638044234
tis strange said aramis almost involuntarily i fancied that i recognized mazarin	50.39707212708044
the sergeant burst into a fit of laughter	57.244868709020096
he he cried he venture himself amongst us to be hung not so foolish as all that	166.9558134040647
ah muttered athos i may be mistaken i have nt the unerring eye of dartagnan	49.17316618912169
who is speaking of monsieur dartagnan asked an officer who appeared at that mome	41.4883574959719
what cried aramis and athos what planchet	52.15214021805739
planchet added grimaud planchet with a gorget indeed	103.6481200623951
ah gentlemen cried planchet so you are back again in paris	52.56581140523182
oh how happy you make us no doubt you come to join the princes	81.69803242663657
as thou seest planchet said aramis whilst athos smiled on seeing what important 	103.66981915120279
and monsieur dartagnan of whom you spoke just now monsieur dherblay may i ask if	79.71482981074277
we parted from him four days ago and we have reason to believe that he has reach	82.45835962834732
no sir i am sure he has nt yet arrived	42.64425203162194
but then he may have stopped at saint germain	42.56992361324012
i do nt think so we appointed to meet at la chevrette	53.61538607651969
i was there this very day	130.8707712975251
and had the pretty madeleine no news asked aramis smiling	156.5493709318503
no sir and it must be admitted that she seemed very anxious	57.818162233489794
in fact said aramis there is no time lost and we made our journey quickly	63.01910046316936
permit me then my dear athos without inquiring further about our friend to pay m	130.3053674462243
ah monsieur le chevalier said planchet bowing	22.885874059783305
lieutenant asked aramis	31.17369775109528
lieutenant with a promise of becoming captain	246.5004443786172
tis capital and pray how did you acquire all these honors	140.0747018817752
in the first place gentlemen you know that i was the means of monsieur de rochef	19.476009867641615
so owing to your popularity	216.80715963174148
no thanks to something better	489.15359687307875
you know gentlemen that i served the piedmont regiment and had the honor of bein	32.826589171719085
well one day when no one could drill a mob of citizens who began to march some w	96.96567333967786
so i presume said athos that you have a large number of the nobles with you	33.43142119211406
there are the prince de conti the duc de longueville the duc de beaufort the duc	9.666313010129679
and the vicomte raoul de bragelonne inquired athos in a tremulous voice	25.743871579405045
dartagnan told me that he had recommended him to your care in parting	64.3294897828696
yes count nor have i lost sight of him for a single instant since	78.4309311852939
then said athos in a tone of delight he is well no accident has happened to him	27.7658343831217
none sir	139.25601951493903
and he lives	120.65967689661699
still at the hotel of the great charlemagne	20.916345194296298
and passes his time	524.8360048780455
sometimes with the queen of england sometimes with madame de chevreuse	36.52867478806715
he and the count de guiche are like each others shadows	106.45965575822376
thanks planchet thanks cried athos extending his hand to the lieutenant	33.322488523075116
oh sir planchet only touched the tips of the counts fingers	143.08174346296053
well what are you doing countto a former lackey	69.39880126840121
my friend said athos he has given me news of raoul	17.523929594724894
and now gentlemen said planchet who had not heard what they were saying what do 	32.61659864161665
reenter paris if you will let us my good planchet	30.298443284835685
let you sir now as ever i am nothing but your servant	220.52916400193348
then turning to his men	49.347126046587405
allow these gentlemen to pass he said they are friends of the duc de beaufort	27.222608501320806
long live the duc de beaufort cried the sentinels	36.28586530403217
the sergeant drew near to planchet	99.86786682397282
what without passports he murmured	940.4641763820769
without passports said planchet	46.397649572545554
take notice captain he continued giving planchet his expected title take notice 	501.3274132241146
and i said planchet with dignity i know them and i answer for them	53.635701959303894
as he said this he pressed grimauds hand who seemed honored by the distinction	109.15064543651884
farewell till we meet again said aramis as they took leave of planchet if anythi	35.53845293727555
sir said planchet i am in all things at your service	17.54974374888768
that fellow is no fool said aramis as he got on his horse	60.52765087214551
how should he be replied athos whilst mounting also seeing he was used so long t	120.73541674113059
chapter lxxvi	2.569984811912809
the ambassadors	4139.2581744349345
the two friends rode rapidly down the declivity of the faubourg but on arriving 	54.50640378141768
the two gentlemen were obliged therefore to get off their horses and take a boat	50.66250837310026
night had closed in and paris seen thus by the light of lanterns flickering on t	80.30698700341611
they reached the queens apartments but were compelled to stop in the antechamber	60.51209634310091
we too said athos to the footman who had given him that answer not only bring ne	78.51171673324882
what then are your names gentlemen	106.07596445498716
the comte de la fere and the chevalier dherblay said aramis	10.162981074738907
ah in that case gentlemen said the footman on hearing the names which the queen 	58.34014084057145
please follow me and he went on before followed by athos and aramis	67.88485865895325
on arriving at the door of the room where the queen was receiving he made a sign	18.411242491527272
madame he said i hope your majesty will forgive me for disobeying your orders wh	36.273011861561116
on hearing those two names the queen uttered a cry of joy which the two gentleme	37.27312445501968
poor queen murmured athos	16.327638997864813
oh let them come in let them come in cried the young princess bounding to the do	76.69178797119072
the poor child was constant in her attendance on her mother and sought by her fi	74.22261029914606
come in gentlemen repeated the princess opening the door herself	155.73335690256994
the queen was seated on a fauteuil and before her were standing two or three gen	48.81468766311882
all these gentlemen had been noticed by athos and aramis in the guardhouse and w	21.576715395244392
well sirs cried the queen on perceiving the two friends you have come faithful f	38.14126868655213
aramis and athos were astounded by the calmness even the gayety of the queens ma	66.52132947558913
go on with your recital sirs said the queen turning to the duc de chatillon	21.028605038745546
you said that his majesty king charles my august consort had been condemned to d	102.34420333623301
yes madame chatillon stammered out	118.35541997211548
athos and aramis were more and more astonished	56.459122676274006
and that being conducted to the scaffold resumed the queenoh my lord oh my kinga	124.85156470374429
just so madame replied chatillon in so low a voice that though the two friends w	27.392548523297396
the queen clasped her hands in enthusiastic gratitude whilst her daughter threw 	170.29451395906705
now madame nothing remains to me except to proffer my respectful homage said cha	153.76745037506882
one moment yes answered the queen	66.90213352284898
one momenti begfor here are the chevalier dherblay and the comte de la fere just	34.81061008666455
speak gentlemen speaki am listening conceal nothing gloss over nothing	551.5595784413958
since his majesty still lives since the honor of the throne is safe everything e	175.82570614990493
athos turned pale and laid his hand on his heart	16.852357317812615
well exclaimed the queen who remarked this movement and his paleness	84.15445866486185
speak sir i beg you to do so	12.60774483481939
i beg you to excuse me madame i wish to add nothing to the recital of these gent	34.05954327539922
mistaken cried the queen almost suffocated by emotion mistaken what has happened	76.3178651885844
sir interposed monsieur de flamarens to athos if we are mistaken the error has o	36.04685266783277
i do not suppose you will have the presumption to set it to rightsthat would be 	33.993093755673655
with the queen sir replied athos in his calm vibrating voice	29.78285992647665
yes murmured flamarens lowering his eyes	42.942374331275
athos sighed deeply	118.16425559166788
or rather sir said aramis with his peculiar irritating politeness the error of t	29.144696800159338
chatillon and flamarens started	29.66591294499203
explain yourself count cried the queen whose anxiety grew greater every moment	234.63837112686707
on your brow i read despairyour lips falter ere you announce some terrible tidin	250.3564742929368
oh my god my god what has happened	30.70758718751517
lord ejaculated the young princess falling on her knees have mercy on us	95.17406276050639
sir said chatillon if you bring bad tidings it will be cruel in you to announce 	45.48003226761015
aramis went so close to chatillon as almost to touch him	143.51954029332563
sir said he with compressed lips and flashing eyes you have not the presumption 	84.59888164602644
during this brief altercation athos with his hands on his heart his head bent lo	51.07795255392999
madame princeswho by nature are above other menreceive from heaven courage to su	607.4679238821358
we ought not therefore i think to act toward a queen so illustrious as your maje	116.7961766851722
queen destined as you are to endure every sorrow on this earth hear the result o	268.29900550755997
athos kneeling down before the queen trembling and very cold drew from his bosom	144.16462109890736
before his death had placed in the hands of aramis	33.049024128189764
since the moment he had first received these two mementoes athos had never parte	51.287561821991325
he opened the case and offered them to the queen with deep and silent anguish	83.33111414638715
the queen stretched out her hand seized the ring pressed it convulsively to her 	68.92854398200753
athos kissed the hem of the robe of the widowed queen and rising with a dignity 	69.21264456518087
i the comte de la fere a gentleman who has never deceived any human being swear 	82.57774044582999
now chevalier he added turning to aramis let us go	45.83598253309696
our duty is fulfilled	173.77379439625554
not yet	162.89064565633703
said aramis we have still a word to say to these gentlemen	27.155010930503153
and turning to chatillon sir be so good as not to go away without giving me an o	44.80737265242172
chatillon bowed in token of assent and they all went out stopping at the window 	49.159627068507774
sir said aramis you allowed yourself just now to treat us in a most extraordinar	67.87265625708025
that would not be endurable in any case and is still less so on the part of thos	47.20656430013632
sir cried de chatillon	22.390881135206968
what have you done with monsieur de bruy has he by any possibility gone to chang	32.84008477722289
chevalier chevalier said athos	41.459068933808275
leave me alone said aramis impatiently	31.61528478528303
you know well that i do nt like to leave things half finished	99.05270710117844
conclude then sir answered de chatillon with as much hauteur as aramis	56.84617903845154
gentlemen resumed aramis any one but the comte de la fere and myself would have 	40.669112310966796
come and converse with us for just five minutes sword in hand upon this deserted	283.7079613686068
one moment gentlemen cried flamarens	72.83614282260102
i know well that the proposition is tempting but at present it is impossible to 	40.71858366672444
and why not said aramis in his tone of raillery	31.753873777576107
is it mazarins proximity that makes you so prudent	98.41665357797778
oh you hear that flamarens said chatillon	23.629216427752876
not to reply would be a blot on my name and my honor	72.11638064173391
that is my opinion said aramis	7.994546887993764
you will not reply however and these gentlemen i am sure will presently be of my	110.26006015417758
aramis shook his head with a motion of indescribable insolence	24.7745149585766
chatillon saw the motion and put his hand to his sword	20.84860908066361
willingly replied de chatillon	24.03744625388894
duke said flamarens you forget that tomorrow you are to command an expedition of	42.54621093036327
until tomorrow evening you are not at your own disposal	48.12501888669102
let it be then the day after tomorrow said aramis	17.02721792217684
tomorrow rather said de chatillon if you will take the trouble of coming so far 	44.4761295657017
how can you doubt it sir for the pleasure of a meeting with you i would go to th	29.375172397806338
very well tomorrow sir	156.41334574231448
i shall rely on it	58.70618288787634
are you going to rejoin your cardinal swear first on your honor not to inform hi	85.5369446113219
why not	50.64611997976067
because it is for victors to make conditions and you are not yet victors gentlem	67.00359310178662
then let us draw on the spot	30.42564461691576
it is all one to usto us who do not command tomorrows expedition	116.06372844187982
chatillon and flamarens looked at each other	6.577960148733677
there was such irony in the words and in the bearing of aramis that the duke had	51.39626066727156
you promise sirthats agreedthat i shall find you tomorrow at charenton	127.75316968953706
oh do nt be afraid sir replied aramis and the two gentlemen shortly afterward le	61.569686034700446
for what reason is all this fume and fury asked athos	59.90594935763679
what have they done to you	27.65130879955401
theydid you not see what they did	67.6181371031995
they laughed when we swore that we had done our duty in england	108.54204438366702
now if they believed us they laughed in order to insult us if they did not belie	61.77742566760055
however i m glad not to fight them until tomorrow	88.53326971376202
i hope we shall have something better to do tonight than to draw the sword	61.77480398151459
what have we to do	21.02981335350167
egad to take mazarin	67.24422277452621
athos curled his lip with disdain	164.01148982694733
these undertakings do not suit me as you know aramis	61.59311874654717
because it is taking people unawares	460.80089035090634
really athos you would make a singular general	104.43554227207254
you would fight only by broad daylight warn your foe before an attack and never 	348.3177304590736
athos smiled	86.76306553401625
you know one can not change his nature he said	106.66565172978397
besides do you know what is our situation and whether mazarins arrest would nt b	147.72180523252482
say at once you disapprove of my proposal	71.28653219795007
i think you ought to do nothing since you exacted a promise from these gentlemen	89.72991709452131
i have entered into no engagement and consider myself quite free	328.95229577727827
come come	7.715698333589073
either to seek the duc de beaufort or the duc de bouillon and to tell them about	23.60935491660421
yes but on one conditionthat we begin by the coadjutor	70.39255101502516
he is a priest learned in cases of conscience and we will tell him ours	64.67920818738078
it was then agreed that they were to go first to monsieur de bouillon as his hou	21.46707173873065
they reentered the boat which had brought them to the louvre and thence proceede	42.357984143626744
but raoul was not at the hotel du grand charlemagne	30.88215175315271
he had received a message from the prince to whom he had hastened with olivain t	25.191291651314188
chapter lxxvii	2.3702979195606826
the three lieutenants of the generalissimo	44.07885656925917
the night was dark but still the town resounded with those noises that disclose 	174.35670832803675
athos and aramis did not proceed a hundred steps without being stopped by sentin	43.600339857480364
on arriving at the hotel de bouillon they came across a little troop of three ca	38.86332902453738
on seeing them athos and aramis stood still	62.56933434837851
oh cried aramis do you see count	24.23698569122659
yes said athos	4.023547563378446
who do these three cavaliers appear to you to be	118.7343740549885
what do you think aramis	9.536171970813294
why they are our men	58.681777813695504
you are not mistaken i recognize monsieur de flamarens	26.092587692605296
and i monsieur de chatillon	41.8183607297245

athos smiled but did not reply	36.623736326845425
five minutes afterward they knocked at the princes door	48.59900687409729
this door was guarded by a sentinel and there was also a guard placed in the cou	43.862144488546804
monsieur de bouillon had the gout but notwithstanding his illness which had prev	57.3879716506118

and executed in our presence	353.47529186825136

the two friends saluted the duke	19.90914132678267

poor king charles but after all he was somewhat to blame in all that business an	109.96660357709307

athos and aramis took their leave but even in the antechamber they could still h	43.92634850290514
when they reached the street aramis said	27.711802516314204
well athos what do you think	18.775996627778138
of whom	66.61004553863222
pardieu of monsieur de bouillon	23.557676257873922
my friend i think that he is much troubled with gout	52.94701449652951
you noticed that i did nt breathe a word as to the purpose of our visit	71.77469048893771
you did well you would have caused him an access of his disease	86.58848669827094
let us go to monsieur de beaufort	5.089294473806358
the two friends went to the hotel de vendome	9.10758115426724
it was ten oclock when they arrived	19.38591785778773
the hotel de vendome was not less guarded than the hotel de bouillon and present	48.720438475840005
there were sentinels a guard in the court stacks of arms and horses saddled	123.39499936343184
two horsemen going out as athos and aramis entered were obliged to give place to	65.97967831617075
ah ah gentlemen said aramis decidedly it is a night for meetings	54.95606784416668
we shall be very unfortunate if after meeting so often this evening we should no	171.97446727950756
oh as to that sir replied chatillon for it was he who with flamarens was leaving	53.41130015452633

as for me i am sure of it said the duke	7.61550586885083
de flamarens and de chatillon continued on their way and athos and aramis dismou	22.861654933406413
hardly had they given the bridles of their horses to their lackeys and rid thems	50.56375117222968

you are still with us i presume	53.74389297613061
more than ever	47.852234235491046
and the duke	32.10476278916348
furious against the cardinal	93.95766378044961
you know his successour dear duke he is really king of paris he ca nt go out wit	97.55001111095714
ah so much the better can we have the honor of seeing his highness	36.758330196225344
i shall be proud to present you and rochefort walked on	51.95016833596201
every door was opened to him	33.74572236004575
monsieur de beaufort was at supper but he rose quickly on hearing the two friend	47.025561638205865
ah he cried by jove you re welcome sirs	102.39282119335508

boisgoli let him send one of his best but not such a one as he made for la ramee	74.10725101425597
thank god we do nt want either rope ladders or gagpears now	234.17875365529514
my lord said athos do not let us disturb you	13.5169189433401
we came merely to inquire after your health and to take your orders	127.57322453144693
as to my health since it has stood five years of prison with monsieur de chavign	68.47182247261415
in short my lord said athos glancing at aramis your highness is discontented wit	49.58421101487652
discontented sir say my highness is furious to such a degree i assure you though	104.12163549064314
at this athos and aramis could not help exchanging not only a look but a smile a	70.44993831955826
my lord said athos we are satisfied we came here only to express our loyalty and	38.805849860593305
my most faithful friends gentlemen my most faithful friends you have proved it	81.6107771853581
and if ever i am reconciled with the court i shall prove to you i hope that i re	51.23856356085346
dartagnan and porthos	9.221659352976491
ah yes	19.89519089162935
you understand then comte de la fere you understand chevalier dherblay that i am	42.18626757515723
athos and aramis bowed and went out	18.98769977885707
my dear athos cried aramis i think you consented to accompany me only to give me	21.23181460688071
wait a little aramis it will be time for you to perceive my motive when we have 	42.32615418142504
let us then go to the archiepiscopal palace said aramis	13.78492286644278
they directed their horses to the city	52.14174639718488
on arriving at the cradle from which paris sprang they found it inundated with w	68.01874344704615
the palace rose from the bosom of the water and to see the number of boats aroun	50.96142108952854
some of these boats were dark and mysterious others noisy and lighted up with to	107.24532028901109
the friends slid in through this congestion of embarkation and landed in their t	119.321352809464
the palace was surrounded with water but a kind of staircase had been fixed to t	54.236394848132576
thus did athos and aramis make their appearance in the antechamber where about a	60.7710690781932
good heavens said aramis to athos does the coadjutor intend to indulge himself i	63.758149282523924
my dear friend we must take people as we find them	38.791780065720964
the coadjutor is at this moment one of the seven kings of paris and has a court	48.54783129905824
let us send in our names and if he does not send us a suitable message we will l	35.81563032618266
let us call one of these lackeys with a demipistole in the left hand	56.2582403852317
exactly so cried aramis	38.12321309759226
ah if i m not mistaken heres bazin	80.15858436643896
come here fellow	1744.5193492028664
bazin who was crossing the antechamber majestically in his clerical dress turned	149.8402377651237
a truce to compliments said aramis we want to see the coadjutor and instantly as	71.55779381585816
certainly sirit is not such lords as you are who are allowed to wait in the ante	66.08670287409488
de bruy cried the friends tis then useless our seeing monsieur the coadjutor thi	154.41565980115675
and they hastened to quit the palace followed by bazin who was lavish of bows an	68.41258852332243
well said athos when aramis and he were in the boat again are you beginning to b	65.34309268335674
you are wisdom incarnate athos aramis replied	118.12639774500641
what had especially been observed by the two friends was the little interest tak	106.70019271849505
in fact aside from a poor widow and a royal orphan who wept in the corner of the	81.1926977200843

the two friends made an appointment for ten oclock on the following day for thou	64.42815382476017
at ten oclock the next day they met again	21.59014617005827
athos had been out since six oclock	101.87031866431596
well have you any news athos asked	39.26180191374555
no one has seen dartagnan and porthos has not appeared	32.39211563541546
have you anything	13.531109421893124
the devil said aramis	28.069328220957626
in fact said athos this delay is not natural they took the shortest route and sh	82.95780457505242
add to that dartagnans rapidity in action and that he is not the man to lose an 	69.93816696931181
he expected you will remember to be here on the fifth	85.09879257216203
and here we are at the ninth	47.30079439005612
this evening the margin of possible delay expires	135.93574775003026
what do you think should be done asked athos if we have no news of them tonight	22.748388647194133
pardieu we must go and look for them	52.23394568426068
all right said athos	13.747821364929395
but raoul said aramis	15.261236442942097
a light cloud passed over the counts face	50.55696447259816
raoul gives me much uneasiness he said	96.51149246120835
he received yesterday a message from the prince de cond he went to meet him at s	41.201744059698875
have you seen madame de chevreuse	7.47123087281039
she was not at home	16.90602953925269
and you aramis you were going i think to visit madame de longueville	43.746594622887436
i did go there	205.0650128087899
she was no longer there but she had left her new address	60.885842889971386
where was she	78.44701431048627
guess i give you a thousand chances	53.79323493802639
how should i know where the most beautiful and active of the frondists was at mi	42.32064466755739
at the hotel de ville my dear fellow	13.183642671191196
what at the hotel de ville has she then been appointed provost of merchants	134.8908152604138
no but she has become queen of paris ad interim and since she could not venture 	66.83402677290987
you did nt tell me of that aramis	29.14467595425519
really it was my forgetfulness then pardon me	125.4031702329774
now asked athos what are we to do with ourselves till evening here we are withou	30.0458773376029
you forget my friend that we have work cut out for us in the direction of charen	29.161280965159822
why have you hated him	44.87873784927537
because he is the brother of coligny	16.481361225504042
ah true he who presumed to be a rival of yours for which he was severely punishe	41.04971556710386
yes but it does not i am rancorousthe only stigma that proves me to be a churchm	39.66436987579259
do you understand you understand that you are in no way obliged to go with me	34.800021540236955
come now said athos you are joking	25.193273733033617
in that case my dear friend if you are resolved to accompany me there is no time	18.702523951337824
i supposed said athos that last nights conferences would modify those warlike ar	315.98744935746527
no doubt but they will fight none the less if only to mask the conferences	215.11554215604323
poor creatures said athos who are going to be killed in order that monsieur de b	42.42844232248569
come come dear athos confess that you would not be so philosophical if your raou	30.309475900923413
perhaps you speak the truth aramis	112.89461069433843
well let us go then where the fighting is for that is the most likely place to m	60.267789979506055
stop there are a fine body of citizens passing quite attractive by jupiter and t	100.08787839007879

planchet prouder than ever of his new duties deigned to explain to the two gentl	71.7091798362573
this day will be a warm one said planchet in a warlike tone	32.11690491855739
no doubt said aramis but it is far from here to the enemy	40.53306895457623
sir the distance will be diminished said a subordinate	210.7568600046694
aramis saluted then turning toward athos	92.60597747189108
i do nt care to camp on the place royale with all these people he said	94.86758983345946
shall we go forward we shall see better what is going on	46.53222629169048
and then monsieur de chatillon will not come to the place royale to look for you	27.69999830677515
come then my friend we will go forward	37.709853875524495
have nt you something to say to monsieur de flamarens on your own account	29.39569306797638
my friend said athos i have made a resolution never to draw my sword save when i	42.583861103867
and how long ago was that	253.77208416719628
when i last drew my poniard	434.78949887171814
ah good another souvenir of monsieur mordaunt	185.52521160959216
well my friend nothing now is lacking except that you should feel remorse for ha	227.90499467231058
hush said athos putting a finger on his lips with the sad smile peculiar to him 	21.230149254762303
and athos set forward toward charenton followed closely by aramis	90.65053966013971
chapter lxxviii	2.6052063935994396
the battle of charenton	22.347884273787383
as athos and aramis proceeded and passed different companies on the road they be	94.13749370019006
ah my friend cried athos suddenly where have you brought us i fancy i perceive a	77.52294961370572
goodday sirs said the duke advancing you are puzzled by what you see here but on	93.91694712790321
there is now a truce and a conference	68.57785343975519
the prince monsieur de retz the duc de beaufort the duc de bouillon are talking 	16.366707216389564
now one of two things must happen either matters will not be arranged or they wi	107.19904988228967
sir said aramis you speak to the point	17.98267558322132
allow me to ask you a question where are the plenipotentiaries	42.08559676650148
at charenton in the second house on the right on entering from the direction of 	33.475863289575706
and was this conference arranged beforehand	457.381504748633
no gentlemen it seems to be the result of certain propositions which mazarin mad	86.53127959374369
athos and aramis exchanged smiles for they well knew what those propositions wer	150.16740394315897
and that house in which the plenipotentiaries are asked athos belongs to	154.5533377134239
to monsieur de chanleu who commands your troops at charenton	50.23714647090842
i say your troops for i presume that you gentlemen are frondeurs	78.01292093179491
yes almost said aramis	87.52711435090181
we are for the king and the princes added athos	40.219277798989125
we must understand each other said the duke	20.70301122598377
the king is with us and his generals are the duke of orleans and the prince de c	50.398994659481986
yes answered athos but his right place is in our ranks with the prince de conti 	59.8932676702432
such are my orders	198.97791071648342
sir since you command the cavalry	356.5880493173796

you must know all your officersi mean those more distinguished	178.12364625993393
why yes very nearly	773.9301533887661

no sir he is not with us he left paris more than six weeks ago and is believed t	49.08098641934817
i knew that but i supposed he had returned	121.28982922430504
no sir no one has seen him	40.60361830528218
i can answer positively on that point for the musketeers belong to our forces an	113.14833807219246
the two friends looked at each other	5.287957659038572
you see said athos	13.840465952971199
it is strange said aramis	11.05078365751
it is absolutely certain that some misfortune has happened to them on the way	55.51030397548041
if we have no news of them this evening tomorrow we must start	29.276112980427055
athos nodded affirmatively then turning	444.8210140448205
and monsieur de bragelonne a young man fifteen years of age attached to the prin	16.139759514904934
yes surely he came with the prince a charming young man he is one of your friend	68.43937615282286
yes sir answered athos agitated so much so that i wish to see him if possible	46.47908241440888
quite possible sir do me the favor to accompany me and i will conduct you to hea	41.6960153497224
halloo there cried aramis turning around what a noise behind us	164.25293526552076
a body of cavaliers is coming toward us said chatillon	157.16276231362284
i recognize the coadjutor by his frondist hat	161.5126970872864

they are coming full gallop the prince is with themah he is leaving them	114.43646730281642
they are beating the rappel cried chatillon we must discover what is going on	65.68503992502056
in fact they saw the soldiers running to their arms the trumpets sounded the dru	69.96251606217245
on his side the prince sounded a rappel and all the officers of the royalist arm	106.65039417724059
gentlemen cried chatillon the truce is broken that is evident they are going to 	60.28359790925049
the cornet of a troop had in fact just raised the standard of the prince	96.67901338808149
farewell till the next time we meet cried chatillon and he set off full gallop	40.193041204156984

and besides we have a prisoner said athos pointing to raoul	32.60807681726913
the three cavaliers continued their road on full gallop	77.03282313690556
what were you doing in the battle my friend inquired athos of the youth twas not	43.19862138281042

thank you for the compliment my young friend replied aramis we can see from whom	50.484790151097606
then you were going to rueil	15.957849928691571
yes i have a despatch from the prince to his eminence	40.33368382911358
you must still deliver it said athos	50.52393602039359
no false generosity count the fate of our friends to say nothing of our own is p	97.30894070092154
this young man must not however fail in his duty said athos	61.04436383711191

the young man hesitated and looked at athos as if seeking to read in his eyes a 	29.149707198210994
give him the despatch raoul you are the chevaliers prisoner	79.45112855477909
raoul gave it up reluctantly aramis instantly seized and read it	125.80475001127871

well said aramis what think you about these two enemies whom it requires besides	149.21102169726376
well search paris all day long said athos and if we have no news this evening we	56.97624845103753

having escaped these dangers they returned by the main road to boulogne at abbev	66.01989844658623
nevertheless they were still in a state of uncertainty	32.993716960696524
several inns were visited by them several innkeepers questioned without a single	157.02523076644576

this is capital said athos to aramis we were to have slept here but we cannotwe 	49.13237258417225
they rode forward and reached abbeville	122.04978731845313
there the great number of inns puzzled them they could not go to all how could t	114.82898859602636
trust me said aramis do not expect to find anything in abbeville	27.221978942163698
if we had only been looking for porthos porthos would have stationed himself in 	49.29002694725704
but dartagnan is devoid of such weaknesses	78.69447340462841
porthos would have found it very difficult even to make him see that he was dyin	37.83671921178676
they continued their route	174.2294678104287
it had now become a weary and almost hopeless task and had it not been for the t	92.14479569363145
they proceeded thus to peronne	50.962818375888546
athos began to despair	65.79387674142615
his noble nature felt that their ignorance was a sort of reflection upon them	154.1718389531542
they had not looked carefully enough for their lost friends	163.19314916625896
they had not shown sufficient pertinacity in their inquiries	157.79902224384708
they were willing and ready to retrace their steps when in crossing the suburb w	60.992544102543896
oh exclaimed athos here it is as clear as day pursued as he was dartagnan would 	52.094552698669574
aramis shook his head	10.733041958932251
had he escaped we should either have seen him or have heard him spoken of	100.72378164202102
you are right aramis let us travel on	21.686479566211993
to describe the impatience and anxiety of these two friends would be impossible	136.17734895629837
uneasiness took possession of the tender constant heart of athos and fearful for	183.1574603457617
they galloped on for two or three hours as furiously as the cavaliers on the wal	46.576190965370024
all at once in a narrow pass they perceived that the road was partially barricad	83.96987208458135
it had evidently been rolled across the pass by some arm of giant strength	419.86498892149643
aramis stopped	259.4945881494713
oh he said looking at the stone this is the work of either hercules or porthos	45.10078450005178
let us get down count and examine this rock	134.7340276461336
they both alighted	288.5903094782878
the stone had been brought with the evident intention of barricading the road bu	106.57993261265833
with the assistance of blaisois and grimaud the friends succeeded in turning the	58.21703386217176
upon the side next the ground were scratched the following words	199.0992043893696
eight of the light dragoons are pursuing us	84.92343192058651
if we reach compiegne we shall stop at the peacock	48.350007050506505
it is kept by a friend of ours	66.14922190449852
at last we have something definite said athos let us go to the peacock	20.138925865154366
yes answered aramis but if we are to get there we must rest our horses for they 	37.406314359647496
aramis was right they stopped at the first tavern and made each horse swallow a 	161.3739752045448
the men themselves were almost dead with fatigue but hope supported them	438.4274097103319
in six hours they reached compiegne and alighted at the peacock	33.59509177520901
the host proved to be a worthy man as bald as a chinaman	38.0021637475824
they asked him if some time ago he had not received in his house two gentlemen w	60.46614871147823
do you know that he asked	7.03694089610269
athos merely glanced at it	497.358694595566
tis dartagnans sword he said	124.39690097509278
does it belong to the smaller or to the larger of the two asked the host	56.77471738825846
to the smaller	32.007249050499354
i see that you are the friends of these gentlemen	27.298248384044655
well what has happened to them	32.88784140616429
they were pursued by eight of the light dragoons who rode into the courtyard bef	40.97317426308581
eight said aramis it surprises me that two such heroes as porthos and dartagnan 	67.36164935141868
the eight men would doubtless have failed had they not been assisted by twenty s	192.3792252345822
arrested were they inquired athos is it known why	249.8536768593209
no sir they were carried off instantly and had not even time to tell me why but 	106.59868731201946
tis still a consolation that they were not wounded said aramis	104.0357284184639
where were they taken asked athos	57.66834911651444
toward the town of louvres was the reply	19.23901356865483
the two friends having agreed to leave blaisois and grimaud at compiegne with th	26.41906737569179
here they found only one inn in which was consumed a liqueur which preserves its	111.6474720580922
let us alight here said athos	15.896841374621877
dartagnan will not have let slip an opportunity of drinking a glass of this liqu	64.13530591245963
they went into the town and asked for two glasses of liqueur at the counteras th	43.74670935304812
the counter was covered with a plate of pewter upon this plate was written with 	126.4848101257595
they went to rueil cried aramis	21.120781149127478
let us go to rueil said athos	3.6609684053770533
it is to throw ourselves into the wolfs jaws said aramis	60.436372066428575
had i been as great a friend of jonah as i am of dartagnan i should have followe	26.1102860958882
certainlybut you make me out better than i am dear count	84.31632987612629
had i been alone i should scarcely have gone to rueil without great caution	134.17291663447946
but where you go i go	131.07799180769325
they then set off for rueil	35.43131234556405
here the deputies of the parliament had just arrived in order to enter upon thos	49.27022938016628
rueil was crowded with advocates presidents and councillors who came from the pa	90.47857884537926
the two friends mingled with the crowd and fancied that every one was occupied w	41.42497116618714
they expected to hear some mention made of dartagnan or of porthos but every one	140.38496368381928
it was the advice of athos to go straight to the minister	25.95084387277862
my friend said aramis take care our safety lies in our obscurity	101.3933581398996
if we were to make ourselves known we should be sent to rejoin our friends in so	59.37723727569281
let us try not to find them out by accident but from our notions	72.95174970968561
arrested at compiegne they have been carried to rueil at rueil they have been qu	22.368471068656252
as to the bastile they are not there though the bastile is especially for the fr	40.266233867195496
they are not dead for the death of dartagnan would make a sensation	40.058036428728016
as for porthos i believe him to be eternal like god although less patient	123.72370095874236
do not let us despond but wait at rueil for my conviction is that they are at ru	42.927766819487566
but what ails you you are pale	45.52450061690059
it is this answered athos with a trembling voice	29.623082090645944
i remember that at the castle of rueil the cardinal richelieu had some horrible 	44.537016586881435
oh never fear said aramis	68.41451322859005
richelieu was a gentleman our equal in birth our superior in position	359.6860238409836
he could like the king touch the greatest of us on the head and touching them ma	97.81135888000514
but mazarin is a lowborn rogue who can at the most take us by the collar like an	120.77750857486951
be calmfor i am sure that dartagnan and porthos are at rueil alive and well	28.92254517444155
but resumed athos i recur to my first proposal	117.06983683724482
i know no better means than to act with candor	180.7160600682652
i shall seek not mazarin but the queen and say to her madame restore to us your 	165.9457549156315
aramis shook his head	11.479988647449426
tis a last resource but let us not employ it till it is imperatively called for 	80.90219279068063
they continued their inquiries and at last met with a light dragoon who had form	91.64871308731784
athos however perpetually recurred to his proposed interview with the queen	234.39358418320347
in order to see the queen said aramis we must first see the cardinal and when we	23.808831457648083
now that way of joining them is not very attractive to me i confess	95.74007092223543
let us act in freedom that we may act well and quickly	103.59045914518585
i shall go he said to the queen	25.12293336473297
well then answered aramis pray tell me a day or two beforehand that i may take t	59.48790360818489
to whom	37.742477355882954
zounds how do i know perhaps to madame de longueville	44.2231736904016
she is allpowerful yonder she will help me	99.07859362542189
but send me word should you be arrested for then i will return directly	117.60607121327966
why do you not take your chance and be arrested with me	41.43941310084087
no i thank you	17.626910276279553

my friend since i killed chatillon adored of the ladies of saint germain i am to	53.013468672104516
the queen is likely to follow mazarins counsels and to have me tried	156.85782365285579
do you think she loves this italian so much as they say she does	46.54371015095882
did she not love an englishman	81.32001721624478
my friend she is a woman	24.87150931766759
no no you are deceivedshe is a queen	68.59603731074083

yes madame here i have a right to do so for it concerns monsieur dartagnandartag	40.810253186284854
the cardinal saw that it was now high time to come to the assistance of anne	44.69000394529802
sir he said i can tell you what is at present unknown to her majesty	38.467625440771165
these individuals are under arrest	930.4919144119622
they disobeyed orders	2091.1255582195026

what you ask is merely an affair of discipline and does not concern me said the 	83.3346506695067
monsieur dartagnan never made such an answer as that when the service of your ma	59.69564965506828
he was going toward the door when mazarin stopped him	27.981236128450817

sir said anne to mazarin with an accent from which daily habits of dissimulation	44.71841901101289
i wish to do madame all that your majesty pleases	49.182335052626605

i have another name madamei am called athos	89.11585862490011
madame said mazarin with a smile you may rest easy your wishes shall be fulfille	30.64273084690922
you hear sir said the queen	15.865997162877047
yes madame i expected nothing less from the justice of your majesty	88.93077832135604
may i not go and see my friends	23.864167430159743
yes sir you shall see them	44.594329363183896

scarcely however had the tapestry closed behind athos when she said to mazarin	94.83158849828223
cardinal desire them to arrest that insolent fellow before he leaves the court	319.0380221821325
your majesty answered mazarin desires me to do only what i was going to ask you 	30.16048204740688
these bravoes who resuscitate in our epoch the traditions of another reign are t	172.40618432185173
athos was not altogether the queens dupe but he was not a man to run away on sus	32.1017318009663
he waited then in the antechamber with impatience till he should be conducted to	70.92966195162009
he walked to the window and looked into the court	38.011651193393426
he saw the deputation from the parisians enter it they were coming to assign the	65.17996632935157
a very imposing escort awaited them without the gates	230.1041138955093
athos was looking on attentively when some one touched him softly on the shoulde	76.98651786595883
ah monsieur de comminges he said	14.698533353019187
yes count and charged with a commission for which i beg of you to accept my excu	46.149089499434986
what is it	5.236536317418882
be so good as to give me up your sword count	33.10844163978174
athos smiled and opened the window	70.82343934258277
aramis he cried	70.5312470300258
a gentleman turned around	209.3377216957257
athos fancied he had seen him among the crowd	66.67722456646202
it was aramis	9.714356762128103
he bowed with great friendship to the count	80.49027638427535
aramis cried athos i am arrested	35.766163288084556
good replied aramis calmly	53.4580807815067

now whither do you conduct me	136.46999772075472
into my room first replied comminges the queen will ultimately decide your place	123.82917184424133

cardinal mazarin as king	159.14885422727252
the arrest produced no sensation indeed was almost unknown and scarcely interrup	393.81005609878537
to the deputation it was formally announced that the queen would receive it	100.44488077492586
accordingly it was admitted to the presence of anne who silent and lofty as ever	56.75985664359438
on the other hand mazarin present at that audience heard very well what those de	252.50744536210334
it was purely and simply his removal in terms clear and precise	214.16952692432932
the discourse being finished the queen remained silent	167.04826705728385
gentlemen said mazarin i join with you in supplicating the queen to put an end t	37.97192303751724
i have done all in my power to ameliorate them and yet the belief of the public 	38.54147094427437

i own myself conquered	596.2635082525687

if paris has injuries to complain of who has not some wrongs to be redressed par	93.28717869649479
tis not for me a private individual to disunite a queen from her kingdom	111.86318624187119
since you demand my resignation i retire	230.40835504392743
then said aramis in his neighbors ear the conferences are over	90.31271468714695
there is nothing to do but to send monsieur mazarin to the most distant frontier	51.55820446617586

the deputies bowed and left the room	37.3835170620479
what exclaimed the queen when the last of them had quitted the apartment you wou	66.92194724010614
to promote your majestys welfare madame replied mazarin fixing his penetrating e	102.25581317499193
anne dropped her head and fell into one of those reveries so habitual with her	82.00449345846658
a recollection of athos came into her mind	101.59652683071349
his fearless deportment his words so firm yet dignified the shades which by one 	225.78405397270632

well you do not answer cardinal what do you think about it	34.24992901362535
i am thinking madame of the allusion made by that insolent gentleman whom you ha	109.73701587588104
anne drew up as she always did when anything touched her pride	139.47132971464706
she blushed and that she might not answer clasped her beautiful hands till her s	129.02292734605376
that man has sagacity honor and wit not to mention likewise that he is a man of 	112.88147636616846
you know something about him do you not madame i shall tell him therefore and in	59.19100210564537
what is proposed to me would be in fact almost an abdication and an abdication r	77.60594531621294
an abdication repeated anne i thought sir that it was kings alone who abdicated	107.77020823785226
well replied mazarin and am i not almost a kingking indeed of france thrown over	87.07623509315593
this was one of the humiliations which mazarin made anne undergo more frequently	87.12516078832554

of russia are the only two monarchs of their set on record who were at once sove	97.6779659831326

sir she replied did i not say and did you not hear me say to those people that y	58.93215862825826
in that case said mazarin i think it must please me best to remain not only on a	53.375579809267315
remain then sir nothing can be more agreeable to me only do not allow me to be i	51.5472653606888
you are referring to the demands of the rebels and to the tone in which they sta	53.45875629195669
no we shall beat them by merely temporizing	264.4315319334283
they want food already	3846.7499501463185
they will be ten times worse off in a week	88.19164359122891
ah yes good heavens i know it will end in that way but it is not they who taunt 	69.45272895971034
i understand you mean to allude to the recollections perpetually revived by thes	94.44403985500009
however we have them safe in prison and they are just sufficiently culpable for 	70.46045375969777
one only is still not in our power and braves us	106.70253316053025
but devil take him we shall soon succeed in sending him to join his boon compani	134.99898212793667
we have accomplished more difficult things than that	193.66816077786223
in the first place i have as a precaution shut up at rueil near me under my own 	76.19016627088283
today the third will be there also	114.3404141639428
as long as they are in prison all will be well said anne but one of these days t	33.06367536786519
yes if your majesty releases them	63.92198435553985
ah exclaimed anne following the train of her own thoughts on such occasions one 	114.252068541876
why so	38.69910816829077
on account of the bastile sir which is so strong and so secure	62.23945196906111
madame these conferences will bring us peace when we have peace we shall regain 	131.5079651096457
anne frowned slightly when mazarin in taking leave kissed her hand	332.48804632214535
mazarin after this half humble half gallant attention went away	378.0455627500459
anne followed him with her eyes and as he withdrew at every step he took a disda	37.61948860755759

after quitting anne mazarin took the road to rueil where he usually resided in t	32.29983532381502
in military dress he was indeed as we have stated a very handsome man	65.52712131203602
in the court of the old chateau of saint germain he entered his coach and reache	25.42274740870241
the prince had supplied him with fifty light horse not so much by way of guard a	210.2252006900439

grimaud finding that his master had been arrested fell back into the ranks near 	81.11596078212538
grimaud had indeed during twentytwo years of service seen his master extricate h	174.79415559697208
at the branching off of the road toward paris aramis who had followed in the car	34.79903421461222
mazarin went to the right hand and aramis could see the prisoner disappear at th	47.83193077022554
athos at the same moment moved by a similar impulse looked back also	85.0197017289646
the two friends exchanged a simple inclination of the head and aramis put his fi	35.05803841617471
ten minutes afterward mazarin entered the court of that chateau which his predec	29.58319063275507

my lord answered comminges he begs to be taken to the place where monsieur darta	31.28005042967846
mazarin thought for an instant	41.461678553584214
comminges saw that he was undecided	34.99145115144962
tis a very strong post he resumed and we have forty good men tried soldiers havi	224.69810115491737
if we put these three men together monsieur comminges said mazarin we must doubl	38.66993547677248
comminges smiled mazarin read and construed that smile	158.04903161842248
you do not know these men monsieur comminges but i know them first personally al	40.72782679531347
i sent them to carry aid to king charles and they performed prodigies to save hi	140.82088797134014
but since they served your eminence so well why are they my lord cardinal in pri	117.83734356666798
in prison said mazarin and when has rueil been a prison	95.3742738588094
ever since there were prisoners in it answered comminges	125.40018042405266
these gentlemen comminges are not prisoners returned mazarin with his ironical s	87.51814153205466
so much do i esteem them that i am going to make the comte de la fere a visit th	24.908966581682805
well while taking my walk i will call on him and we will talk	90.0350321851325
although he professes to be my enemy i have sympathy for him and if he is reason	71.48498166412257
comminges bowed and returned to athos who was awaiting with apparent calmness bu	49.68170652684304
well he said to the lieutenant	27.34799838682099
sir replied comminges it seems that it is impossible	13.123217902490024
monsieur de comminges said athos i have been a soldier all my life and i know th	13.458665898280943
i will do it with all my heart said comminges for i know who you are and what se	37.11447280689172
i am entirely at your service except only for my orders	68.13063490783017
thank you sir what i am about to ask will not compromise you in any degree	35.54889324034624
if it should even compromise me a little said monsieur de comminges with a smile	31.819564577233844
i do nt like mazarin any better than you do	52.574296704942576
i serve the queen and that draws me naturally into the service of the cardinal b	97.34968888566938
speak then i beg of you i wait and listen	51.32992455191333
since there is no harm said athos in my knowing that dartagnan is here i presume	56.30319191690017
i have received no orders on that point	111.28524625416793
well then do me the kindness to give him my regards and tell him that i am his n	47.68255515043036
tell him also what you have just told methat mazarin has placed me in the pavili	47.85658120922726
which can not last interrupted comminges the cardinal said so there is no prison	110.68886120480839
but there are oubliettes replied athos smiling	65.14181097915231
oh that s a different thing yes i know there are traditions of that sort said co	41.28361376486657
it was in the time of the other cardinal who was a great nobleman but our mazari	27.937193899894904
oubliettes are employed as a means of kingly vengeance and a lowborn fellow such	114.36844178220028
your arrest is known that of your friends will soon be known and all the nobilit	74.01451388699779
no no be easy on that score	44.37501950037708
i will however inform monsieur dartagnan of your arrival here	140.51120375606388
comminges then led the count to a room on the ground floor of a pavilion at the 	26.083960650801362
they passed through a courtyard as they went full of soldiers and courtiers	67.09173663426229
in the centre of this court in the form of a horseshoe were the buildings occupi	37.06112649324547
from the ends of these two wings extended the park	79.64936376677255
athos when he reached his appointed room observed through the gratings of his wi	75.34806784322979
yes tis too true said comminges tis almost a prison but what a singular fancy th	96.97025089449879
a frondeur you the comte de la fere on the side of broussel blancmesnil and viol	11.733576960728412
on my word of honor said athos one must be either a mazarinist or a frondeur	24.77883904369747
for a long time i had these words whispered in my ears and i chose the latter at	72.18198794390642
and now i am a frondeurnot of broussels party nor of blancmesnils nor am i with 	45.94297358636011
besides what a charming outlook it would have been to serve the cardinal look at	56.2567113229017
yes replied de comminges more especially if it could reveal how monsieur dartagn	129.8666308168861
poor dartagnan said athos with the charming melancholy that was one of the trait	21.031347662324436
you have two unruly prisoners there sir	209.98695749043694
unruly comminges smiled you wish to terrify me i suppose	114.19722072210217
when he came here monsieur dartagnan provoked and braved the soldiers and inferi	90.21169893946627
that mood lasted some time but now he s as gentle as a lamb and sings gascon son	151.58691731016856
and du vallon asked athos	45.5524362352024
ah he s quite another sort of persona formidable gentleman indeed	441.2602755424579
the first day he broke all the doors in with a single push of his shoulder and i	51.07934085714408
but his temper cooled down like his friends he not only gets used to his captivi	130.39083031660346
so much the better said athos	4.959243217077411
do you think anything else was to be expected of them asked comminges who puttin	31.946128770008382
athos on the other hand reflected that this recent gentleness of his friends mos	64.8054419001663
unwilling to injure them by praising them too highly he replied they they are tw	144.79844639088168
you have had a proof of that in what you have just related to me	28.5893087319793
this too was the opinion of comminges who withdrew somewhat reassured	180.60958269287102
athos remained alone in the vast chamber where according to the cardinals direct	129.57905926288575
he awaited mazarins promised visit to get some light on his present situation	378.9566424635917

strength and sagacity	103.54216133483206
now let us pass the orangery to the hunting lodge	31.209572220514964
at the extremity of the courtyard where close to a portico formed of ionic colum	36.11036842431266
it was in this pavilion on the ground floor that dartagnan and porthos were conf	22.937642992883003
dartagnan was pacing to and fro like a caged tiger with dilated eyes growling as	139.00849224473205
porthos was ruminating over an excellent dinner he had just demolished	130.00603736617873
the one seemed to be deprived of reason yet he was meditating	110.39805352726974
the other seemed to meditate yet he was more than half asleep	175.06958862346485
but his sleep was a nightmare which might be guessed by the incoherent manner in	88.99793156880366
look said dartagnan day is declining	167.72070873719156
it must be nearly four oclock	40.233635128521506
we have been in this place nearly eightythree hours	102.54150260459792
hem muttered porthos with a kind of pretense of answering	49.68837573301268
did you hear eternal sleeper cried dartagnan irritated that any one could doze d	112.46182283717488
what said porthos	14.132668020111726
i say we have been here eightythree hours	165.29966075816452
tis your fault answered porthos	64.70299131676151
how my fault	245.79632605243273
yes i offered you escape	315.48685340236955
by pulling out a bar and pushing down a door	189.16064475410576
porthos men like us ca nt go out from here purely and simply	212.4913965458725
faith said porthos as for me i could go out with that purity and that simplicity	37.42332553967042
dartagnan shrugged his shoulders	21.79389732819956
and besides he said going out of this chamber is nt all	92.06297543095225
dear friend said porthos you appear to be in a somewhat better humor today than 	48.18481206514842
explain to me why going out of this chamber is nt everything	124.32603727442495
because having neither arms nor password we should nt take fifty steps in the co	138.43453058749526
very well said porthos we will kill the sentinel and we shall have his arms	17.4269884901057
yes but before we can kill himand he will be hard to kill that swisshe will shri	48.40674428334171
lackaday if we only had some one to instruct us about the physical and moral top	152.0012262049643
ah when one thinks that for twenty years during which time i did not know what t	74.68100277103308
what difference does that make said porthos	189.4420035295912
we shall go out all the same	23.42760825495618
do you know my dear fellow why master pastrycooks never work with their hands	88.48557853694612
no said porthos but i should be glad to be informed	13.660469782537199
it is because in the presence of their pupils they fear that some of their tarts	57.505157394805565
what then	86.5550906563191
why then they would be laughed at and a master pastrycook must never be laughed 	145.70590939055708
and what have master pastrycooks to do with us	59.41853238095533
we ought in our adventures never to be defeated or give any one a chance to laug	114.94573022554984
in england lately we failed we were beaten and that is a blemish on our reputati	124.54842965556274
by whom then were we beaten asked porthos	86.33616875938304
by mordaunt	19.53044192935527
yes but we have drowned monsieur mordaunt	57.27170743894821
that is true and that will redeem us a little in the eyes of posterity if poster	37.98023479563164
but listen porthos though monsieur mordaunt was a man not to be despised mazarin	57.04442753898656
we must therefore watch and play a close game for he added with a sigh we two ar	146.68682128407121
that is true said porthos echoing dartagnans sigh	32.08642050136559
well porthos follow my examples walk back and forth till some news of our friend	167.7237478324382
but do nt sleep as you do all the time nothing dulls the intellect like sleep	198.27032289867384
as to what may lie before us it is perhaps less serious than we at first thought	144.55181978701984
i do nt believe that monsieur de mazarin thinks of cutting off our heads for hea	45.017043756763655
how well you reason said porthos admiringly	100.82031781699744
well yes pretty well replied dartagnan and besides you see if they put us on tri	57.12548936841465
yes that is inevitable said porthos	30.40613025880351
well it is impossible but that master aramis that keenscented bloodhound and ath	64.73622830589481
then believe me it will be time to act	53.488270409260544
yes we will wait	55.44670805403315
we can wait the more contentedly that it is not absolutely bad here but for one 	95.06556963474446
what is that	7.1649081840963476
did you observe dartagnan that three days running they have brought us braised m	88.19282108456532
no but if it occurs a fourth time i shall complain of it so never mind	70.02926934223717
and then i feel the loss of my house tis a long time since i visited my castles	56.689557735781804
forget them for a time we shall return to them unless mazarin razes them to the 	49.58217770746034
do you think that likely	38.36085375304692
no the other cardinal would have done so but this one is too mean a fellow to ri	87.23603049029934
you reconcile me dartagnan	142.23917824508794
well then assume a cheerful manner as i do we must joke with the guards we must 	129.10354755649323
try porthos to please them more than you are wo nt to do when they are under our	46.938571609547054
thus far you have done nothing but show them your fist and the more respectable 	161.78787570241255
ah i would give much to have five hundred louis only	119.10096747914604
so would i said porthos unwilling to be behind dartagnan in generosity i would g	75.22195577093666
the two prisoners were at this point of their conversation when comminges entere	38.616544606578444
what exclaimed porthos mutton again	371.39719296690447
my dear monsieur de comminges said dartagnan you will find that my friend monsie	12.210924702285018
i declare said porthos i shall eat nothing if they do not take it away	38.59981928921894
remove the mutton cried comminges i wish monsieur du vallon to sup well more esp	75.88643435503946
is mazarin dead asked porthos	60.972159968070706
no i am sorry to tell you he is perfectly well	20.296320923419742
so much the worse said porthos	5.200298214578467
what is that news asked dartagnan	15.025600114444021
news in prison is a fruit so rare that i trust monsieur de comminges you will ex	52.72470208154538
should you be glad to hear that the comte de la fere is well asked de comminges	15.159912865939075
dartagnans penetrating gray eyes were opened to the utmost	85.22626312508692
glad he cried i should be more than glad happybeyond measure	93.92554587483032
well i am desired by him to give you his compliments and to say that he is in go	75.43136078064794
dartagnan almost leaped with joy	376.88211616793325
a quick glance conveyed his thought to porthos if athos knows where we are if he	157.61395429307888
porthos was not very quick to understand the language of glances but now since t	79.10429064061101
do you say asked the gascon timidly that the comte de la fere has commissioned y	15.60419825720145
yes sir	25.58237868582383
then you have seen him	10.126229540025594
certainly i have	15.271893872867782
where if i may ask without indiscretion	225.8309995833824
near here replied de comminges smiling so near that if the windows which look on	90.07243376608336
he is wandering about the environs of the castle thought dartagnan	80.47005226777038
then he said aloud	26.066994790389455
you met him i dare say in the parkhunting perhaps	119.1834008470298
no nearer nearer still	3270.8304330343326
look behind this wall said de comminges knocking against the wall	105.8779732539676
behind this wall what is there then behind this wall i was brought here by night	165.5078003624224
well said comminges suppose one thing	52.26027911008519
i will suppose anything you please	111.02780806604707
suppose there were a window in this wall	78.86768899370747
from that window you would see monsieur de la fere at his	66.67929122007736
the count then is in the chateau	64.287417870341
for what reason	54.54119040538978
the same as yourself	553.5026482624844
athosa prisoner	28416.370606000448
you know well replied de comminges that there are no prisoners at rueil because 	80.2782338420892
do nt let us play upon words sir	117.84093973187917
athos has been arrested	70.96619900912731
yesterday at saint germain as he came out from the presence of the queen	21.117216254678855
the arms of dartagnan fell powerless by his side	40.99415317259758
one might have supposed him thunderstruck a paleness ran like a cloud over his d	122.278486173277
a prisoner he reiterated	254.2317251303198
a prisoner repeated porthos quite dejected	187.86479748767306
suddenly dartagnan looked up and in his eyes there was a gleam which scarcely ev	39.038511586909316
come come said comminges who since dartagnan on the day of broussels arrest had 	32.01053060152978
laugh at the chance which has brought your friend near to you and monsieur du va	98.60727468016879
but dartagnan was still in a desponding mood	27.737138755306745
and how did he look asked porthos who perceiving that dartagnan had allowed the 	33.72526054144137
very well indeed sir replied comminges at first like you he seemed distressed bu	112.591833668305
ah cried dartagnan the cardinal is about to visit the comte de la fere	14.409692048796032
yes and the count desired me to tell you that he should take advantage of this v	25.505618318705636
ah our dear count said dartagnan	21.01533318902635
a fine thing indeed grunted porthos	105.71306128005345
a great favor zounds monsieur the comte de la fere whose family is allied to the	43.914672818668045
no matter said dartagnan in his most wheedling tone	14.476174884581011
on reflection my dear du vallon it is a great honor for the comte de la fere and	14.88436987619639
in fact it seems to me so great an honor for a prisoner that i think monsieur de	42.136399384628156
what i am mistaken	44.460597512726366
monsieur de mazarin will not come to visit the comte de la fere but the comte de	9.65937396056934
no no no said comminges who made a point of having the facts appear exactly as t	66.85847472601642
he will come and visit the comte de la fere	21.66890712669832
dartagnan tried to gather from the expression of his eyes whether porthos unders	52.66712272093955
it is then the cardinals custom to walk in his orangery asked dartagnan	44.87506792509206
every evening he shuts himself in there	185.3826603161939
that it seems is where he meditates on state affairs	262.01426595381287
in that case said dartagnan i begin to believe that monsieur de la fere will rec	18.490226377977102
yestwo soldiers	48504.66992953035
and will he talk thus of affairs in presence of two strangers	246.26242217279048
the soldiers are swiss who understand only german	143.68292020017506
besides according to all probability they will wait at the door	57.61096100643639
dartagnan made a violent effort over himself to keep his face from being too exp	67.21549907949873
let the cardinal take care of going alone to visit the comte de la fere said dar	21.632922969599022
comminges began to laugh	20.82064780129721
oh oh why really one would say that you four were anthropaphagi the count is an 	102.13734781846651
two soldiers said dartagnan seeming to remember something two soldiers yes that 	159.1413414839498
that is it they are waiting for the cardinal or rather for bernouin who comes to	42.58471394623417
finelooking men upon my word said dartagnan	49.91839947702853
they belong to the regiment that was at lens which the prince assigned to the ca	86.80134293957275
ah monsieur said dartagnan as if to sum up in a word all that conversation if on	111.1394662994346
i wish it with all my heart said comminges	20.789392935487108
then if he should forget that visit you would find no inconvenience in reminding	102.87727939021687
not at all	15.271347717148263
ah that gives me more confidence	104.734462941089
this skillful turn of the conversation would have seemed a sublime manoeuvre to 	159.79109741961435
now said dartagnan i ve one last favor to ask of you monsieur de comminges	34.63409726577503
at your service sir	20.02573304609881
you will see the count again	19.011223155034436
tomorrow morning	581.8750652639995
will you remember us to him and ask him to solicit for me the same favor that he	48.42602170303528
you want the cardinal to come here	52.214023815319756
no i know my place and am not so presumptuous	70.12055725845013
let his eminence do me the honor to give me a hearing that is all i want	63.20041112502248
oh muttered porthos shaking his head never should i have thought this of him how	86.12104470713037
i promise you it shall be done answered de comminges	33.76903048416707
tell the count that i am well that you found me sad but resigned	74.04363623298742
i am pleased sir to hear that	55.36412114856554
and the same also for monsieur du vallon	89.15249576882766
not for me cried porthos i am not by any means resigned	31.160901804625112
but you will be resigned my friend	45.04757847430096
he will become so monsieur i know him better than he knows himself	103.58403789279062
be silent dear du vallon and resign yourself	128.4219603401254
adieu gentlemen said de comminges sleep well	113.05449820923768
we will try	24.008722595795092
de comminges went away dartagnan remaining apparently in the same attitude of hu	34.10275509960143
oh cried porthos what s the matter now have you gone mad my dear friend	41.274579081075174
what is the matter returned dartagnan we are saved	20.3563650228226
i do nt see that at all answered porthos	37.51229840188239
i think we are all taken prisoners except aramis and that our chances of getting	149.0040495910131
which is far too strong for two of us but not strong enough for three of us retu	130.9995741881051
i do nt understand said porthos	10.933152515177103
never mind lets sit down to table and take something to strengthen us for the ni	80.65017570045546
what are we to do then tonight	26.812806636517358
to travelperhaps	2321.2093430708405
sit down dear friend to table	70.20533551224813
when one is eating ideas flow easily	1224.223011614885
after supper when they are perfected i will communicate my plans to you	105.16278383569295
so porthos sat down to table without another word and ate with an appetite that 	76.9972746568676
chapter lxxxiv	2.5154182662150117
strength and sagacitycontinued	22.986492683808113
supper was eaten in silence but not in sadness for from time to time one of thos	72.90038872117411
not a scintilla of these was lost on porthos and at every one he uttered an excl	75.55238377766767
at dessert dartagnan reposed in his chair crossed one leg over the other and lou	70.41286124380825
porthos rested his chin on his hands placed his elbows on the table and looked a	46.012055427331035
well said dartagnan at last	27.46612623483252
well repeated porthos	161.43054271091515
you were saying my dear friend	22.398591114894934
no i said nothing	42.35708534835767
yes you were saying you wished to leave this place	70.8499209503003
ah indeed the will was never wanting	288.49468596884145
to get away you would not mind you added knocking down a door or a wall	161.06194084206894
tis truei said so and i say it again	60.14784246355358
and i answered you porthos that it was not a good plan that we could nt go a hun	33.97142090237691
that is true we should need clothes and arms	196.83865747735481
well said dartagnan rising we have them friend porthos and even something better	90.70138715720921
bah said porthos looking around	22.046554644586053
useless to look everything will come to us when wanted	191.9013375130419
at about what time did we see the two swiss guards walking yesterday	220.80368803797498
an hour after sunset	33.47363658993025
if they go out today as they did yesterday we shall have the honor then of seein	60.83903125869178
in a quarter of an hour at most	12.952284013822487
your arm is still strong enough is it not porthos	57.221616831154584
porthos unbuttoned his sleeve raised his shirt and looked complacently on his st	59.892696486255794
yes indeed said he i believe so	31.01455426842245
so that you could without trouble convert these tongs into a hoop and yonder sho	114.20250283164424
and the giant took up these two articles and without any apparent effort produce	165.44980412828897
there he cried	62.58279155333174
capital exclaimed the gascon	42.55999859784481
really porthos you are a gifted individual	72.02002176737825
i have heard speak said porthos of a certain milo of crotona who performed wonde	38.40693121320337
i used to learn all these feat by heart yonder down at pierrefonds and i have do	148.26999192845753
because your strength is not in your head porthos said his friend	49.38029172232375
no it is in my arms and shoulders answered porthos with gratified naivete	92.81583277981514
well my dear friend let us approach the window and there you can match your stre	53.18381749004506
porthos went to the window took a bar in his hands clung to it and bent it like 	51.88092787722101
well friend the cardinal although such a genius could never have done that	122.78874222838414
shall i take out any more of them asked porthos	52.30794719395422
no that is sufficient a man can pass through that	96.53123717468763
porthos tried and passed the upper portion of his body through	63.13998660202257
yes he said	13.467120521395836
now pass your arm through this opening	206.48708445810516
you will know presentlypass it	105.19809220994179
porthos obeyed with military promptness and passed his arm through the opening	110.36794646988535
admirable said dartagnan	6.393318483145363
the scheme goes forward it seems	644.8938266230765
on wheels dear friend	316.8961155411767
good what shall i do now	38.900418936474985
it is finished then	70.16584433853876
no not yet	121.14064762426663
i should like to understand said porthos	39.298063445702844
listen my dear friend in two words you will know all	32.62339592610603
the door of the guardhouse opens as you see	63.02523093048504
yes i see	19.778416070274936
they are about to send into our court which monsieur de mazarin crosses on his w	45.51904143921588
there they are coming out	27.05343896310578
if only they close the guardhouse door good they close it	606.78470304332
what then	81.58782053461947
silence they may hear us	172.19626650164878
i do nt understand it at all	21.560131437073938
as you execute you will understand	83.31283787990176
and yet i should have preferred	83.16693060368772
you will have the pleasure of the surprise	37.92659352363839
ah that is true	11.548354719428797
porthos remained silent and motionless	29.854422287554577
in fact the two soldiers advanced on the side where the window was rubbing their	43.58412646833399
at this moment the door of the guardhouse was opened and one of the soldiers was	11.082117838646973
now said dartagnan i am going to call this soldier and talk to him	32.68593666091058
do nt lose a word of what i m going to say to you porthos	19.801361049295373
everything lies in the execution	258.7640871511522
good the execution of plots is my forte	127.31665164265793
i know it well	20.153537308149485
i depend on you	94.13089535796685
look i shall turn to the left so that the soldier will be at your right as soon 	73.98194573504072
but supposing he does nt mount	142.4714646038391
he will rely upon it	115.70218023022275
as soon as you see him get up stretch out your arm and seize him by the neck	57.56331845037465
then raising him up as tobit raised the fish by the gills you must pull him into	140.22399655213928
oh said porthos	5.384902656336982
suppose i happen to strangle him	111.76311087021026
to be sure there would only be a swiss the less in the world but you will not do	44.05868348762821
lay him down here well gag him and tie himno matter wheresomewhere	457.3507541763188
so we shall get from him one uniform and a sword	85.44143358054441
marvelous exclaimed porthos looking at the gascon with the most profound admirat	17.491721546856702
pooh replied dartagnan	5.211143917961648
yes said porthos recollecting himself but one uniform and one sword will not suf	92.37443806168832
well but there s his comrade	262.60801903502113
true said porthos	3.9226208535478593
therefore when i cough stretch out your arm	396.50699079486833
the two friends then placed themselves as they had agreed porthos being complete	80.2233978480213
goodevening comrade said dartagnan in his most fascinating voice and manner	50.12418240499132
goodevening sir answered the soldier in a strong provincial accent	44.34456005119679
tis not too warm to walk resumed dartagnan	165.96229372209567
no sir	40.392414823952656
and i think a glass of wine will not be disagreeable to you	23.494383858691364
a glass of wine will be extremely welcome	55.074143642152016
the fish bitesthe fish bites whispered the gascon to porthos	123.57900930507617
i understand said porthos	21.384903972093973
a bottle perhaps	782.3573096921536
a whole bottle yes sir	406.79538439965603
a whole bottle if you will drink my health	174.39986320181322
willingly answered the soldier	120.87441583649657
come then and take it friend said the gascon	53.094498505135874
with all my heart	37.47646945878302
how convenient that there s a bench here	209.44175998454153
egad one would think it had been placed here on purpose	121.9254236681523
get on it that s it friend	132.6994498891398
and dartagnan coughed	194.69464336493877
that instant the arm of porthos fell	74.93215892995751
his hand of iron grasped quick as lightning firm as a pair of blacksmiths pincer	91.94338436979167
he raised him almost stifling him as he drew him through the aperture at the ris	63.740062506862024
he then laid him down on the floor where dartagnan after giving him just time en	121.08820893638871
then the soldier gagged and bound was placed upon the hearth the fire of which h	97.64723034057792
heres a sword and a dress said porthos	65.06165815407451
i take them said dartagnan for myself	43.54741920245821
if you want another uniform and sword you must play the same trick over again	194.536141228866
stop i see the other soldier issue from the guardroom and come toward us	136.63388722325345
i think replied porthos it would be imprudent to attempt the same manoeuvre agai	36.044540891568964
no i will go down seize the man unawares and bring him to you ready gagged	114.84903057553082
that is better said the gascon	20.599644119548607
be ready said porthos as he slipped through the opening	38.230107210162565
he did as he said	77.19796381328244
porthos seized his opportunity caught the next soldier by his neck gagged him an	208.5020043067789
then they undressed him as they had done the first laid him on their bed and bou	45.27360146303635
this operation proved as great a success as the first	220.4749099228307
there said dartagnan this is capital now let me try on the dress of yonder chap	63.590488861739686
porthos i doubt if you can wear it but should it be too tight never mind you can	99.74208456505865
it happened however that the second soldier was a swiss of gigantic proportions 	86.35650829177479
they then dressed themselves	385.82679301130037
tis done they both exclaimed at once	445.66047698611277
as to you comrades they said to the men nothing will happen to you if you are di	138.0358728266468
the soldiers were complaisant they had found the grasp of porthos pretty powerfu	86.50256647334105
now said dartagnan you would nt be sorry to understand the plot would you portho	31.57946346716243
well no not very	387.2973533237832
well then we shall go down into the court	20.308533443599362
we shall take the place of those two fellows	32.53383070776513
we will walk back and forth	158.95325914236926
that s a good idea for it is nt warm	38.46415880906937
in a moment the valetdechambre will call the guard as he did yesterday and the d	90.05242134396615
and we shall answer	81.13340693399181
no on the contrary we shall not answer	18.353360455563653
as you please i do nt insist on answering	87.64693739569739
we will not answer then we will simply settle our hats on our heads and we will 	53.24966747570299
where shall we escort him	162.22797665257963
where he is goingto visit athos	133.13086959454694
do you think athos will be sorry to see us	16.457444238463783
oh cried porthos oh i understand	17.26958821952437
wait a little porthos before crying out for on my word you have nt reached the e	148.39405272710087
what is to happen said porthos	18.853821074518642
follow me replied dartagnan	8.062831328053257
the man who lives to see shall see	123.3942344546318
and slipping through the aperture he alighted in the court	71.38691339790157
porthos followed him by the same road but with more difficulty and less diligenc	72.43240691688648
they could hear the two soldiers shivering with fear as they lay bound in the ch	59.73104226698036
scarcely had the two frenchmen touched the ground when a door opened and the voi	38.66088285883412
make ready	16663.768461611955
at the same moment the guardhouse was opened and a voice called out	31.517582017132934
la bruyere and du barthois march	75.99043022345954
it seems that i am named la bruyere remarked dartagnan	40.58396165048699
and i du barthois added porthos	70.9303722150434
where are you asked the valetdechambre whose eyes dazzled by the light could not	51.28781860869408
here we are said the gascon	18.081168756296982
what say you to that monsieur du vallon he added in a low tone to porthos	18.223337389117173
if it but lasts most capital responded porthos	403.8397122317832
these two newly enlisted soldiers marched gravely after the valetdechambre who o	194.67654086667673
your orders are very simple he said do nt allow anybody except one person to ent	112.68399992732708
do you hearnot a single creature obey that person implicitly	315.4904638835399
on your return you can not make a mistake	29.192180734542656
you have only to wait here till i release you	78.70681991680219
dartagnan was known to this valetdechambre who was no other than bernouin and he	61.550547128370404
the gascon therefore instead of answering growled out ja ja in the most german a	70.42421066678826
as for porthos on whom dartagnan had impressed the necessity of absolute silence	71.89015519787009
all that he was allowed to say in case of emergencies was the proverbial der teu	42.34081944071987
bernouin shut the door and went away	38.41116194600239
when porthos heard the key turn in the lock he began to be alarmed lest they sho	47.24293169947147
porthos my friend said dartagnan do nt distrust providence let me meditate and c	104.69047391057217
meditate and consider as much as you like replied porthos who was now quite out 	57.85583491399099
we have walked eight paces whispered dartagnan and gone up six steps so hereabou	145.97378455296524
the comte de la fere can not be far off only the doors are locked	48.980582333271855
that is a slight difficulty said porthos and a good push with the shoulders	86.95217521130989
for gods sake porthos my friend reserve your feats of strength or they will not 	93.49938018932511
have you not heard that some one is coming here	38.98937098466323
well that some one will open the doors	153.68190736454227
but my dear fellow if that some one recognizes us if that some one cries out we 	108.57791782833002
that might do if we were dealing with englishmen or germans	46.910893171225005
oh may god keep me from it and you too said dartagnan	58.74048468471453
the young king would perhaps show us some gratitude but the queen would never fo	130.1489447516497
and then besides the useless blood never no never i have my plan let me carry it	222.18864715523347
so much the better said porthos i feel some need of it	22.115514652676403
hush said dartagnan the some one is coming	48.25308854153266
the sound of a light step was heard in the vestibule	51.421767200847135
the hinges of the door creaked and a man appeared in the dress of a cavalier wra	25.101325567670134
porthos effaced himself against the wall but he could not render himself invisib	57.05922674943598
light the lamp which hangs from the ceiling	89.24870803285913
then addressing dartagnan	210.50777549046205
you know the watchword he said	26.679703877677206
ja replied the gascon determined to confine himself to this specimen of the germ	62.40262785457412
tedesco answered the cavalier va bene	77.50258412074281
and advancing toward the door opposite to that by which he came in he opened it 	99.58231348439253
now asked porthos what are we to do	18.44792321540248
now we shall make use of your shoulder friend porthos if this door proves to be 	89.86612441246973
everything in its proper time and all comes right to those who know how to wait 	206.28130570855933
but first barricade the first door well then we will follow yonder cavalier	361.74506106560364
the two friends set to work and crowded the space before the door with all the f	39.989321704624686
there said dartagnan we ca nt be overtaken	19.237256851502153
come forward	929.3496626104649
chapter lxxxv	2.4345495408483715
the oubliettes of cardinal mazarin	101.51667242618824
at first on arriving at the door through which mazarin had passed dartagnan trie	29.647232214609797
the bolt gave way and the door opened	78.3715643985542
as i told you everything can be attained porthos women and doors by proceeding w	164.64775981907826
you re a great moralist and that s the fact said porthos	61.81564421507074
they entered behind a glass window by the light of the cardinals lantern which h	62.13445054709041
no cardinal said dartagnan but only his lantern where the devil then is he	128.27734030703934
exploring however one of the side wings of the gallery after making a sign to po	53.680144998127105
ten men would have found difficulty in moving that tub but by some mechanical co	107.59562773964915
dartagnan as we have said perceived a hole in that place and in this hole the st	52.520700642321096
he called porthos to look at it	36.95165065778585
were our object money only he said we should be rich directly	234.43952515632364
how s that	93.07044379300477
do nt you understand porthos at the bottom of that staircase lies probably the c	65.22321327000552
it would be a happy hit for clowns to make but as it seems to be unworthy of two	72.29300584182737
so i think and therefore i said were our object money only but we want something	211.79421917585927
at the same moment whilst dartagnan was leaning over the aperture to listen a me	69.95020703672024
mazarin had left his lamp in the gallery to make people believe that he was walk	75.01828301035643
faith he said in italian as he was reascending the steps and looking at a bag of	33.52534377576743
i am a great captainthat i am but i make war in my own way	48.36019846979365
the two friends were crouching down meantime behind a tub in the side alley	82.93359900047611
mazarin came within three steps of dartagnan and pushed a spring in the wall the	54.53432491924293
then the cardinal put out the waxlight slipped it into his pocket and taking up 	49.17163039577533
very good thought dartagnan tis our road likewise we will go together	106.9743731026744
all three set off on their walk mazarin taking the middle alley and the friends 	58.673607740060795
the cardinal reached a second door without perceiving he was being followed the 	168.74591581670694
he then turned to the left down a corridor which had escaped the attention of th	42.13696197001011
ah diavolo he exclaimed i forgot the recommendation of de comminges who advised 	44.550631523231786
and with a movement of impatience he turned to retrace his steps	67.34719666022781
do not give yourself the trouble my lord said dartagnan with his right foot forw	31.68482833861636
yeshere we are said porthos	36.85276805823813
and he made the same friendly salute as dartagnan	69.90755917966308
mazarin gazed at each of them with an affrighted stare recognized them and let d	51.91526425611286
dartagnan picked it up by good luck it had not been extinguished	92.79848525029512
oh what imprudence my lord said dartagnan tis not good to be about just here wit	113.73335051384862
your eminence might knock against something or fall into a hole	220.36444531352814
monsieur dartagnan muttered mazarin unable to recover from his astonishment	47.763749153442326
yes my lord it is i	13.838265145208625
i have the honor to present to you monsieur du vallon that excellent friend of m	29.89080953459708
and dartagnan held the lamp before the merry face of porthos who now began to co	51.82219423744588
you were going to visit monsieur de la fere said dartagnan	15.939658869394668
do nt let us disarrange your eminence	27.179565942121442
be so good as to show us the way and we will follow you	29.499714313028164
mazarin was by degrees recovering his senses	93.54999670104874
have you been long in the orangery he asked in a trembling voice remembering the	32.446708305054216
porthos opened his mouth to reply dartagnan made him a sign and his mouth remain	50.85316904256128
this moment come my lord said dartagnan	29.550728551979393
mazarin breathed again	913.4109407732484
his fears were now no longer for his hoard but for himself	96.75847657827084
a sort of smile played on his lips	59.83472110675879
come he said you have me in a snare gentlemen	46.01305371988828
i confess myself conquered	540.6503517126366
you wish to ask for liberty andi give it you	76.3705414170106
oh my lord answered dartagnan you are too good as to our liberty we have that we	28.916263899305193
you have your liberty repeated mazarin in terror	127.27865328590985
certainly and on the other hand my lord you have lost it and now in accordance w	41.01019506342604
mazarin felt a shiver run through hima chill even to his hearts core	217.27898951689028
his piercing look was fixed in vain on the satirical face of the gascon and the 	36.413209329417384
both were in shadow and the sybil of cuma herself could not have read them	86.33485138404629
to purchase back my liberty said the cardinal	111.91098956239128
yes my lord	5.948334913050461
and how much will that cost me monsieur dartagnan	94.11397519290333
zounds my lord i do nt know yet	33.0133728685086
we must ask the comte de la fere the question	18.399920851699672
will your eminence deign to open the door which leads to the counts room and in 	30.321394481929165
mazarin started	330.1689244937332
my lord said dartagnan your eminence sees that we wish to act with all formality	51.62628800076484
be assured answered mazarin that i shall attempt nothing i give you my word of h	37.58860245110215
dartagnan made a sign to porthos to redouble his watchfulness then turning to ma	40.77372395549151
now my lord let us enter if you please	27.09629470350437
chapter lxxxvi	2.564167998511542
mazarin turned the lock of a double door on the threshold of which they found at	38.8804836937037
on perceiving mazarin he bowed	32.63949262697442
your eminence he said might have dispensed with your attendants the honor bestow	188.70037982819156
and so my dear count said dartagnan his eminence did nt actually insist on our a	69.8324968294119
at that voice that mocking tone and that familiar gesture accenting voice and to	364.3598072846927
dartagnan porthos he exclaimed	41.18274043303447
my very self dear friend	102.46647532186691
me also repeated porthos	184.35955441069797
what means this asked the count	65.93215701715044
it means replied mazarin trying to smile and biting his lips in the attempt that	56.81320015551953
ah my lord cried the gascon do nt threaten tis a bad example	50.53897147176045
we are so good and gentle to your eminence	35.43573065470916
come let us put aside all rancor and talk pleasantly	101.49552080529448
there s nothing i wish more replied mazarin	64.63099014195213
but do nt think yourselves in a better position than you are	59.592410702673284
in ensnaring me you have fallen into the trap yourselves	201.99670409776832
how are you to get away from here remember the soldiers and sentinels who guard 	100.48330059368332
now i am going to show you how sincere i am	35.61342499656174
good thought dartagnan we must look about us he s going to play us a trick	83.75313572109688
i offered you your liberty continued the minister will you take it before an hou	72.56328764239157
he is right thought athos	63.351060959092486
and like every other reflection passing in a mind that entertained none but nobl	232.15435582452923
and therefore said dartagnan to clip the hope which athoss tacit adhesion had im	94.43719487007155
if on the contrary resumed mazarin you accept your liberty	49.122955374137334
why you my lord might take it away from us in less than five minutes afterward a	66.37307778147913
noon the faith of a cardinal	67.75385426461325
you do not believe me	11.412095322689522
my lord i never believe cardinals who are not priests	186.89642393203067
well on the faith of a minister	61.48044156826793
you are no longer a minister my lord you are a prisoner	31.157974782959844
then on the honor of a mazarin as i am and ever shall be i hope said the cardina	35.11251953534318
hem replied dartagnan	13.787874532794328
i have heard speak of a mazarin who had not much religion when his oaths were in	55.312164592575364
i fear he may have been an ancestor of your eminence	55.316991409023444
monsieur dartagnan you are a great wit and i am really sorry to be on bad terms 	35.690571863238475
my lord let us come to terms i ask nothing better	75.64701172103184
very well said mazarin if i place you in security in a manner evident palpable	87.91264330718398
ah that is another thing said porthos	12.745474502580521
let us see said athos	6.141436719500889
let us see said dartagnan	5.968115365242333
in the first place do you accept asked the cardinal	29.90182917199029
unfold your plan my lord and we will see	47.30910655541388
take notice that you are shut upcaptured	245.78542624570525
you well know my lord that there always remains to us a last resource	89.40383565369444
that of dying together	2770.9412654458715
mazarin shuddered	342.6573461518971
listen he said at the end of yonder corridor is a door of which i have the key i	45.554890784980095
go and take this key with you you are active vigorous and you have arms	83.49478572520299

ah by jove my lord said dartagnan you have well said but these are only words	64.52416928540647

ah my lord you will conduct us yourself then to that door	81.70749944290432
very willingly if it be necessary to reassure you answered the minister and maza	42.4104603680631
it led into the park as the three fugitives perceived by the night breeze which 	80.68271688613903
the devil exclaimed the gascon tis a dreadful night my lord	45.88948517174454
we do nt know the locality and shall never find the wall	55.247741894346426
since your eminence has come so far come a few steps further conduct us my lord 	97.3395698627352
be it so replied the cardinal and walking in a straight line he went to the wall	32.16701483740733
are you satisfied gentlemen asked mazarin	15.317187048619008
i think so indeed we should be hard to please if we were not	41.695289655392045
deuce take it three poor gentlemen escorted by a prince of the church ah apropos	216.19115773567742
you are mistaken	18.52178666367895
monsieur du vallon and i are the only two who are armed	62.2760558052788
the count is not and should we meet with one of your patrol we must defend ourse	79.81410026270547
tis true	3.19799364516274
where can we find another sword asked porthos	83.16256843897803
my lord said dartagnan will lend his which is of no use to him to the comte de l	54.09552714528137
willingly said the cardinal i will even ask the count to keep it for my sake	39.72738273536232
i promise you my lord never to part with it replied athos	53.63019072314821
well well cried dartagnan this reconciliation is truly touching have you not tea	128.66026815426903
yes said porthos but i do not know if it is feeling or the wind that makes me we	33.74293064983816
now climb up athos quickly said dartagnan	64.24163616291001
athos assisted by porthos who lifted him up like a feather arrived at the top	112.01712613729732
now jump down athos	192.9103605490058
athos jumped and disappeared on the other side of the wall	22.191001326231124
are you on the ground asked dartagnan	16.373334369530305
without accident	2491.870370562607
perfectly safe and sound	1050.1671453670097
porthos whilst i get up watch the cardinal	217.27898951689028
no i do nt want your help watch the cardinal	43.11489677951401
i am watching said porthos	51.057655973475406
you are right it is more difficult than i thought	24.238811781084884
lend me your backbut do nt let the cardinal go	38.838764049756364
porthos lent him his back and dartagnan was soon on the summit of the wall where	39.523139879431916
mazarin pretended to laugh	64.35780875417743
are you there asked porthos	13.967897562513608
yes my friend and now	26.324352492979042
now what asked porthos	26.911729873019418
now give me the cardinal up here if he makes any noise stifle him	112.72199479769444
mazarin wished to call out but porthos held him tight and passed him to dartagna	66.57635442626922
sir jump directly down close to monsieur de la fere or on the honor of a gentlem	36.65725549307701
monsieur monsieur cried mazarin you are breaking your word to me	31.08076075788332
idid i promise you anything my lord	52.49616343068391
mazarin groaned	341.3885133054867
you are free he said through me your liberty was my ransom	92.33819402828992
agreed but the ransom of that immense treasure buried under the gallery to which	171.02796933254155
diavolo cried mazarin almost choked and clasping his hands i am a lost and ruine	41.37580560491336
but without listening to his protestations of alarm dartagnan slipped him gently	214.891429846662
porthos next made an effort which shook the solid wall and by the aid of his fri	56.30756822197805
i did nt understand it all he said but i understand now how droll it is	47.71627439417385
you think so so much the better but that it may prove laughterworthy even to the	62.46791665556638
and he jumped off the wall	50.686901508957924
porthos did the same	54.18071685291005
attend to monsieur le cardinal gentlemen said dartagnan for myself i will reconn	33.277583581666235
the gascon then drew his sword and marched as avant guard	120.5874920506942
my lord he said which way do we go think well of your reply for should your emin	145.42486439789724
along the wall sir said mazarin there will be no danger of losing yourselves	73.01167598229709
the three friends hastened on but in a short time were obliged to slacken the pa	49.2404833689318
the cardinal could not keep up with them though with every wish to do so	86.39971481048582
suddenly dartagnan touched something warm which moved	712.8082403858782
stop a horse he cried i have found a horse	50.368110844177
and i likewise said athos	44.32329314765151
i too said porthos who faithful to the instructions still held the cardinals arm	153.5731964663674
there s luck my lord just as you were complaining of being tired and obliged to 	77.86641839533043
but as he spoke the barrel of a pistol was presented at his breast and these wor	35.856188436342194
touch it not	303.3975590633759
grimaud he cried grimaud what art thou about why thou art posted here by heaven	193.1568586265079
no sir said the honest servant it was monsieur aramis who posted me here to take	61.96890273516237
is aramis here	177.4209168940011
yes sir he has been here since yesterday	61.30529294972417
what are you doing	5.696953643165696
on the watch	82.91517269487403
what aramis here cried athos	77.50372976868118
at the lesser gate of the castle he s posted there	61.74455953957595
are you a large party	45.55758442543219
let him know	54.98070615503521
this moment sir	111.81348391863507
and believing that no one could execute the commission better than himself grima	181.6585610954491
there was no one in the whole group in a bad humor except cardinal mazarin	44.11837842844793
chapter lxxxvii	2.7097707055788534
thinking that porthos will be at last a baron and dartagnan a captain	46.12785897973227
at the expiration of ten minutes aramis arrived accompanied by grimaud and eight	25.173645988807635
he was excessively delighted and threw himself into his friends arms	82.31803095287182
you are free my brothers free without my aid and i shall have succeeded in doing	68.32583732399085
do not be unhappy dear friend on that account if you have done nothing as yet yo	50.24840655356428
i had well concerted my plans pursued aramis the coadjutor gave me sixty men twe	109.92628756008767
thus i was able thanks to the strategic disposition of my forces to intercept tw	87.97067975620749
mazarin listened intently	1003.4454442930291
but said dartagnan i trust that you honorably sent them back to monsieur le card	53.79578723459434
ah yes said aramis toward him i should be very likely to practice such delicacy 	65.0861405501923
in the other he announces that he is about to transport his prisoners to melun s	45.76064028859902
you can understand dear friend with what hope i was inspired by that last letter	135.4591269348191
i placed myself in ambuscade with my sixty men i encircled the castle the riding	134.82965990126883
you are free tonight without fighting so much the better how did you manage to e	73.47457095952103
not very much said dartagnan	22.66343451540752
i might even say that we have some reason to praise him	87.64288353774444
yes really it is owing to him that we are free	49.49332568193016
owing to him	13.798776191614357
yes he had us conducted into the orangery by monsieur bernouin his valetdechambr	133.1829983107196
then he offered us our liberty and we accepted it	74.31199373328056
he even went so far as to show us the way out he led us to the park wall which w	83.17728174642018
well exclaimed aramis this will reconcile me to him but i wish he were here that	52.178581686060085
my lord said dartagnan no longer able to contain himself allow me to introduce t	45.096999650407795
and he retired discovering mazarin who was in great confusion to the astonished 	72.68716057275272
ho ho exclaimed the latter the cardinal a glorious prize halloo halloo friends t	124.45919948755808
several horsemen ran quickly to him	115.90992017660594
zounds cried aramis i may have done some good so my lord deign to receive my mos	60.64349754351284
i think it will be wise to set off said dartagnan	19.242316447695515
yes but i am expecting some one a friend of athos	65.93781626244495
a friend exclaimed the count	33.530851449794696
and here he comes by jupiter galloping through the bushes	103.90960192512394
the count the count cried a young voice that made athos start	105.87130923884618
raoul raoul he ejaculated	138.8892977148459
for one moment the young man forgot his habitual respecthe threw himself on his 	47.66442598846644
look my lord cardinal said aramis would it not have been a pity to have separate	37.27226246426617
he will indeed give us the favor of his company you will i hope be grateful for 	75.92805905917427
aramis then joined athos and dartagnan who were consulting together	68.67140783572016
come said dartagnan after a conference of five minutes duration let us begin our	40.50736164073097
where are we to go asked porthos	12.041275560204292
to your house dear porthos at pierrefonds your fine chateau is worthy of affordi	80.03018296291165
come my lord you shall be treated like a prince as you are	41.683590820296175
a fallen prince exclaimed mazarin piteously	429.64967246880246
the chances of war said athos are many but be assured we shall take no improper 	111.13098735452088
no but we shall make use of them said dartagnan	21.65019781194262
the rest of the night was employed by these cavaliers in traveling with the wond	39.67887914152963
mazarin still sombre and pensive permitted himself to be dragged along in this w	113.18535611209276
at dawn twelve leagues had been passed without drawing rein half the escort were	379.9929291742337
horses nowadays are not what they were formerly observed porthos everything dege	148.7874316136549
i have sent grimaud to dammartin said aramis	15.830460270789956
he is to bring us five fresh horsesone for his eminence four for us	142.3319930120852
we at least must keep close to monseigneur the rest of the start will rejoin us 	192.90658912591957
once beyond saint denis we shall have nothing to fear	82.52829882711846
grimaud in fact brought back five horses	681.9915457496564
the nobleman to whom he applied being a friend of porthos was very ready not to 	102.52463501051851
ten minutes later the escort stopped at ermenonville but the four friends went o	19.37259731701988
at noon they rode into the avenue of pierrefonds	36.616175386661
ah said mousqueton who had ridden by the side of dartagnan without speaking a wo	30.572259929114733
we are four of us said dartagnan we must relieve each other in mounting guard ov	36.64513543510185
athos is going to examine the castle which it will be necessary to render impreg	26.933130176139024
that is to say athos will be chief engineer porthos purveyoringeneral and aramis	63.91567522880214
meanwhile they gave up to mazarin the handsomest room in the chateau	53.399229453208896
gentlemen he said when he was in his room you do not expect i presume to keep me	32.46771806751393
no my lord replied the gascon on the contrary we think of announcing very soon t	36.10068416755888
then you will be besieged	44.33133574213203
we expect it	214.67676375215993
and what shall you do	14.07862054717279
defend ourselves	7037.074113649956
were the late cardinal richelieu alive he would tell you a certain story of the 	100.66966767891239
such feats sir are done onceand never repeated	1727.3451868526265
however nowadays there s no need of so much heroism	103.58339578944336
tomorrow the army of paris will be summoned the day after it will be here the fi	33.10004384265312
the prince will vanquish you as he has always done	60.3428426486802
tis possible my lord but before an engagement ensues we shall move your eminence	108.054042189571
we will not expose your eminence to the chances of war	34.22566063447349
come answered mazarin i see it will be necessary for me to capitulate	24.391410297336844
before a siege	335.9784829726048
yes the conditions will be better than afterward	77.62989150266608
ah my lord as to conditions you would soon see how moderate and reasonable we ar	104.37580086922412
come now what are your conditions	59.510544017668714
rest yourself first my lord and wewe will reflect	193.92866533076972
i do not need rest gentlemen i need to know whether i am among enemies or friend	162.8932088628187
friends my lord friends	77.71859742158284
well then tell me at once what you want that i may see if any arrangement be pos	42.50770218851329
speak comte de la fere	40.895985890974636
my lord replied athos for myself i have nothing to demand	25.13307010693393
for france were i to specify my wishes i should have too much	75.11883249231924
i beg you to excuse me and propose to the chevalier	43.96372107524255
and athos bowing retired and remained leaning against the mantelpiece a spectato	151.30700995774612
speak then chevalier said the cardinal	43.11412583197472
what do you want nothing ambiguous if you please	35.386071191519584
be clear short and precise	376.9009863370356
as for me replied aramis i have in my pocket the very programme of the condition	24.397319424233075
let us consider first the ancient rights	460.22227332243165
the demands in that programme must be granted	188.70793824520518
we were almost agreed on those replied mazarin let us pass on to private and per	147.98872908421927
you suppose then that there are some said aramis smiling	62.53962536173161
i do not suppose that you will all be quite so disinterested as monsieur de la f	32.3606756041262
my lord you are right and i am glad to see that you do justice to the count at l	19.590074428003124
the count has a mind above vulgar desires and earthly passions	303.3343443224272
he is a proud soulhe is a man by himself you are righthe is worth us all and we 	112.5935516964526
aramis said athos are you jesting	40.45543648292366
no no dear friend i state only what we all know	252.84625112859518
you are right it is not you alone this matter concerns but my lord and his unwor	53.90130678354594
well then what do you require besides the general conditions before recited	152.56463883581864
i require my lord that normandy should be given to madame de longueville with fi	30.58964912517253
i require that his majesty should deign to be godfather to the child she has jus	61.7022363113411
that is you wish me to lay aside my ministerial functions to quit france and be 	76.91001548425149
i wish his eminence to become pope on the first opportunity allowing me then the	134.3389798885442
mazarin made a grimace which was quite indescribable and then turned to dartagna	35.51110406029689
and you sir he said	30.19917187707857
i my lord answered the gascon i differ from monsieur dherblay entirely as to the	63.47518681665794
far from wishing my lord to quit paris i hope he will stay there and continue to	77.39404617930022
i shall try also to help him to down the fronde but on one conditionthat he some	106.11122524434793
and you monsieur du vallon	18.312313454696937
yes you sir speak if you please said mazarin	48.62857406227952
as for me answered porthos i wish my lord cardinal in order to do honor to my ho	37.932426323037845
you know sir that before receiving the order one must submit proofs	339.4982770661671
my friends will submit them	72.28549133826327
besides should it be necessary monseigneur will show him how that formality may 	162.23664079260027
mazarin bit his lips the blow was direct and he replied rather dryly	130.97340377284658
all this appears to me to be ill conceived disjointed gentlemen for if i satisfy	92.02527387094624
if i stay in paris i can not go to rome if i became pope i could not continue to	47.48789445141178
true said aramis so as i am in a minority i withdraw my proposition so far as it	45.65854771290872
i am to remain minister then said mazarin	68.60931850692688
you remain minister that is understood said dartagnan france needs you	112.84983106628061
and i desist from my pretensions said aramis	73.67422823336283
his eminence will continue to be prime minister and her majestys favorite if he 	133.87746918197942
occupy yourselves with your own affairs gentlemen and let france settle matters 	358.5599296141783
ho ho replied aramis	10.32950711548296
the frondeurs will have a treaty and your eminence must sign it before us promis	85.17994719877696
i can answer only for myself said mazarin	39.55900142462513
i can not answer for the queen	19.483018083133814
suppose her majesty refuses	65.13923288117968
oh said dartagnan monseigneur knows very well that her majesty refuses him nothi	72.26905177718979
here monseigneur said aramis is the treaty proposed by the deputation of frondeu	70.50841465320086
will your eminence please read and examine	256.46294640335134
i am acquainted with it	79.97723251283145
sign it then	35.099805564126456
reflect gentlemen that a signature given under circumstances like the present mi	264.91022702668164
monseigneur will be at hand to testify that it was freely given	121.32852734422383
suppose i refuse	145.24835249212768
then said dartagnan your eminence must expect the consequences of a refusal	51.240530410910985
would you dare to touch a cardinal	95.2680055475265
you have dared my lord to imprison her majestys musketeers	108.53748987378604
the queen will revenge me gentlemen	138.24006767270404
i do not think so although inclination might lead her to do so but we shall take	88.21839338873032
how uneasy they must be at this moment at rueil and saint germain said aramis	34.62810290327804
how they must be asking where is the cardinal what has become of the minister wh	77.77865638217217
it is frightful murmured mazarin	24.983764511942805
sign the treaty then monseigneur said aramis	117.82464548625359
suppose the queen should refuse to ratify it	80.41681078652161
ah nonsense cried dartagnan i can manage so that her majesty will receive me wel	40.826729270209896
i shall take her majesty the letter in which you tell her that the finances are 	68.73535598626339
and then asked mazarin turning pale	36.493898439239295
when i see her majesty embarrassed i shall conduct her to rueil make her enter t	93.32606476017078
enough sir muttered the cardinal you have said enough where is the treaty	61.50680244498901
here it is replied aramis	16.255241847272533
sign my lord and he gave him a pen	31.215175752721688
mazarin arose walked some moments thoughtful but not dejected	470.80308410854013
and when i have signed he said what is to be my guarantee	53.65638373396987
my word of honor sir said athos	18.42162678097333
mazarin started turned toward the comte de la fere and looking for an instant at	29.20628501612434
it is sufficient count he said and signed the treaty	127.82720584609365
and now monsieur dartagnan he said prepare to set off for saint germain and take	55.14730392451622

shows how with threat and pen more is effected than by the sword	299.8447117939319
dartagnan knew his part well he was aware that opportunity has a forelock only f	164.0592811266802
he soon arranged a prompt and certain manner of traveling by sending relays of h	167.36758942833035
but before setting out he reflected that for a lad of intelligence and experienc	116.49498941725321
in fact he said as he was about to mount and start on his dangerous mission atho	68.71824926687164
what will come out of those three elements when i am no longer present to combin	37.96187530186613
now the deliverance of the cardinal would be the ruin of our hopes and our hopes	47.21778679111393
he went to find aramis	37.21742044536057
you my dear chevalier dherblay he said are the fronde incarnate	86.54167807351045
mistrust athos therefore who will not prosecute the affairs of any one even his 	124.18425330720741
mistrust porthos especially who to please the count whom he regards as god on ea	173.96108005924992
aramis smiled his smile was at once cunning and resolute	84.800821733268
fear nothing he said i have my conditions to impose	82.45340555672851
my private ambition tends only to the profit of him who has justice on his side	190.6323417301029
good thought dartagnan in this direction i am satisfied	54.032250949507855
he pressed aramiss hand and went in search of porthos	45.64263537938099
friend he said you have worked so hard with me toward building up our fortune th	156.0855215046107
what should you say if either of these two friends proposed to you to let mazari	66.22411440001973
why i should say that we had too much trouble in taking him to let him off so ea	57.10906627734166
bravo porthos and you would be right my friend for in losing him you would lose 	82.33483264997757
do you think so	7.373153739730301
i am sure of it	7.810019995635049
then i would kill him rather than let him go	70.89155491227362
and you would act rightly	260.1070638731732
there is no question you understand provided we secure our own interests of secu	91.04062259218531
never fear dear friend said porthos	42.05422215209835
i shall see you through the window as you mount your horse i shall follow you wi	38.52664274703797
i shall see everything and at the least suspicious sign i shall begin to extermi	96.46470119736466
bravo thought dartagnan on this side i think the cardinal will be well guarded	57.02658653732719
he pressed the hand of the lord of pierrefonds and went in search of athos	29.078572260086602
my dear athos he said i am going away	14.069449934610509
i have only one thing to say to you	14.078798448346232
you know anne of austria the captivity of mazarin alone guarantees my life if yo	38.85877054797657
i needed nothing less than that consideration my dear dartagnan to persuade myse	129.16383020606696
i give you my word that you will find the cardinal where you leave him	26.936809865975064
this reassures me more than all the royal signatures thought dartagnan	127.84171342654598
now that i have the word of athos i can set out	24.538094407276713
dartagnan started alone on his journey without other escort than his sword and w	101.59323262417963
six hours after he left pierrefonds he was at saint germain	24.928881263246755
the disappearance of mazarin was not as yet generally known	66.91735223242036
anne of austria was informed of it and concealed her uneasiness from every one	54.96172843624002
in the chamber of dartagnan and porthos the two soldiers had been found bound an	42.18206354483671
on recovering the use of their limbs and tongues they could of course tell nothi	82.46016833183803
but as to what had been done by porthos and dartagnan afterward they were as ign	39.98489808178487
bernouin alone knew a little more than the others	78.59007464920302
bernouin seeing that his master did not return and hearing the stroke of midnigh	51.95114683011716
the first door barricaded with furniture had aroused in him certain suspicions b	359.9864661686737
then he came to the corridor all the doors of which he found open so too was the	71.12545608512715
from the latter point it was easy to follow tracks on the snow	88.87346456249328
he saw that these tracks tended toward the wall on the other side he found simil	37.567942171406884
he could no longer cherish any doubt that the cardinal had been carried off by t	40.49458650849057
anne had enforced the utmost secrecy and had disclosed the event to no one excep	77.67732453030365
now since dartagnan did not constitute a body of horsemen since he was alone sin	86.62734799628674
on entering the courtyard of the old chateau the first person seen by our ambass	73.60122788617845
at the sight of dartagnan who entered the courtyard on horseback bernouin rubbed	29.3104745786492
but dartagnan made a friendly sign to him with his head dismounted and throwing 	46.14640489423878
monsieur dartagnan cried the latter like a man who has the nightmare and talks i	48.96631404149767
himself monsieur bernouin	55.62880132105935
and why have you come here	32.501447226086356
to bring news of monsieur de mazarinthe freshest news there is	78.86580866388816
what has become of him then	16.248472668352996
he is as well as you and i	17.791605070764668
nothing bad has happened to him then	72.21166326681846
absolutely nothing	810.0854532894913
he felt the need of making a trip in the ile de france and begged usthe comte de	53.46005635495754
we were too devoted servants to refuse him a request of that sort	148.18411552787128
we set out last evening and here we are	61.92908338026266
here you are	22.6839334119429
his eminence had something to communicate to her majesty something secret and pr	89.63609247210572
and therefore my dear monsieur bernouin if you wish to do what will be pleasing 	34.70895717782308
whether he spoke seriously or in jest since it was evident that under existing c	88.92043198135185
dartagnan approached the sovereign with every mark of profound respect and havin	90.69489992045908
it was however merely a letter of introduction	87.85208974949752
the queen read it recognized the writing and since there were no details in it o	97.12032003495533
dartagnan related everything with that simple and ingenuous air which he knew ho	161.05003723265511
the queen as he went on looked at him with increasing astonishment	43.1797570865124
she could not comprehend how a man could conceive such an enterprise and still l	56.212574218271875
how sir she cried as dartagnan finished you dare to tell me the details of your 	65.82299729566193
pardon madame but i think that either i have expressed myself badly or your maje	100.57888688681614
there is here no question of crime or treason	119.7581509525867
monsieur de mazarin held us in prison monsieur du vallon and myself because we c	60.96730483820604
brotherinlaw of the late king your husband the consort of madame henrietta your 	115.37003134352204
we were then convinced my friend and i that there was some error of which we wer	85.8488405191361
now that an explanation may bear fruit it is necessary that it should be quietly	107.15627391668534
we have therefore taken away monsieur le cardinal to my friends chateau and ther	69.63365406140564
well madame it proved to be as we had supposed there was a mistake	128.03467437100352
monsieur de mazarin had thought that we had rendered service to general cromwell	51.09301887849133
we were able to prove the contrary and that proof we are ready to give to your m	73.69429054255673
that proof satisfied him so completely that as a sign of satisfaction he has sen	164.8509123464705
i listen to you and i wonder at you sir said the queen	34.39877142072979
in fact i have rarely seen such excess of impudence	94.48322793498188
your majesty on your side said dartagnan is as much mistaken as to our intention	50.809334207095596
you are in error sir answered the queen	28.418596939272735
i am so little mistaken that in ten minutes you shall be arrested and in an hour	47.604529471083374
i am sure your majesty will not commit such an act of imprudence first because i	58.49529721631759
before he could be possibly set free the cardinal would be dead and indeed so co	104.51290836881141
well then i will content myself with arresting you	54.17287638271771
madame the possibility of my arrest has been foreseen and should i not have retu	73.45138118131001
it is evident sir that your position has kept you out of relation to men and aff	60.323394755590186
your pardon madame i know all that	48.90354560927051
and therefore my friends will conduct monsieur le cardinal neither to de beaufor	114.20800301977714
these gentlemen wage war on private account and in buying them up by granting th	121.48981555886851
he will be delivered to the parliament members of which can of course be bought 	89.47876983096258
i think returned anne of austria fixing upon him a glance which in any womans fa	103.92937344166666
madame replied dartagnan i threaten simply and solely because i am obliged to do	78.18232493657366
believe me madame as true a thing as it is that a heart beats in this bosoma hea	66.31350917928398
have you then madame no compassion for your servants who for twenty years have v	107.356041234639
what am i a poor officer without fortune without protection without a future unl	180.48741781779867
look at the comte de la fere a type of nobility a flower of chivalry	22.084016607572224
he has taken part against his queen or rather against her minister	193.26391355762163
he has not been unreasonably exacting it seems to me	25.607978109334198
look at monsieur du vallon that faithful soul that arm of steel who for twenty y	168.5005976587642
consider in short your people who love you and who yet are famished who have no 	150.5469617927572
anne of austria looked with wonderment on the warlike countenance of dartagnan w	29.06235386442399
why did you not say all this before you took action sir she said	100.61735796244693
because madame it was necessary to prove to your majesty one thing of which you 	51.72613385912257
and that valor would shrink from no undertaking according to what i see	244.98053084664423
it has hesitated at nothing in the past why then should it be less daring in the	128.1055750071837
then in case of my refusal this valor should a struggle occur will even go the l	129.40388490724493
we have not thought about it yet madame answered dartagnan with that gascon effr	54.46161426388855
i ought muttered anne to herself by this time to remember that these men are gia	67.29637994030514
alas madame exclaimed dartagnan this proves to me that not till today has your m	115.24576956859548
perhaps said anne but that idea if at last i have it	56.67193581491014
your majesty will do us justice	44.088000537532324
in doing us justice you will no longer treat us as men of vulgar stamp	145.44504489589374
you will see in me an ambassador worthy of the high interests he is authorized t	86.79360333487747
where is the treaty	25.204105860844155
here it is	10.910703520470802
anne of austria cast her eyes upon the treaty that dartagnan presented to her	72.19844212683523
i do not see here she said anything but general conditions the interests of the 	80.85672308776981
we do ourselves justice madame even in assuming the high position that we have	184.20560130780814
we do not think ourselves worthy to stand near such great names	190.78584368471095
but you i presume have decided to assert your pretensions viva voce	136.91883352296833
i believe you madame to be a great and powerful queen and that it will be unwort	30.461304591402296
it is my intention so to do come let us hear you	43.21597928058792
he who has negotiated these matters forgive me if i begin by speaking of myself 	174.24026842614379
tis the appointment monsieur de trville held you ask of me	146.19543808310266
the place madame is vacant and although tis a year since monsieur de trville has	134.9906783268322
but it is one of the principal military appointments in the kings household	79.5306895041638
monsieur de trville was but a younger son of a simple gascon family like me mada	51.01056782749382
you have an answer ready for everything replied the queen and she took from her 	49.963431150679185
undoubtedly madame said dartagnan taking the document and bowing this is a noble	71.82268975642188
what more do you want asked the queen coloring as she found that she had to deal	48.3626198240681
a hundred thousand francs for this poor captain of musketeers to be paid wheneve	43.02712826853915
anne hesitated	313.71654545218354
to think of the parisians soliloquized dartagnan offering only the other day by 	93.93069654294418
come said anne tis reasonable since you only ask from a queen the sixth of what 	155.0363626336904
now then she said what next	79.84280140181181
madame my friend du vallon is rich and has therefore nothing in the way of fortu	31.113190013848286
nay it must have been a promise	32.77712406289826
a country clown said anne of austria people will laugh	151.65509482248598
let them answered dartagnan	65.43276460666519
but i am sure of one thingthat those who laugh at him in his presence will never	67.31701659737521
here goes the barony	465.067625871955
said the queen she signed a patent	86.74229934902932
now there remains the chevalier or the abb dherblay as your majesty pleases	84.5599222854964
does he wish to be a bishop	31.026224899398656
no madame something easier to grant	634.9789340245322
it is that the king should deign to stand godfather to the son of madame de long	60.9572178704318
the queen smiled	50.82598141750516
monsieur de longueville is of royal blood madame said dartagnan	44.458912107707086
yes said the queen but his son	20.813421429032513
his son madame must be since the husband of the sons mother is	177.52373675210322
and your friend has nothing more to ask for madame de longueville	25.034793081567027
no madame for i presume that the king standing godfather to him could do no less	109.2634376570937
as to the government of normandy replied the queen i think i can promise but wit	38.868694258126695
we shall search for some madame and i think we can find a little and if your maj	42.66250602899334
what next	327.22764467747356
what next madame	447.2031826417649
that is all	11.15706197650133
have nt you then a fourth companion	139.5524230128434
yes madame the comte de la fere	7.778525579524454
what does he ask	35.53790219475862
there is in the world then one man who having the power to ask asksnothing	64.60439928456526
there is the comte de la fere madame	9.245547410306447
the comte de la fere is not a man	7.122547233844579
what is he then	9.754217045016093
the comte de la fere is a demigod	11.943035622957526
has he not a son a young man a relative a nephew of whom comminges spoke to me a	39.03119657225688
he has as your majesty has said a ward who is called the vicomte de bragelonne	34.32486694185977
if that young man should be appointed to a regiment what would his guardian say	162.5704072254148
perhaps he would accept	194.7399534050232
yes if your majesty herself should beg him to accept	192.71939848615898
he must be indeed a strange man	87.86386194873566
well we will reflect and perhaps we will beg him	103.79313044967999
are you satisfied sir	10.800033812451689
there is one thing the queen has not signedher assent to the treaty	52.19524196493851
of what use today i will sign it tomorrow	177.74413252629495
i can assure her majesty that if she does not sign today she will not have time 	55.54761185719856
consent then i beg you madame to write at the bottom of this schedule which has 	40.03902573615831
i consent to ratify the treaty proposed by the parisians	142.09519103082832
anne was caught she could not draw backshe signed but scarcely had she done so w	147.22983332259682
dartagnan started on seeing these tears	175.11559197310254
since that period of history queens have shed tears like other women	686.244041918079
the gascon shook his head these tears from royalty melted his heart	110.93551527715967
madame he said kneeling look upon the unhappy man at your feet	68.52039010423243
he begs you to believe that at a gesture of your majesty everything will be poss	121.08809345772889
he has faith in himself he has faith in his friends he wishes also to have faith	99.34162075596788
and in proof that he fears nothing that he counts on nothing he will restore mon	278.50367297798044
behold madame here are the august signatures of your majestys hand if you think 	103.97973594543504
and dartagnan full of splendid pride and manly intrepidity placed in annes hands	207.98714054963585
there are momentsfor if everything is not good everything in this world is not b	115.7700053826143
dartagnan when he gave way to his own feelingswhich were in accordance with thos	61.02381689183071
he was therefore instantly recompensed either for his address or for his sensibi	101.77365063252427
you were right sir said anne	12.02027629829662
i misunderstood you	286.10918417710786
there are the acts signed i deliver them to you without compulsion	186.162901447352
go and bring me back the cardinal as soon as possible	32.52996811557153
madame faltered dartagnan tis twenty years agoi have a good memorysince i had th	112.88901226924014

madame said dartagnan rising i have only one thing more to wish which is that th	45.52846245794756
and with this conclusiona way peculiar to himselfhe rose and left the room	121.01772970008999
i never rightly understood those men said the queen as she watched him retiring 	71.380956658179
in twentyfour hours dartagnan and porthos conducted mazarin to the queen and the	32.929276189158394
on the same day the treaty of paris was signed and it was everywhere announced t	38.36929638480316
here is what each of the parties concerned gained by that treaty	190.09977330825237
monsieur de conti received damvilliers and having made his proofs as general he 	70.99077060882856
moreover something had been said of a marriage with mazarins niece	73.1115230661742
the idea was welcomed by the prince to whom it was of little importance whom he 	84.91071755299774
the duc de beaufort made his entrance at court receiving ample reparation for th	86.02159994070837
full pardon was accorded to those who had aided in his escape	95.03298237889487
he received also the office of admiral which had been held by his father the duc	69.42405500255266
the duc de bouillon received domains of a value equal to that of his principalit	50.66116763479943

the duc delbeuf obtained payment of certain sums due to his wife one hundred tho	78.25109992686116
the coadjutor alone obtained nothing	660.0979601283865
they promised indeed to negotiate with the pope for a cardinals hat for him but 	155.99065544021752
quite contrary to the lot of monsieur de conti unable to be cardinal he was obli	38.70321421704512
and therefore when all paris was rejoicing in the expected return of the king ap	75.6169342327852
those two men were the count de rochefort and the mendicant of saint eustache	15.435182987493647

chapter lxxxix	2.79662089518192
difficult for kings to return to the capitals of their kingdoms	45.33497491763802
whilst dartagnan and porthos were engaged in conducting the cardinal to saint ge	59.25804493507457
each had his own particular visit to make	99.98636978136146
aramis rushed to the hotel de ville where madame de longueville was sojourning	19.985986576845818
the duchess loudly lamented the announcement of peace	582.4160854879722
war had made her a queen peace brought her abdication	240.02473431838584

madame de longueville was persuaded	17.014581003514614
this frondist duchess trusted so confidently to the power of her fine eyes that 	206.9901412803709
athos on quitting aramis went to madame de chevreuse	39.74216140751314
here was another frondeuse to persuade and she was even less open to conviction 	145.51732930534052
there had been no stipulation in her favor	62.12257084895027
monsieur de chevreuse had not been appointed governor of a province and if the q	30.557080722509745
at the first announcement of peace madame de chevreuse frowned and in spite of a	24.40033269935189

you will get yourself exiled as you did in the time of louis xiii	49.17347100877319

the duchess smiled half tenderly half ironically	464.0942258316147
count she said you are i fear gained over to the court	70.41601740859532
i suppose you have a blue ribbon in your pocket	40.560397829870055
yes madame i have that of the garter which king charles i	41.283023202258576
gave me some days before he died	47.67420010333171
come i am growing an old woman said the duchess pensively	54.35420732460284
athos took her hand and kissed it	23.25388501869654
she sighed as she looked at him	26.63430637153924
count she said bragelonne must be a charming place	54.10673612851776
you are a man of taste	13.475390900072634
you have waterwoodsflowers there	222.9668159601118
she sighed again and leaned her charming head gracefully reclined on her hand st	107.97776181303388
madame exclaimed athos what were you saying just now about growing old never hav	165.54923869035358
the duchess shook her head	44.655452724524714
does monsieur de bragelonne remain in paris she inquired	51.41577245692351
what think you of it inquired athos	22.987977922065742
leave him with me replied the duchess	25.834003255314176
no madame if you have forgotten the history of oedipus i at least remember it	37.25399650340957
really sir you are delightful and i should like to spend a month at bragelonne	56.867976738409574
are you not afraid of making people envious of me duchess replied athos	58.182899018026355
no i shall go incognito count under the name of marie michon	52.987905339610194
you are adorable madame	98.13922732507667
but do not keep raoul with you	45.51498275331407
why not	63.113617946823354
because he is in love	21.959587548789624
he he is quite a child	94.55430341565575
and tis a child he loves	242.54542271223377
athos became thoughtful	312.15020463392
you are right duchess	90.80039668065565
this singular passion for a child of seven may some day make him very unhappy	334.5089230995139
there is to be war in flanders	30.23648393429706
he shall go thither	131.91638738701252
and at his return you will send him to me	28.10180440328395
i will arm him against love	866.0930142676455
alas madame exclaimed athos today love is like warthe breastplate is becoming us	396.25466364525346
raoul entered at this moment he came to announce that the solemn entrance of the	35.20047141356046
the next day in fact at daybreak the court made preparations to quit saint germa	83.48634570754247
meanwhile the queen every hour had been sending for dartagnan	105.19182210189021
i hear she said that paris is not quiet	41.782522988893454
i am afraid for the kings safety place yourself close to the coach door on the r	76.78033722793722
reassure yourself madame i will answer for the kings safety	44.31776669150577
as he left the queens presence bernouin summoned him to the cardinal	41.93444593235495
sir said mazarin to him an emeute is spoken of in paris	59.892496573147106
i shall be on the kings left and as i am the chief person threatened remain at t	91.32001305310042
your eminence may be perfectly easy replied dartagnan they will not touch a hair	71.83645866241618
deuce take it he thought to himself how can i take care of both ah plague ont i 	144.5798071337079
this arrangement pleased every one	936.8092683019785
the queen had confidence in the courage of dartagnan which she knew and the card	79.69654861970633
the royal procession set out for paris	153.15233895375368
guitant and comminges at the head of the guards marched first then came the roya	41.96850277762263
during twenty he had been lieutenant their captain since the night before	207.68061528686172
the cortege proceeded to notre dame where a te deum was chanted	85.31514640285434
all paris were in the streets	44.67440785384331
the swiss were drawn up along the road but as the road was long they were placed	65.45738664839656
this force was therefore wholly insufficient and from time to time the line was 	139.82425258297397
whenever this occurred although it proceeded only from goodwill and a desire to 	215.69587277157768
mazarin who had dispensed a thousand louis to make the people cry long live maza	140.97238957438094
at the palais royal the crowd which had flowed in from the adjacent street was s	84.72087667096784
when the procession reached the palace loud cries of long live their majesties r	161.32896625442353
mazarin leaned out of the window	35.37620163286722
one or two shouts of long live the cardinal saluted his shadow but instantly his	128.22340200133206
mazarin turned pale and shrank back in the coach	54.89535799119413
lowborn fellows ejaculated porthos	274.2495524934451
dartagnan said nothing but twirled his mustache with a peculiar gesture which sh	78.46714156292121
anne of austria bent down and whispered in the young kings ear	114.83681878917483
say something gracious to monsieur dartagnan my son	148.8503042690632
the young king leaned toward the door	44.909382191900114
i have not said goodmorning to you monsieur dartagnan he said nevertheless i hav	45.55256656195429
it was you who were behind my bedcurtains that night the parisians wished to see	77.91667095513064
and if the king permits me returned the gascon i shall be near him always when t	57.26930427288558
sir said mazarin to porthos what would you do if the crowd fell upon us	40.151272472041185
kill as many as i could my lord	53.83901510143156
hem brave as you are and strong as you are you could not kill them all	82.21560698142055
tis true answered porthos rising on his saddle in order that he might appraise t	25.137241017824334
i think i should like the other fellow better than this one said mazarin to hims	55.309342550763
the queen and her minister more especially the latter had reason to feel anxious	234.83895346769958
the crowd whilst preserving an appearance of respect and even of affection for t	185.1582669865029
reports were whispered about like certain sounds which announce as they whistle 	736.7050683849811
dartagnan turned toward the musketeers and made a sign imperceptible to the crow	41.936525557730974
the ranks closed firmly in and a kind of majestic tremor ran from man to man	369.65865038142323
at the barriere des sergents the procession was obliged to stop	34.528250678390776
comminges left the head of the escort and went to the queens carriage	30.038958197875463
anne questioned dartagnan by a look	55.35855109836784
he answered in the same language	33.827242210502725
proceed she said	54.96212155456188
comminges returned to his post	26.51492587957398
an effort was made and the living barrier was violently broken through	174.74365379476188
some complaints arose from the crowd and were addressed this time to the king as	103.30756133710969
onward cried dartagnan in a loud voice	12.774083041519457
onward cried porthos	23.67889534986543
but as if the multitude had waited only for this demonstration to burst out all 	126.16345102867142
cries of down with mazarin death to the cardinal resounded on all sides	183.59667627946087
at the same time through the streets of grenelle saint honore and du coq a doubl	15.634567068209797
this new eruption was more dangerous than the others being composed of armed men	80.30166440340015
it was plain that it was not the chance combination of those who had collected a	34.7201968006877
each of these mobs was led by a chief one of whom appeared to belong not to the 	97.52647712234612
both were evidently stimulated by the same impulse	108.62913437597386
there was a shock which was perceived even in the royal carriage	92.8153459426746
myriads of hoarse cries forming one vast uproar were heard mingled with guns fir	130.6297394866705
ho musketeers cried dartagnan	63.86994506525813
the escort divided into two files	443.85739580828425
one of them passed around to the right of the carriage the other to the left	27.862513697511755
one went to support dartagnan the other porthos	104.11220259564809
then came a skirmish the more terrible because it had no definite object the mor	157.69762533358696
like all popular movements the shock given by the rush of this mob was formidabl	149.49011673206437
the musketeers few in number not being able in the midst of this crowd to make t	107.61019951481062
dartagnan offered to lower the blinds of the royal carriage but the young king s	74.75411164209031
no sir i wish to see everything	23.812419255575204
if your majesty wishes to look outwell then look replied dartagnan	99.09489426866789
and turning with that fury which made him so formidable he rushed toward the chi	107.24194519757258
make room cried dartagnan	163.90274027580597
zounds give way	996.9144843219993
at these words the man with a pistol and sword raised his head but it was too la	39.956785198699166
the blow was sped by dartagnan the rapier had pierced his bosom	89.23321859262576
ah confound it cried the gascon trying in vain too late to retract the thrust	74.77282789223467
what the devil are you doing here count	33.668717345588625
accomplishing my destiny replied rochefort falling on one knee	58.58705251225507
i have already got up again after three stabs from you i shall never rise after 	109.05538881626983
count said dartagnan with some degree of emotion i struck without knowing that i	49.325024052199915
i am sorry if you die that you should die with sentiments of hatred toward me	110.9706981419895
rochefort extended his hand to dartagnan who took it	15.376671223971849
the count wished to speak but a gush of blood stifled him	53.16243061416134
he stiffened in the last convulsions of death and expired	145.88499466296432
back people cried dartagnan your leader is dead you have no longer any business 	65.22010325898809
indeed as if de rochefort had been the very soul of the attack the crowd who had	67.9771111114314

the left of the carriage was as well cleared as the right and they drew up the b	58.20221188529711
porthos looked very melancholy	101.59110113569308
what a devil of a face you have porthos and what a strange air for a victor	114.43515768887339
but you answered porthos seem to me agitated	195.62775532722924
there s a reason zounds i have just killed an old friend	40.68816024840612
indeed replied porthos who	13.853149685939181
that poor count de rochefort	53.89439334968514
well exactly like me i have just killed a man whose face is not unknown to me	87.8783594216075
unluckily i hit him on the head and immediately his face was covered with blood	58.2741087138846
and he said nothing as he died	52.838764735428036
yes he exclaimed oh	68.1952176010901
i suppose answered dartagnan laughing if he only said that it did not enlighten 	93.39337504114951
well sir cried the queen	17.303961420536304
madame the passage is quite clear and your majesty can continue your road	123.798589611818
in fact the procession arrived in safety at notre dame at the front gate of whic	59.63945753850065
as the service was drawing to a close a boy entered the church in great exciteme	93.07235212874399
bazin felt some one pulling his sleeve	277.88908552753435
he lowered to earth his eyes beatifically raised to heaven and recognized frique	99.36455037346813

well go on	169.76192763761762
well he received in the scrimmage a sword stroke on the head	104.7614846607889
that great giant who was there gave it to him	153.56082119529577
in that case said bazin he must be pretty sick	34.16025526138415
so sick that he is dying and he wants to confess to the coadjutor who they say h	58.65643191212085
and does he imagine that the coadjutor will put himself out for him	80.53093186750095
to be sure the coadjutor has promised	62.74127278953876
who told you that	13.621517415394043
monsieur maillard himself	73.71664308378116

in fact he slowly and respectfully approached the prelate and spoke to him priva	87.15316629089291
he then returned with the same slow step and said	65.3549338016754
go and tell the dying man that he must be patient	34.817897807071496
monseigneur will be with him in an hour	44.60772784255425

to the tower saint jacques la boucherie and delighted with the success of his em	63.11539357197574
when the te deum was over the coadjutor without stopping to change his priestly 	71.0508138756711
he arrived in time	199.2639897989381
though sinking from moment to moment the wounded man was not yet dead	231.18014390961554
the door was opened to the coadjutor of the room in which the mendicant was suff	24.086082587665384
a moment later friquet went out carrying in his hand a large leather bag he open	58.49010939835874
the mendicant had kept his word and made friquet his heir	84.13925153729241

mother nanette began by picking up the louis then she picked up friquet	120.28862990445312
in the meantime the cortege returned to the palais royal	20.035088489571876
that monsieur dartagnan is a very brave man mother said the young king	32.058380215153065
yes my son and he rendered very important services to your father	151.13906866290642

that was a great honor for dartagnan and for porthos	26.795085617749244
porthos was delighted and yet during the entire repast he seemed to be preoccupi	51.03121069169547
what was the matter with you baron dartagnan said to him as they descended the s	37.45133455766553
you seemed at dinner to be anxious about something	223.3695962215148

the four friends embraced with tears in their eyes	40.89278789700606

dartagnan returned to the rue tiquetonne with porthos still possessed by the wis	34.733634497000324

on the 24th of february 1815 the lookout at notredame de la garde signalled the 	45.12459762749701
as usual a pilot put off immediately and rounding the chteau dif got on board th	159.94828739878136
immediately and according to custom the ramparts of fort saintjean were covered 	57.35347511435423
the ship drew on and had safely passed the strait which some volcanic shock has 	350.4593853552179
however those experienced in navigation saw plainly that if any accident had occ	313.7883576890154
the vague disquietude which prevailed among the spectators had so much affected 	150.08672633927412
when the young man on board saw this person approach he left his station by the 	81.3044693639861
he was a fine tall slim young fellow of eighteen or twenty with black eyes and h	55.19786854898057
ah is it you dants cried the man in the skiff	42.172771911749706
what s the matter and why have you such an air of sadness aboard	50.006309671814286
a great misfortune m	271.34670823929315
morrel replied the young man a great misfortune for me especially off civita vec	47.17737805866754
and the cargo inquired the owner eagerly	240.32513160338485
is all safe m	166.46128886025625
morrel and i think you will be satisfied on that head	33.908134377601826
but poor captain leclere	281.57423305559183
what happened to him asked the owner with an air of considerable resignation	29.402435998378404
what happened to the worthy captain	170.05408009532536
he died	897.203790680585
fell into the sea	19.701913276212196
no sir he died of brainfever in dreadful agony	171.5527475518476
then turning to the crew he said bear a hand there to take in sail	81.0372869822988
all hands obeyed and at once the eight or ten seamen who composed the crew spran	75.35902691148502
the young sailor gave a look to see that his orders were promptly and accurately	53.56468749813522
and how did this misfortune occur inquired the latter resuming the interrupted c	169.11710306604158
0023 m	1.0112850665122344
alas sir in the most unexpected manner	64.01568868915874
after a long talk with the harbormaster captain leclere left naples greatly dist	172.59973224697194
in twentyfour hours he was attacked by a fever and died three days afterwards	88.37615486626778
we performed the usual burial service and he is at his rest sewn up in his hammo	74.13750573828607
we bring to his widow his sword and cross of honor	250.26433045765373
it was worth while truly added the young man with a melancholy smile to make war	76.89285417627228
why you see edmond replied the owner who appeared more comforted at every moment	69.12563696188163
if not why there would be no promotion and since you assure me that the cargo	87.69451109648011
is all safe and sound m	315.23798027692015
morrel take my word for it and i advise you not to take 25000 francs for the pro	31.909552199318586
then as they were just passing the round tower the young man shouted stand by th	133.945026563249
the order was executed as promptly as it would have been on board a manofwar	43.378740174150316
let goand clue up at this last command all the sails were lowered and the vessel	205.46112113772787
now if you will come on board m	35.62320785928868
morrel said dants observing the owners impatience here is your supercargo m	106.62252934879056
danglars coming out of his cabin who will furnish you with every particular	132.59717198646038
as for me i must look after the anchoring and dress the ship in mourning	89.16916172569067
the owner did not wait for a second invitation	59.96562357858378
he seized a rope which dants flung to him and with an activity that would have d	62.71692477577151
he was a man of twentyfive or twentysix years of age of unprepossessing countena	16.360316780142572
well m	221.0501980635253
morrel said danglars you have heard of the misfortune that has befallen us	35.4298171725958
yesyes poor captain leclere he was a brave and an honest man	93.64412253556095
and a firstrate seaman one who had seen long and honorable service as became a m	251.60254194597843
but replied the owner glancing after dants who was watching the anchoring of his	59.75850520761062
yes said danglars darting at edmond a look gleaming with hate	55.23196398617083
yes he is young and youth is invariably selfconfident	89.22772984828543
scarcely was the captains breath out of his body when he assumed the command wit	99.04307223948182
0025 m	1.0141013862401325
as to taking command of the vessel replied morrel that was his duty as captains 	93.81816283628974
the vessel was in as good condition as i am and as i hope you are m	57.42068180637754
morrel and this day and a half was lost from pure whim for the pleasure of going	106.62944402840586
dants said the shipowner turning towards the young man come this way	57.238700036813334
in a moment sir answered dants and i m with you	35.99862830030723
then calling to the crew he said let go	88.81474782345796
the anchor was instantly dropped and the chain ran rattling through the porthole	177.96123782792094
dants continued at his post in spite of the presence of the pilot until this man	33.56004362942511
you see said danglars he fancies himself captain already upon my word	135.10994157421425
and so in fact he is said the owner	55.753267153206785
except your signature and your partners m	214.02251885774663
and why should he not have this asked the owner he is young it is true but he se	34.585198392703774
a cloud passed over danglars brow	65.31328126584873
your pardon m	222.59819455504802
morrel said dants approaching the vessel now rides at anchor and i am at your se	61.516217687514455
you hailed me i think	83.60263023103487
danglars retreated a step or two	172.9183700091985
i wished to inquire why you stopped at the island of elba	48.03313194877702
i do not know sir it was to fulfil the last instructions of captain leclere who 	38.62289789131929
then did you see him edmond	24.67989938857094
the marshal	443.88364089889274
morrel looked around him and then drawing dants on one side he said suddenly	53.19562388980984
and how is the emperor	58.2971767045773
very well as far as i could judge from the sight of him	35.79060239952281
you saw the emperor then	133.50326552673044
he entered the marshals apartment while i was there	104.36913186741185
and you spoke to him	23.052329749676552
why it was he who spoke to me sir said dants with a smile	11.885329708534162
and what did he say to you	10.918466001437745
asked me questions about the vessel the time she left marseilles the course she 	182.2818304810289
i believe if she had not been laden and i had been her master he would have boug	36.67810577382785
but i told him i was only mate and that she belonged to the firm of morrel   son	43.88429917305776
ah yes he said i know them	26.53565635114934
the morrels have been shipowners from father to son and there was a morrel who s	53.43127118546615
pardieu and that is true cried the owner greatly delighted	126.3080367447605
and that was policar morrel my uncle who was afterwards a captain	83.84763907383011
dants you must tell my uncle that the emperor remembered him and you will see it	51.68947008925076
come come continued he patting edmonds shoulder kindly you did very right dants 	152.53474213658598
0027 m	1.0085532665860193
how could that bring me into trouble sir asked dants for i did not even know of 	47.016716385555846
but pardon me here are the health officers and the customs inspectors coming alo	440.05207917305023
and the young man went to the gangway	20.58568591708985
as he departed danglars approached and said	112.23125331710045
well it appears that he has given you satisfactory reasons for his landing at po	98.86245058425031
yes most satisfactory my dear danglars	96.99078319230382
well so much the better said the supercargo for it is not pleasant to think that	30.06146914771233
dants has done his replied the owner and that is not saying much	130.77919421258207
it was captain leclere who gave orders for this delay	64.47120935938636
talking of captain leclere has not dants given you a letter from him	63.94713561367806
to menowas there one	578.0429811111366
i believe that besides the packet captain leclere confided a letter to his care	121.43311448422222
of what packet are you speaking danglars	126.14347968162055
why that which dants left at portoferrajo	114.59471340421211
how do you know he had a packet to leave at portoferrajo	30.743445672225228
danglars turned very red	228.69827639165294
i was passing close to the door of the captains cabin which was half open and i 	45.04296043377546
he did not speak to me of it replied the shipowner but if there be any letter he	46.39013904060381
danglars reflected for a moment	33.3055944293944
then m	362.18553239207955
morrel i beg of you said he not to say a word to dants on the subject	29.204815792354676
i may have been mistaken	68.28297510149754
at this moment the young man returned danglars withdrew	18.491319696847633
well my dear dants are you now free inquired the owner	44.31195567408414
yes sir	24.370303842846955
you have not been long detained	74.53158759510103
i gave the customhouse officers a copy of our bill of lading and as to the other	90.40431614823612
then you have nothing more to do here	32.70017745373325
noeverything is all right now	100.03386756708572
then you can come and dine with me	40.85838628617472

my first visit is due to my father though i am not the less grateful for the hon	41.82785350797954
0029 m	1.0239207750937998
right dants quite right	306.8449828087658
i always knew you were a good son	69.95547730280377
and inquired dants with some hesitation do you know how my father is	28.48675899225482
well i believe my dear edmond though i have not seen him lately	25.11559696288729
yes he likes to keep himself shut up in his little room	72.7702532445276
that proves at least that he has wanted for nothing during your absence	102.01770626042034
dants smiled	95.55344334063604
my father is proud sir and if he had not a meal left i doubt if he would have as	75.12438471234337
well then after this first visit has been made we shall count on you	113.35138456786675
i must again excuse myself m	468.0226325829285
morrel for after this first visit has been paid i have another which i am most a	115.39814626751796
true dants i forgot that there was at the catalans someone who expects you no le	83.18438155075293
dants blushed	1015.6446455012062
ah ha said the shipowner i am not in the least surprised for she has been to me 	36.281626451660024
peste edmond you have a very handsome mistress	54.56968880833352
she is not my mistress replied the young sailor gravely she is my betrothed	52.320831516104114
sometimes one and the same thing said morrel with a smile	18.3175097267475
not with us sir replied dants	28.043287381183408
well well my dear edmond continued the owner do nt let me detain you	29.02316214504417
you have managed my affairs so well that i ought to allow you all the time you r	43.718244640431635
do you want any money	19.784745339941555
no sir i have all my pay to takenearly three months wages	85.25199152588351
you are a careful fellow edmond	30.164868766148704

yes yes i know how good a son you are so now hasten away to see your father	91.3798196053389

then i have your leave sir	74.59939211253848
yes if you have nothing more to say to me	22.305826180005077
captain leclere did not before he died give you a letter for me	77.76897708084317
he was unable to write sir	79.19887312227767
but that reminds me that i must ask your leave of absence for some days	64.58425544675342
to get married	1198.0790368754738
yes first and then to go to paris	59.820457098041494

it will take quite six weeks to unload the cargo and we can not get you ready fo	59.596673236477045
without her captain cried dants his eyes sparkling with animation pray mind what	123.05226646309252
is it really your intention to make me captain of the pharaon	48.351551765539114
if i were sole owner we d shake hands on it now my dear dants and call it settle	273.26569010727275
but the thing is at least half done as you have one out of two votes	74.6696794342291
rely on me to procure you the other i will do my best	34.812925723118624
ah m	235.11223142054874

that is according to the sense you attach to the question sir	96.96465613461872
do you mean is he a good comrade no for i think he never liked me since the day 	93.77598628455667
if you mean as responsible agent when you ask me the question i believe there is	89.54842915322376
but tell me dants if you had command of the pharaon should you be glad to see da	30.347488598695264
captain or mate m	258.6549115150934

i hope soon to see you again my dear edmond	34.248891970260786
good luck to you	79.28396550430121
the young sailor jumped into the skiff and sat down in the stern sheets with the	42.54751950160952
the two oarsmen bent to their work and the little boat glided away as rapidly as	102.41962946351586
the shipowner smiling followed him with his eyes until he saw him spring out on 	100.55620448281907
on turning round the owner saw danglars behind him apparently awaiting orders bu	317.15219563950507

this room was occupied by dants father	49.74778654181653
the news of the arrival of the pharaon had not yet reached the old man who mount	37.305939351930725
suddenly he felt an arm thrown around his body and a wellknown voice behind him 	79.91639042558808
the old man uttered a cry and turned round then seeing his son he fell into his 	35.99301562475586

the old man nodded	43.164760085787734
so that you have lived for three months on sixty francs muttered edmond	46.956525450500024
you know how little i require said the old man	36.645860603409986
heaven pardon me cried edmond falling on his knees before his father	35.23089038270549
what are you doing	5.839402093444746
you have wounded me to the heart	77.80046703871308

here father here he said take thistake it and send for something immediately	311.0986052168011
and he emptied his pockets on the table the contents consisting of a dozen gold 	50.136134366067125
the countenance of old dants brightened	150.1883857905045
whom does this belong to he inquired	95.36367807396533

but hush here comes somebody	1857.3933861217008
tis caderousse who has heard of your arrival and no doubt comes to congratulate 	84.06381829422224
ah lips that say one thing while the heart thinks another murmured edmond	420.0145703595967
but never mind he is a neighbor who has done us a service on a time so he s welc	52.81323527930591
as edmond paused the black and bearded head of caderousse appeared at the door	50.84728907747848
he was a man of twentyfive or six and held a piece of cloth which being a tailor	42.59331439457547
what is it you edmond back again said he with a broad marseillaise accent and a 	40.643880745237176

thanksthanks but fortunately i do not want for anything and it chances that at t	81.07095079710007
dants made a gesture	34.08255621872994
i do not allude to you my boy	23.897674585834626
nono i lent you money and you returned it that s like good neighbors and we are 	130.35632765017132

what s the use of mentioning that what is done is done	63.72444209521864
let us talk of your happy return my boy	70.54527293483181
i had gone on the quay to match a piece of mulberry cloth when i met friend dang	95.9921296057882

and so i came added caderousse as fast as i could to have the pleasure of shakin	37.70897279429942
0037 m	1.0184550293187709
worthy caderousse said the old man he is so much attached to us	24.985771964643366
yes to be sure i am	14.887897712262209
i love and esteem you because honest folks are so rare	372.5209698543941
but it seems you have come back rich my boy continued the tailor looking askance	252.7069146749497
the young man remarked the greedy glance which shone in the dark eyes of his nei	31.96907043763063
eh he said negligently this money is not mine	45.14256797067641
i was expressing to my father my fears that he had wanted many things in my abse	66.19434292824359
come father added dants put this money back in your boxunless neighbor caderouss	258.8106087337135

it was offered with good will said dants	220.9218521110191

well you stand well with m	241.68382587317186
morrel i hearyou insinuating dog you	1174.6786556631807
morrel has always been exceedingly kind to me replied dants	54.2430029733684
then you were wrong to refuse to dine with him	40.616447202031466
what did you refuse to dine with him said old dants and did he invite you to din	49.012882319151686
yes my dear father replied edmond smiling at his fathers astonishment at the exc	19.44376930000843
and why did you refuse my son inquired the old man	24.22826743115617
that i might the sooner see you again my dear father replied the young man	42.017230590203155
i was most anxious to see you	23.481268813179753
but it must have vexed m	100.1744423503663
morrel good worthy man said caderousse	219.68720990287918
and when you are looking forward to be captain it was wrong to annoy the owner	82.11342791481576
but i explained to him the cause of my refusal replied dants and i hope he fully	42.59181147554201
yes but to be captain one must do a little flattery to ones patrons	111.77536888734318
i hope to be captain without that said dants	42.44880005148932
so much the betterso much the better nothing will give greater pleasure to all y	88.89694517010282
mercds said the old man	10.537299975010317
yes my dear father and with your permission now i have seen you and know you are	38.99983015151811
go my dear boy said old dants and heaven bless you in your wife as it has blesse	49.556744768349624
his wife said caderousse why how fast you go on father dants she is not his wife	95.22336095098805
no but according to all probability she soon will be replied edmond	121.70963006141375
yesyes said caderousse but you were right to return as soon as possible my boy	28.448872533825725
and why	83.72925703462369
because mercds is a very fine girl and fine girls never lack followers she parti	94.61496488824992
really answered edmond with a smile which had in it traces of slight uneasiness	51.65687178312832
0039 m	1.0143287185478223
ah yes continued caderousse and capital offers too but you know you will be capt	68.2475917046823
meaning to say replied dants with a smile which but illconcealed his trouble tha	29.482164468632718
eheh said caderousse shaking his head	13.718644463953801
come come said the sailor i have a better opinion than you of women in general a	59.222141883498665
so much the betterso much the better said caderousse	28.49999243811269
when one is going to be married there is nothing like implicit confidence but ne	86.83222545086744
i will go directly was edmonds reply and embracing his father and nodding to cad	75.31186035690976
caderousse lingered for a moment then taking leave of old dants he went downstai	85.29627230647073
well said danglars did you see him	15.692840419716317
i have just left him answered caderousse	38.9316682755363
did he allude to his hope of being captain	81.49294972064537
he spoke of it as a thing already decided	115.36871104584755
indeed said danglars he is in too much hurry it appears to me	27.42991109323786
why it seems m	76.59468435102391
morrel has promised him the thing	105.03083352360122
so that he is quite elated about it	45.2451572396221
why yes he is actually insolent over the matterhas already offered me his patron	273.03033357285955
which you refused	155.23957343446048
most assuredly although i might easily have accepted it for it was i who put int	77.8482641367423
dants has no longer any occasion for assistancehe is about to become a captain	70.88756618463609
pooh said danglars he is not one yet	20.81900477244251
ma foi it will be as well if he is not answered caderousse for if he should be t	20.08488566168265
if we choose replied danglars he will remain what he is and perhaps become even 	117.80256756952178
what do you mean	3.9179334995320025
nothingi was speaking to myself	165.01528295268187
and is he still in love with the catalane	40.16716648054903
over head and ears but unless i am much mistaken there will be a storm in that q	106.62217345829725
0041 m	1.012393713456142
explain yourself	69.6945102083874
why should i	18.22934721367315
it is more important than you think perhaps	77.16439960972848
you do not like dants	25.025238920702375
i never like upstarts	481.371613418296
then tell me all you know about the catalane	33.18190255097746
i know nothing for certain only i have seen things which induce me to believe as	80.73925281290829
what have you seencome tell me	108.05507267813296
well every time i have seen mercds come into the city she has been accompanied b	67.78917562623063
really and you think this cousin pays her attentions	191.32234118752626
i only suppose so	349.85796436295027
what else can a strapping chap of twentyone mean with a fine wench of seventeen	200.4147186796324
and you say that dants has gone to the catalans	19.763902244783917
he went before i came down	133.0382819384249
let us go the same way we will stop at la rserve and we can drink a glass of la 	35.309683539181464

the young girl made a gesture of rage	24.199315750409873
i understand you fernand you would be revenged on him because i do not love you 	43.39007681342077

fernand made no reply nor did he attempt to check the tears which flowed down th	83.32459780023167

if he is dead i shall die too	30.045691087300224
if he has forgotten you	34.559275216973816

ah exclaimed the young girl blushing with delight and fairly leaping in excess o	63.496286650192125
fernand pale and trembling drew back like a traveller at the sight of a serpent 	48.37725430208038
edmond and mercds were clasped in each others arms	67.1646536252433
the burning marseilles sun which shot into the room through the open door covere	110.99636486168292
at first they saw nothing around them	94.82213815113597
their intense happiness isolated them from all the rest of the world and they on	91.91024577447672
suddenly edmond saw the gloomy pale and threatening countenance of fernand as it	35.13861474975353
by a movement for which he could scarcely account to himself the young catalan p	38.940979267909995
ah your pardon said dants frowning in his turn i did not perceive that there wer	25.15372768151977
then turning to mercds he inquired who is this gentleman	28.755334544581736
one who will be your best friend dants for he is my friend my cousin my brother 	51.38577246469306
do you not remember him	14.277797543457158
yes said dants and without relinquishing mercds hand clasped in one of his own h	44.82423345611775
but fernand instead of responding to this amiable gesture remained mute and trem	146.0826885100222
edmond then cast his eyes scrutinizingly at the agitated and embarrassed mercds 	50.96043693691349
this look told him all and his anger waxed hot	185.01238055368725
i did not know when i came with such haste to you that i was to meet an enemy he	37.67024355651836
an enemy cried mercds with an angry look at her cousin	38.525926287241006
an enemy in my house do you say edmond if i believed that i would place my arm u	49.392136960863795
fernands eye darted lightning	2143.4382818586623
and should any misfortune occur to you dear edmond she continued with the same c	79.4871276957226
fernand became deadly pale	414.66306427337855

you have no enemy herethere is no one but fernand my brother who will grasp your	80.01064672891545
and at these words the young girl fixed her imperious look on the catalan who as	37.302479579469846
his hatred like a powerless though furious wave was broken against the strong as	399.42289864637576
scarcely however had he touched edmonds hand when he felt he had done all he cou	59.505351282753416
oh he exclaimed running furiously and tearing his hairoh who will deliver me fro	153.60212480621686

particularly when they have still a full bottle before them added danglars	178.24531610892052
fernand looked at them both with a stupefied air but did not say a word	23.15321098454721
he seems besotted said danglars pushing caderousse with his knee	84.24829000920984
are we mistaken and is dants triumphant in spite of all we have believed	97.98183688308521
why we must inquire into that was caderousses reply and turning towards the youn	72.88565128660743

fernand gave a groan which resembled a sob and dropped his head into his hands h	41.412232462478656
well fernand i must say said caderousse beginning the conversation with that bru	56.89265834858968
bah said danglars a lad of his make was not born to be unhappy in love	93.98997194028254

no he replied only hark how he sighs come come fernand said caderousse hold up y	133.87766069537224

poor fernand has been dismissed continued caderousse	59.52700486025645
well and what then said fernand lifting up his head and looking at caderousse li	30.97261177918086
oh if you take it in that sense said caderousse it is another thing	30.447145928084893
but i thought you were a catalan and they told me the catalans were not men to a	48.30305513697892
it was even told me that fernand especially was terrible in his vengeance	94.25454520389822
fernand smiled piteously	490.1732460873049
a lover is never terrible he said	171.57344488961385

danglars saw in the muddled look of the tailor the progress of his intoxication 	62.33737756586574
certainly not if as you said just now you have the means of having dants arreste	39.94273617020664
have you that means	74.04949738663008
it is to be found for the searching	39.69345049666622

i know not why you meddle said fernand seizing his arm but this i know you have 	50.93293695206695

fernand filled caderousses glass who like the confirmed toper he was lifted his 	194.1656317908575
the catalan watched him until caderousse almost overcome by this fresh assault o	127.01310327121081
well resumed the catalan as he saw the final glimmer of caderousses reason vanis	59.488612763484376
well then i should say for instance resumed danglars that if after a voyage such	115.29089519595925

yes but they will make you then sign your declaration and confront you with him 	106.24468483747162
but dants can not remain forever in prison and one day or other he will leave it	67.17160375757183

in an hour inquired danglars turning pale	50.82743558129956
how is that my friend	23.2435086702558

arrived here only yesterday morning and married today at three oclock commend me	241.79125699161577
but asked danglars in a timid tone how did you manage about the other formalitie	22.82269970870716
the contract answered dants laughingly it did nt take long to fix that	114.58853890958675

this prospect of fresh festivity redoubled the hilarity of the guests to such a 	105.0277284480413
dants perceiving the affectionate eagerness of his father responded by a look of	65.0565084044051
around the table reigned that noisy hilarity which usually prevails at such a ti	202.45956736554672

everybody talked at once without waiting for a reply and each one seemed to be c	175.42239487082279

i can not help thinking it would have been a great pity to have served him that 	40.53923495134139

to be sureto be sure cried dants eagerly quitting the table let us go directly	59.74186640017845
his words were reechoed by the whole party with vociferous cheers	94.98387333314955
at this moment danglars who had been incessantly observing every change in ferna	57.96927671659642
at the same instant his ear caught a sort of indistinct sound on the stairs foll	30.230659672168834
the sounds drew nearer	1523.095827049917
three blows were struck upon the panel of the door	38.3065379198977
the company looked at each other in consternation	33.91022019869099
i demand admittance said a loud voice outside the room in the name of the law as	72.92104004451828
uneasiness now yielded to the most extreme dread on the part of those present	104.49417184853267
may i venture to inquire the reason of this unexpected visit said m	62.02924175515925
morrel addressing the magistrate whom he evidently knew there is doubtless some 	268.3784648664112
if it be so replied the magistrate rely upon every reparation being made meanwhi	89.2536447930278
who among the persons here assembled answers to the name of edmond dants	105.1510002980143
every eye was turned towards the young man who spite of the agitation he could n	41.447950236164154
i am he what is your pleasure with me	55.367711620131566
edmond dants replied the magistrate i arrest you in the name of the law	31.9279380116113
me repeated edmond slightly changing color and wherefore i pray	295.15678086388397
i can not inform you but you will be duly acquainted with the reasons that have 	52.0856108435291
morrel felt that further resistance or remonstrance was useless	168.48589473592668
he saw before him an officer delegated to enforce the law and perfectly well kne	106.43097800683766
old dants however sprang forward	354.18864075610327
there are situations which the heart of a father or a mother can not be made to 	46.636094510966984
he prayed and supplicated in terms so moving that even the officer was touched a	205.85593323344654
your son has probably neglected some prescribed form or attention in registering	329.64460436129286
what is the meaning of all this inquired caderousse frowningly of danglars who h	20.469025498339537
0073 m	1.0140255691302207
how can i tell you replied he i am like yourself utterly bewildered at all that 	49.000088277256594
caderousse then looked around for fernand but he had disappeared	42.65053581300648
the scene of the previous night now came back to his mind with startling clearne	100.8691737223863
the painful catastrophe he had just witnessed appeared effectually to have rent 	355.9703397632586
so so said he in a hoarse and choking voice to danglars this then i suppose is a	41.05430593371102
nonsense returned danglars i tell you again i have nothing whatever to do with i	29.913566058406445
no you did not answered caderousse you merely threw it byi saw it lying in a cor	86.07399625474548
hold your tongue you foolwhat should you know about itwhy you were drunk	146.13243254250438
where is fernand inquired caderousse	16.17780732243431
how do i know replied danglars gone as every prudent man ought to be to look aft	77.49293917571065
never mind where he is let you and i go and see what is to be done for our poor 	43.583918643519404
during this conversation dants after having exchanged a cheerful shake of the ha	94.36121284897247

oh to be sure responded danglars who had now approached the group nothing more t	99.18088317566172
dants descended the staircase preceded by the magistrate and followed by the sol	52.746981799593655
a carriage awaited him at the door he got in followed by two soldiers and the ma	54.23281308932495
adieu adieu dearest edmond cried mercds stretching out her arms to him from the 	48.40085869690602
the prisoner heard the cry which sounded like the sob of a broken heart and lean	90.78333926379896

morrel i will take the first conveyance i find and hurry to marseilles whence i 	85.67217937489703
that s right exclaimed a multitude of voices go and return as quickly as you can	60.89170776414672
this second departure was followed by a long and fearful state of terrified sile	124.04109319134439
the old father and mercds remained for some time apart each absorbed in grief bu	186.7825643423978
meanwhile fernand made his appearance poured out for himself a glass of water wi	77.22218915789777
instinctively fernand drew back his chair	27.018218876929996
he is the cause of all this miseryi am quite sure of it whispered caderousse who	41.66514970826701
i do nt think so answered the other he s too stupid to imagine such a scheme	83.41535595148189
i only hope the mischief will fall upon the head of whoever wrought it	96.84386960586592
you do nt mention those who aided and abetted the deed said caderousse	143.0444283291307
surely answered danglars one can not be held responsible for every chance arrow 	120.52454533177834
you can indeed when the arrow lights point downward on somebodys head	673.2472301211993
meantime the subject of the arrest was being canvassed in every different form	148.40452554680263
what think you danglars said one of the party turning towards him of this event	64.7155496210705
why replied he i think it just possible dants may have been detected with some t	55.68766684520309
but how could he have done so without your knowledge danglars since you are the 	53.21220292515417
why as for that i could only know what i was told respecting the merchandise wit	98.49355284463158
i know she was loaded with cotton and that she took in her freight at alexandria	50.498718316361256
now i recollect said the afflicted old father my poor boy told me yesterday he h	83.96983204463572
there you see exclaimed danglars	44.122491408823386
now the mischief is out depend upon it the customhouse people went rummaging abo	359.713123704336
mercds however paid no heed to this explanation of her lovers arrest	207.9621496998985
her grief which she had hitherto tried to restrain now burst out in a violent fi	116.91469527181725
come come said the old man be comforted my poor child there is still hope	60.91540528416277
hope repeated danglars	236.66061745035853
hope faintly murmured fernand but the word seemed to die away on his pale agitat	74.50312594709077
good news good news shouted forth one of the party stationed in the balcony on t	261.0644627874743
here comes m	737.7072725496314
morrel back	18980.2877878988
no doubt now we shall hear that our friend is released	59.73881835376458
mercds and the old man rushed to meet the shipowner and greeted him at the door	27.39628444854403
he was very pale	22.756200027466985
what news exclaimed a general burst of voices	223.3154952251766
alas my friends replied m	104.34350496782852
morrel with a mournful shake of his head the thing has assumed a more serious as	109.44197673593322
oh indeedindeed sir he is innocent sobbed forth mercds	267.54435714384385
that i believe answered m	108.9762710003758
morrel but still he is charged	138.21923915364778
with what inquired the elder dants	107.5084948364862
with being an agent of the bonapartist faction many of our readers may be able t	70.49432884794439
a despairing cry escaped the pale lips of mercds the old man sank into a chair	39.57586872199788
ah danglars whispered caderousse you have deceived methe trick you spoke of last	156.65518368099808
i am determined to tell them all about it	38.520213456359805
be silent you simpleton cried danglars grasping him by the arm or i will not ans	74.36970385432016
who can tell whether dants be innocent or guilty the vessel did touch at elba wh	144.66987215258575
now should any letters or other documents of a compromising character be found u	232.09071215148745
with the rapid instinct of selfishness caderousse readily perceived the solidity	134.5790265682219
suppose we wait a while and see what comes of it said he casting a bewildered lo	151.8729186053061
to be sure answered danglars	13.17442681384641
let us wait by all means	57.680202149919
if he be innocent of course he will be set at liberty if guilty why it is no use	72.59869296904907
let us go then	4.81934733712052
i can not stay here any longer	69.1549461002992
with all my heart replied danglars pleased to find the other so tractable	40.61915873291399
let us take ourselves out of the way and leave things for the present to take th	34.74977819675401
after their departure fernand who had now again become the friend and protector 	192.80221436403409
the rumor of edmonds arrest as a bonapartist agent was not slow in circulating t	64.09436955457583
could you ever have credited such a thing my dear danglars asked m	52.25728883848104
morrel as on his return to the port for the purpose of gleaning fresh tidings of	50.994930063843334
de villefort the assistant procureur he overtook his supercargo and caderousse	84.18724960560375
could you have believed such a thing possible	76.61250974240714
why you know i told you replied danglars that i considered the circumstance of h	26.863836688410352
and did you mention these suspicions to any person beside myself	278.5404612567887
0079 m	1.0176258095740276
certainly not returned danglars	96.19763945574422
then added in a low whisper you understand that on account of your uncle m	63.585091719966
policar morrel who served under the other government and who does not altogether	87.53166371279943
i should have feared to injure both edmond and yourself had i divulged my own ap	128.01562766049173
i am too well aware that though a subordinate like myself is bound to acquaint t	82.40981469946031
tis well danglarstis well replied m	119.66767350657811
you are a worthy fellow and i had already thought of your interests in the event	45.673441979131574
is it possible you were so kind	24.041349363885708
yes indeed i had previously inquired of dants what was his opinion of you and if	111.61255361258951
and what was his reply	57.395278495262914
that he certainly did think he had given you offence in an affair which he merel	72.73400123637883
the hypocrite murmured danglars	460.33991413477884
poor dants said caderousse	4.809851994025532
no one can deny his being a noblehearted young fellow	122.8823997546388
but meanwhile continued m	1220.0510343566102
morrel here is the pharaon without a captain	54.94207610476209
oh replied danglars since we can not leave this port for the next three months l	35.234678850553024
no doubt but in the meantime	30.783903494200846
i am entirely at your service m	28.92232451377532
morrel answered danglars	52.20007058265906
you know that i am as capable of managing a ship as the most experienced captain	61.87730925992419
thanks danglarsthat will smooth over all difficulties	374.1869628868338
i fully authorize you at once to assume the command of the pharaon and look care	70.08315225699447
private misfortunes must never be allowed to interfere with business	150.46435833321587
be easy on that score m	42.399015760519774
morrel but do you think we shall be permitted to see our poor edmond	26.84171708551595
i will let you know that directly i have seen m	62.39530833451374
de villefort whom i shall endeavor to interest in edmonds favor	59.15195232694781
i am aware he is a furious royalist but in spite of that and of his being kings 	68.1167642777444
perhaps not replied danglars but i hear that he is ambitious and that s rather a	38.26824417865657
well well returned m	140.97924627023573
morrel we shall see	43.83031280434736
but now hasten on board i will join you there ere long	162.17306295630908
so saying the worthy shipowner quitted the two allies and proceeded in the direc	65.84230303962467
0081 m	1.0058443546155909
you see said danglars addressing caderousse the turn things have taken	176.3366148059266
do you still feel any desire to stand up in his defence	56.51619881712529
not the slightest but yet it seems to me a shocking thing that a mere joke shoul	39.7094283630424
but who perpetrated that joke let me ask neither you nor myself but fernand you 	254.23366477185232
oh no replied caderousse that i can answer for you did not	18.84662129739882
i only wish i could see it now as plainly as i saw it lying all crushed and crum	71.31648550051104
well then if you did depend upon it fernand picked it up and either copied it or	112.03325830510983
and now i think of it by heavens he may have sent the letter itself fortunately 	90.22598147830313
then you were aware of dants being engaged in a conspiracy	55.134735733291116
not i	19.1190599289234
as i before said i thought the whole thing was a joke nothing more	89.09699339576994
it seems however that i have unconsciously stumbled upon the truth	70.56357471092836
still argued caderousse i would give a great deal if nothing of the kind had hap	59.273927181075486
you will see danglars that it will turn out an unlucky job for both of us	76.27922752450519
nonsense if any harm come of it it should fall on the guilty person and that you	87.96648508732297
how can we be implicated in any way all we have got to do is to keep our own cou	37.18877064013318
amen responded caderousse waving his hand in token of adieu to danglars and bend	49.35548009653159
so far then said danglars mentally all has gone as i would have it	77.6509939559376
i am temporarily commander of the pharaon with the certainty of being permanentl	44.211461272933796
my only fear is the chance of dants being released	111.95101920849912
but there he is in the hands of justice and added he with a smile she will take 	43.511417152285055
so saying he leaped into a boat desiring to be rowed on board the pharaon where 	59.510458887213524

with all my heart replied the marquise let the past be forever forgotten	114.73911651967164
i promise you it affords me as little pleasure to revive it as it does you	74.10011326564228
all i ask is that villefort will be firm and inflexible for the future in his po	72.67236228535009
remember also villefort that we have pledged ourselves to his majesty for your f	58.78980235292491

unfortunately madame answered villefort the strong arm of the law is not called 	52.28004412362178

i never was in a lawcourt i am told it is so very amusing	63.98279113137363

just the person we require at a time like the present said a second	117.30335478054774
what a splendid business that last case of yours was my dear villefort remarked 	189.0380141202644

having made this wellturned speech villefort looked carefully around to mark the	116.06865411775946
do you know my dear villefort cried the comte de salvieux that is exactly what i	13.680869998393307
then the king who without our suspecting it had overheard our conversation inter	234.29413214985635
i should myself have recommended the match had not the noble marquis anticipated	302.6928172437329
is it possible the king could have condescended so far as to express himself so 	47.62092140997408
i give you his very words and if the marquis chooses to be candid he will confes	70.43539398784735

that is true answered the marquis	21.24054339050686
how much do i owe this gracious prince what is there i would not do to evince my	93.23630425839755
that is right cried the marquise	32.449036893932906
i love to see you thus	105.84162917584352
now then were a conspirator to fall into your hands he would be most welcome	100.82704852399371
for my part dear mother interposed rene i trust your wishes will not prosper and	66.11828603935214
de villeforts handsthen i shall be contented	32.17106443727088

villefort immediately rose from table and quitted the room upon the plea of urge	98.02445604858598

well i at least resemble the disciples of esculapius in one thing people spoke i	90.78520070427118
and wherefore were you called away just now asked mademoiselle de saintmran with	109.86953467088698
for a very serious matter which bids fair to make work for the executioner	176.16516715251578
how dreadful exclaimed rene turning pale	78.34660489723898
is it possible burst simultaneously from all who were near enough to the magistr	140.22600248684765
why if my information prove correct a sort of bonapartist conspiracy has just be	149.12545356250385
can i believe my ears cried the marquise	68.42785716582348
i will read you the letter containing the accusation at least said villefort	49.71055757773219
the kings attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and the religious insti	28.33388038163055
ample corroboration of this statement may be obtained by arresting the abovement	33.39109798818873
should it not be found in the possession of father or son then it will assuredly	63.271331474958004

true but that gentleman being absent his secretary by his orders opened his lett	145.93432344184293
then the guilty person is absolutely in custody said the marquise	127.76212486977313
nay dear mother say the accused person	410.209433570869
you know we can not yet pronounce him guilty	193.5163998694715
he is in safe custody answered villefort and rely upon it if the letter is found	87.1231666744707
and where is the unfortunate being asked rene	34.63405597873835
he is at my house	27.98094926631923
come come my friend interrupted the marquise do not neglect your duty to linger 	53.2683715407706
you are the kings servant and must go wherever that service calls you	265.5676478005876
oh villefort cried rene clasping her hands and looking towards her lover with pi	23.782654636095298
the young man passed round to the side of the table where the fair pleader sat a	45.88435417377584

never mind that foolish girl villefort said the marquise	58.01069908282461
she will soon get over these things	163.39809092324333
so saying madame de saintmran extended her dry bony hand to villefort who while 	57.42205083843434
these are mournful auspices to accompany a betrothal sighed poor rene	327.95698040300664

these considerations naturally gave villefort a feeling of such complete felicit	157.6229732939191
at the door he met the commissary of police who was waiting for him	24.06955540266273

how old	1287.7719711332484

at this moment and as villefort had arrived at the corner of the rue des conseil	11.952544166106277
ah m	196.80477693853996
de villefort cried he i am delighted to see you	12.187702901484647

villefort as we have seen belonged to the aristocratic party at marseilles morre	55.764806336757125

you are aware monsieur that a man may be estimable and trustworthy in private li	46.45156417546122

the magistrate laid emphasis on these words as if he wished to apply them to the	64.7238511649652

what were you doing at the moment you were arrested	31.035421016955876
i was at the festival of my marriage monsieur said the young man his voice sligh	21.24726456769028
de villefort and the radiant face of mercds	27.837633712838965
you were at the festival of your marriage said the deputy shuddering in spite of	28.151609328561218
yes monsieur i am on the point of marrying a young girl i have been attached to 	27.667755597704755
villefort impassive as he was was struck with this coincidence and the tremulous	64.51300164163779
this philosophic reflection thought he will make a great sensation at m	153.81159657548557
de saintmrans and he arranged mentally while dants awaited further questions the	311.1836175839177
when this speech was arranged villefort turned to dants	46.037063144471226

go on sir said he	12.021692115126122
what would you have me say	39.076439473236334

have you served under the usurper	130.89810712447803
i was about to be mustered into the royal marines when he fell	58.933029767031265
it is reported your political opinions are extreme said villefort who had never 	90.61907692411768
my political opinions replied dants	181.2733309889155
alas sir i never had any opinions	133.83572580140896
i am hardly nineteen i know nothing i have no part to play	75.05309676012213

this sir is all i can tell you and you see how uninteresting it is	38.58922818839635
as dants spoke villefort gazed at his ingenuous and open countenance and recolle	51.485214538249764
with the deputys knowledge of crime and criminals every word the young man utter	177.37126312348028

full of this idea villeforts face became so joyous that when he turned to dants 	43.506064533531955
sir said villefort have you any enemies at least that you know	27.88504237030014
i have enemies replied dants my position is not sufficiently elevated for that	104.76802886127184
as for my disposition that is perhaps somewhat too hasty but i have striven to r	75.4924599841531

you seem a worthy young man i will depart from the strict line of my duty to aid	85.57272246047997
here is the paper do you know the writing as he spoke villefort drew the letter 	36.847540530198124
dants read it	115.97936028575275
a cloud passed over his brow as he said	42.73889134985497
no monsieur i do not know the writing and yet it is tolerably plain	49.973069058234096
whoever did it writes well	307.5415003897633
i am very fortunate added he looking gratefully at villefort to be examined by s	101.91861420881717

at these words he gave me a ring	27.270770700365635
it was timetwo hours after he was delirious the next day he died	74.97819386884977
and what did you do then	11.561118002232483

as i had expected i found some difficulty in obtaining access to the grandmarsha	48.11196336125386
he questioned me concerning captain lecleres death and as the latter had told me	110.20618282564922
i undertook it because it was what my captain had bade me do	127.10277046689414

ah said villefort this seems to me the truth	31.57741560998482
if you have been culpable it was imprudence and this imprudence was in obedience	94.7711496621048
give up this letter you have brought from elba and pass your word you will appea	53.77173119797714
i am free then sir cried dants joyfully	73.441329881259

stop a moment said the deputy as dants took his hat and gloves	42.30311183175301
to whom is it addressed	55.21129358264757
to monsieur noirtier rue coqhron paris	17.981586615588583
had a thunderbolt fallen into the room villefort could not have been more stupef	21.82480986706919

noirtier rue coqhron no	54.8407816971257

yes said dants do you know him	11.331492997909915
no replied villefort a faithful servant of the king does not know conspirators	40.67382497217058

it is a conspiracy then asked dants who after believing himself free now began t	91.16056082144641
i have however already told you sir i was entirely ignorant of the contents of t	39.70353057006836
yes but you knew the name of the person to whom it was addressed said villefort	33.43087122027411
i was forced to read the address to know to whom to give it	80.3020473124876
have you shown this letter to anyone asked villefort becoming still more pale	74.45053072357783
to no one on my honor	45.85742857865312
everybody is ignorant that you are the bearer of a letter from the island of elb	26.23042118962147
everybody except the person who gave it to me	48.982696075312155
and that was too much far too much murmured villefort	95.39110220242961
villeforts brow darkened more and more his white lips and clenched teeth filled 	254.02899301162836
after reading the letter villefort covered his face with his hands	50.61537435210258
oh said dants timidly what is the matter villefort made no answer but raised his	39.57744450230693
and you say that you are ignorant of the contents of this letter	19.388460104111374
i give you my word of honor sir said dants but what is the matter you are illsha	14.493400653833238
no said villefort rising hastily stay where you are	72.99451436227423
it is for me to give orders here and not you	47.78633643087671
monsieur replied dants proudly it was only to summon assistance for you	71.24636489488766
i want none it was a temporary indisposition	100.65805161388353
attend to yourself answer me	327.4249314814856
dants waited expecting a question but in vain	154.26420127475672
villefort fell back on his chair passed his hand over his brow moist with perspi	26.66447378204946
oh if he knows the contents of this murmured he and that noirtier is the father 	68.94290865957653
oh it is impossible to doubt it cried he suddenly	64.78131221052274
in heavens name cried the unhappy young man if you doubt me question me i will a	63.783327319512814
villefort made a violent effort and in a tone he strove to render firm	42.33841693743773
sir said he i am no longer able as i had hoped to restore you immediately to lib	38.48358698143374
oh monsieur cried dants you have been rather a friend than a judge	40.2979558769703
0105 m	1.0097321270269466
well i must detain you some time longer but i will strive to make it as short as	73.1505443792665
the principal charge against you is this letter and you see villefort approached	246.48916074202737
you see i destroy it	83.53775545461632
oh exclaimed dants you are goodness itself	121.29567075021558
listen continued villefort you can now have confidence in me after what i have d	69.57308327788316
oh command and i will obey	105.70161930244635
listen this is not a command but advice i give you	88.47557931076574
speak and i will follow your advice	29.495227421668577
i shall detain you until this evening in the palais de justice	37.27079623713002
should anyone else interrogate you say to him what you have said to me but do no	85.81270171289994
i promise	464.1816465260845
it was villefort who seemed to entreat and the prisoner who reassured him	39.12290075332344
you see continued he glancing toward the grate where fragments of burnt paper fl	151.4399664374549
be satisfied i will deny it	75.37692416053542
it was the only letter you had	47.18970743740537
it was	3.4437149222575263

villefort whispered some words in his ear to which the officer replied by a moti	52.935831210703334
follow him said villefort to dants	8.19449589089928
dants saluted villefort and retired	44.24629135938498
hardly had the door closed when villefort threw himself halffainting into a chai	49.92850485106497
alas alas murmured he if the procureur himself had been at marseilles i should h	49.86273164212807
this accursed letter would have destroyed all my hopes	250.6127933281099
oh my father must your past career always interfere with my successes suddenly a	324.48442230052285
this will do said he and from this letter which might have ruined me i will make	58.28603066794907

the palais de justice communicated with the prisona sombre edifice that from its	170.219823811256
after numberless windings dants saw a door with an iron wicket	85.56994781620578
the commissary took up an iron mallet and knocked thrice every blow seeming to d	103.26702758359544
the door opened the two gendarmes gently pushed him forward and the door closed 	56.39336410310595
the air he inhaled was no longer pure but thick and mephitiche was in prison	116.10158956880613
he was conducted to a tolerably neat chamber but grated and barred and its appea	110.6494411460554
it was four oclock when dants was placed in this chamber	30.673101471266378
it was as we have said the 1st of march and the prisoner was soon buried in dark	49.81972679618616
the obscurity augmented the acuteness of his hearing at the slightest sound he r	143.0170791755739
at last about ten oclock and just as dants began to despair steps were heard in 	84.95834548194479
by the torchlight dants saw the glittering sabres and carbines of four gendarmes	59.806795366874276
he had advanced at first but stopped at the sight of this display of force	73.2765728604419
are you come to fetch me asked he	15.424242444391703
yes replied a gendarme	62.95641762364472
by the orders of the deputy procureur	47.44527494982751
i believe so	94.60156640552184
the conviction that they came from m	199.39876872055257
de villefort relieved all dants apprehensions he advanced calmly and placed hims	129.21231072167188
a carriage waited at the door the coachman was on the box and a police officer s	47.672506537571095
is this carriage for me said dants	29.903604383437877
it is for you replied a gendarme	33.64669778137485
dants was about to speak but feeling himself urged forward and having neither th	146.19041894722122

through the grating however dants saw they were passing through the rue caisseri	34.66311770658791
soon he saw the lights of la consigne	27.31410747474629
the carriage stopped the officer descended approached the guardhouse a dozen sol	138.47546328931017
can all this force be summoned on my account thought he	97.31413769779527
the officer opened the door which was locked and without speaking a word answere	47.56131769066321
the two gendarmes who were opposite to him descended first then he was ordered t	91.61428276490143
they advanced towards a boat which a customhouse officer held by a chain near th	86.07469399332957
the soldiers looked at dants with an air of stupid curiosity	22.20511623558771
in an instant he was placed in the sternsheets of the boat between the gendarmes	25.667887277575208
at a shout from the boat the chain that closes the mouth of the port was lowered	56.91222138395357
the prisoners first feeling was of joy at again breathing the pure airfor air is	489.7118410713343

this manuvre was incomprehensible to dants	107.48588976940907
whither are you taking me asked he	27.496252447891276
you will soon know	33.50658131172153
but still	767.2031993506283
we are forbidden to give you any explanation	34.12107855607125
dants trained in discipline knew that nothing would be more absurd than to quest	148.9002097144888
the most vague and wild thoughts passed through his mind	189.96792819556964
the boat they were in could not make a long voyage there was no vessel at anchor	165.43505186712
he was not bound nor had they made any attempt to handcuff him this seemed a goo	80.50666663506111
besides had not the deputy who had been so kind to him told him that provided he	64.64899062743946
he waited silently striving to pierce through the darkness	223.00126593279998
they had left the ile ratonneau where the lighthouse stood on the right and were	36.96895747099159
it seemed to the prisoner that he could distinguish a feminine form on the beach	38.63276136456938
how was it that a presentiment did not warn mercds that her lover was within thr	51.58043397736752
one light alone was visible and dants saw that it came from mercds chamber	68.78119151136657
mercds was the only one awake in the whole settlement	58.93165281165414
a loud cry could be heard by her	73.00140637398447
but pride restrained him and he did not utter it	135.23640343540046
what would his guards think if they heard him shout like a madman	189.12790541442786
he remained silent his eyes fixed upon the light the boat went on but the prison	96.6548138406083
an intervening elevation of land hid the light	196.53300533790147

have you no idea whatever	35.26896998259266
none at all	66.1777108310079
that is impossible	24.261921385896287

i do not	5.67908868030735
look round you then	272.82015603276074
dants rose and looked forward when he saw rise within a hundred yards of him the	99.06508266118797

the gendarme smiled	481.91247402056274
i am not going there to be imprisoned said dants it is only used for political p	40.19591613730348
i have committed no crime	231.6393987238131

dants pressed the gendarmes hand as though he would crush it	76.45029834160626
you think then said he that i am taken to the chteau dif to be imprisoned there	34.368054848815206
it is probable but there is no occasion to squeeze so hard	48.93990182136259
without any inquiry without any formality	181.87593790333534
all the formalities have been gone through the inquiry is already made	137.9564501799637

de villeforts promises	145.20368678266658
i do not know what m	12.921030417562276

but what are you doing help comrades help	148.12463200877627
by a rapid movement which the gendarmes practiced eye had perceived dants sprang	105.59069133316379
he fell back cursing with rage	143.821726749447
good said the gendarme placing his knee on his chest this is the way you keep yo	30.88517804458587
and he levelled his carbine at dants who felt the muzzle against his temple	56.28163753816466
for a moment the idea of struggling crossed his mind and of so ending the unexpe	51.96971694009649
but he bethought him of m	171.1501786058363
de villeforts promise and besides death in a boat from the hand of a gendarme se	52.782633831411104
he remained motionless but gnashing his teeth and wringing his hands with fury	103.28396806820145
at this moment the boat came to a landing with a violent shock	35.07844742290157
one of the sailors leaped on shore a cord creaked as it ran through a pulley and	66.0681445615291
his guards taking him by the arms and coatcollar forced him to rise and dragged 	134.11336574718203
dants made no resistance he was like a man in a dream he saw soldiers drawn up o	56.03784144451243
he did not even see the ocean that terrible barrier against freedom which the pr	103.98152089122007
they halted for a minute during which he strove to collect his thoughts	36.240301981570134
he looked around he was in a court surrounded by high walls he heard the measure	64.13870061506611
they waited upwards of ten minutes	93.19754447518837
certain dants could not escape the gendarmes released him	65.77270339757048
they seemed awaiting orders	1303.645370306495
the orders came	841.7954507719444
where is the prisoner said a voice	22.801700301415767
here replied the gendarmes	73.41636518256956
let him follow me i will take him to his cell	39.260912653228964
go said the gendarmes thrusting dants forward	186.18838000532256
the prisoner followed his guide who led him into a room almost under ground whos	110.3274833123267

here is your chamber for tonight said he	62.32691532207188
it is late and the governor is asleep	60.42182057302514
tomorrow perhaps he may change you	170.0511609486261
in the meantime there is bread water and fresh straw and that is all a prisoner 	105.59129552967467

dants was alone in darkness and in silencecold as the shadows that he felt breat	56.87795658330278
with the first dawn of day the jailer returned with orders to leave dants where 	70.32739643433229
he found the prisoner in the same position as if fixed there his eyes swollen wi	51.19311493786932
he had passed the night standing and without sleep	108.40600910680094
the jailer advanced dants appeared not to perceive him	72.88773659164781
he touched him on the shoulder	45.62892605281099
edmond started	311.581243524102
have you not slept said the jailer	46.08173554347792
i do not know replied dants	7.685707464339104
the jailer stared	1050.7216315993144
are you hungry continued he	81.28311045534116
i do not know	5.250953686610398
do you wish for anything	19.892629629611648
i wish to see the governor	26.409073076530657
the jailer shrugged his shoulders and left the chamber	47.7196419411165
dants followed him with his eyes and stretched forth his hands towards the open 	36.81686681651516
all his emotion then burst forth he cast himself on the ground weeping bitterly 	153.3258073150231
the day passed thus he scarcely tasted food but walked round and round the cell 	300.8472236873038
one thought in particular tormented him namely that during his journey hither he	429.41577127506145
he had no fears as to how he should livegood seamen are welcome everywhere	245.29496702209622
he spoke italian like a tuscan and spanish like a castilian he would have been f	36.309966964932386
the thought was maddening and dants threw himself furiously down on his straw	96.34848842777319
the next morning at the same hour the jailer came again	19.944388325975286
well said the jailer are you more reasonable today dants made no reply	68.08169425612324

he descended fifteen steps and the door of a dungeon was opened and he was thrus	31.516567592547045
the door closed and dants advanced with outstretched hands until he touched the 	48.46492311368745

the guests looked at each other	17.767387882962282
you wish to speak to me alone said the marquis	23.444717536400592
yes let us go to the library please	35.371731713111345
the marquis took his arm and they left the salon	53.362028627429474
well asked he as soon as they were by themselves tell me what it is	53.98903526733473
an affair of the greatest importance that demands my immediate presence in paris	138.668141412094
now excuse the indiscretion marquis but have you any landed property	316.6872022872017

then give me a letter to him and tell him to sell out without an instants delay 	41.610907060400564
the deuce you say replied the marquis let us lose no time then	72.69457817816846
and sitting down he wrote a letter to his broker ordering him to sell out at the	72.56183442032507

i want a letter that will enable me to reach the kings presence without all the 	62.892117709344106

doubtless but there is no occasion to divide the honors of my discovery with him	67.894829358224
the keeper would leave me in the background and take all the glory to himself	77.92674022153815
i tell you marquis my fortune is made if i only reach the tuileries the first fo	64.23315143788443

now then go said the marquis	48.977172510759836
i shall be gone only a few moments	72.81502944786229
villefort hastily quitted the apartment but reflecting that the sight of the dep	70.94704853800644
at his door he perceived a figure in the shadow that seemed to wait for him	54.480380330992006
it was mercds who hearing no news of her lover had come unobserved to inquire af	51.83177053693104
as villefort drew near she advanced and stood before him	69.63826955836915
dants had spoken of mercds and villefort instantly recognized her	41.65731271997741
her beauty and high bearing surprised him and when she inquired what had become 	259.54037475334553
the young man you speak of said villefort abruptly is a great criminal and i can	53.792221748343664
mercds burst into tears and as villefort strove to pass her again addressed him	119.43309362370374

the man he sacrificed to his ambition that innocent victim immolated on the alta	114.32912871697998

in this case he was not the judge but the executioner	39.746472889056854
as he thus reflected he felt the sensation we have described and which had hithe	73.14482413571139
it is thus that a wounded man trembles instinctively at the approach of the fing	44.0988706633458

he started when he saw rene for he fancied she was again about to plead for dant	77.20808746288917

who employed in writing a note did not even raise his head	171.75975143251821
bonaparte continued the baron is mortally wearied and passes whole days in watch	629.7923894104397
and scratches himself for amusement added the king	188.41482168765162
scratches himself inquired the duke what does your majesty mean	57.771064555865344
yes indeed my dear duke	35.28495027946737
did you forget that this great man this hero this demigod is attacked with a mal	82.25203506030044
and moreover my dear duke continued the minister of police we are almost assured	64.24197312458521

in person	356.19803373973883
why did you not mention his name at once replied the king betraying some uneasin	51.72221228190057
sire i thought his name was unknown to your majesty	51.442883091029934

he himself	9427.805991264579
and your majesty has employed the son of such a man	44.4866605203181
blacas my friend you have but limited comprehension	171.9509337945827
i told you villefort was ambitious and to attain this ambition villefort would s	96.16448072153929
then sire may i present him	245.9093374725138
this instant duke where is he	221.52154377984687

seek him at once	31.773563734746947
i hasten to do so	44.167201399204224
the duke left the royal presence with the speed of a young man his really sincer	56.53417667467148
louis xviii	2.0032973060176347
remained alone and turning his eyes on his halfopened horace muttered	54.78040817079285
justum et tenacem propositi virum	346.7517030484811
de blacas returned as speedily as he had departed but in the antechamber he was 	27.67649075156556
villeforts dusty garb his costume which was not of courtly cut excited the susce	186.1937957579051
de brez who was all astonishment at finding that this young man had the audacity	58.015042125522804
the duke however overcame all difficulties with a wordhis majestys order and in 	255.105087377168
the king was seated in the same place where the duke had left him	19.458539789760366
on opening the door villefort found himself facing him and the young magistrates	69.72266418699927
come in m	205.89294278874877
de villefort said the king come in	18.91597818187491
villefort bowed and advancing a few steps waited until the king should interroga	43.95916174263439
de villefort said louis xviii	10.526261742107765
the duc de blacas assures me you have some interesting information to communicat	37.29120419381538
sire the duke is right and i believe your majesty will think it equally importan	38.38206905282648
0137 m	1.0127629039648876
in the first place and before everything else sir is the news as bad in your opi	77.1742980600116
sire i believe it to be most urgent but i hope by the speed i have used that it 	59.119947349994135
speak as fully as you please sir said the king who began to give way to the emot	30.344334126024215
speak sir and pray begin at the beginning i like order in everything	255.53814075790453
sire said villefort i will render a faithful report to your majesty but i must e	26.38401265511229
a glance at the king after this discreet and subtle exordium assured villefort o	162.9727659840034
sire i have come as rapidly to paris as possible to inform your majesty that i h	46.409553877808705
sire the usurper is arming three ships he meditates some project which however m	195.75475412766733
at this moment he will have left elba to go whither i know not but assuredly to 	47.14511868588378
your majesty is well aware that the sovereign of the island of elba has maintain	28.37061259891338
i am sir said the king much agitated and recently we have had information that t	95.65460210577562
but proceed i beg of you	56.25716735468612
how did you obtain these details	60.48085507792869
sire they are the results of an examination which i have made of a man of marsei	35.791267990988075
this person a sailor of turbulent character and whom i suspected of bonapartism 	103.17292063434913
there he saw the grandmarshal who charged him with an oral message to a bonapart	51.206640296086015
and where is this man	29.249196640004886
in prison sire	446.6520758537079
and the matter seems serious to you	91.3779895453375
so serious sire that when the circumstance surprised me in the midst of a family	109.55120432095819
true said louis xviii	25.974731123175122
was there not a marriage engagement between you and mademoiselle de saintmran	77.94483844676702
daughter of one of your majestys most faithful servants	95.22567668702412
yes yes but let us talk of this plot m	40.873546714018026
de villefort	1.0455435524259682
sire i fear it is more than a plot i fear it is a conspiracy	39.51343532868223
a conspiracy in these times said louis xviii	138.6162452593603
smiling is a thing very easy to meditate but more difficult to conduct to an end	89.5826384006618
for the last ten months my ministers have redoubled their vigilance in order to 	85.97563071888312
if bonaparte landed at naples the whole coalition would be on foot before he cou	47.62291970528527
take courage sir but at the same time rely on our royal gratitude	117.73658320240936
ah here is m	101.60437522370465
dandr cried de blacas	38.73339088631716
at this instant the minister of police appeared at the door pale trembling and a	30.356418402149988
villefort was about to retire but m	55.719062459481925
de blacas taking his hand restrained him	57.765334982833835
chapter 11	2723.793833382716
the corsican ogre	110.32169655729415
at the sight of this agitation louis xviii	29.047681936350738
pushed from him violently the table at which he was sitting	72.24097186982254
what ails you baron he exclaimed	66.5410938725275
you appear quite aghast	1048.3509635086366
has your uneasiness anything to do with what m	61.85940207359361
de blacas has told me and m	23.15904652435642
de villefort has just confirmed m	56.779103269429065
de blacas moved suddenly towards the baron but the fright of the courtier pleade	69.68045409569248
sire stammered the baron	292.57539132838434
well what is it asked louis xviii	17.599060769984227
the minister of police giving way to an impulse of despair was about to throw hi	80.55616471223212
who retreated a step and frowned	315.2803725725753
will you speak he said	31.819397677413328
oh sire what a dreadful misfortune i am indeed to be pitied	42.503081050284074
i can never forgive myself	128.55325693729753
monsieur said louis xviii	19.044535399890183
i command you to speak	78.65920832647697
well sire the usurper left elba on the 26th february and landed on the 1st of ma	70.63986077738568
and where in italy asked the king eagerly	56.12948891584624
in france sireat a small port near antibes in the gulf of juan	63.23987186154893
the usurper landed in france near antibes in the gulf of juan two hundred and fi	48.26276473957857
you must have received a false report or you have gone mad	98.7807413721075
alas sire it is but too true louis made a gesture of indescribable anger and ala	67.53825432518995
in france he cried the usurper in france then they did not watch over this man	86.50784633212864
who knows they were perhaps in league with him	124.81186192965811
oh sire exclaimed the duc de blacas m	32.28145085439796
dandr is not a man to be accused of treason sire we have all been blind and the 	54.81651975185799
but said villefort and then suddenly checking himself he was silent then he cont	63.58821472930477
will your majesty deign to excuse me	20.514045941708574
speak sir speak boldly replied louis	571.2295797240647
you alone forewarned us of the evil now try and aid us with the remedy	301.3176936467028
sire said villefort the usurper is detested in the south and it seems to me that	13.295412262478848
yes assuredly replied the minister but he is advancing by gap and sisteron	69.144196874559
advancinghe is advancing said louis xviii	74.36300179329922
is he then advancing on paris the minister of police maintained a silence which 	82.20866826245768
and dauphin sir inquired the king of villefort	37.61053842576044
do you think it possible to rouse that as well as provence	35.26388303896577
sire i am sorry to tell your majesty a cruel fact but the feeling in dauphin is 	51.2018791578187
the mountaineers are bonapartists sire	669.0280559533734
then murmured louis he was well informed	157.90025847231516
and how many men had he with him	64.8325483082273
i do not know sire answered the minister of police	30.80507041543385
what you do not know have you neglected to obtain information on that point of c	70.77087702462562
sire it was impossible to learn the despatch simply stated the fact of the landi	65.75724332041982
and how did this despatch reach you inquired the king	64.95285563597542
the minister bowed his head and while a deep color overspread his cheeks he stam	33.379834990887
by the telegraph sire	81.76600109510518
louis xviii	1.8819763792643094
advanced a step and folded his arms over his chest as napoleon would have done	50.29498300389688
0141 m	1.0039564368786449
so then he exclaimed turning pale with anger seven conjoined and allied armies o	53.10622176918333
a miracle of heaven replaced me on the throne of my fathers after fiveandtwenty 	80.21111941518932
i have during those fiveandtwenty years spared no pains to understand the people	237.96557184160983
sire it is fatality murmured the minister feeling that the pressure of circumsta	54.10140866968722
what our enemies say of us is then true	196.76855655339406
we have learnt nothing forgotten nothing if i were betrayed as he was i would co	94.27693000819815
the minister quailed before this outburst of sarcasm	384.05110256183394
de blacas wiped the moisture from his brow	37.940792756105616
villefort smiled within himself for he felt his increased importance	248.61105438055105
to fall continued king louis who at the first glance had sounded the abyss on wh	236.41642635003177
than thus descend the staircase at the tuileries driven away by ridicule	146.859618982403
ridicule sirwhy you know not its power in france and yet you ought to know it	76.32063096944023
sire sire murmured the minister for pitys	79.76832922240742
approach m	62.67632589966071
de villefort resumed the king addressing the young man who motionless and breath	36.935285377049425
approach and tell monsieur that it is possible to know beforehand all that he ha	56.13880377851904
sire it was really impossible to learn secrets which that man concealed from all	162.5931220581797
really impossible yesthat is a great word sir	105.71916081381788
unfortunately there are great words as there are great men i have measured them	113.51852264046398
really impossible for a minister who has an office agents spies and fifteen hund	126.37858385461088
the look of the minister of police was turned with concentrated spite on villefo	138.47420872031182
i do not mean that for you blacas continued louis xviii	37.96867307351997
for if you have discovered nothing at least you have had the good sense to perse	48.01997541319105
any other than yourself would have considered the disclosure of m	65.22162714585694
de villefort insignificant or else dictated by venal ambition	268.58983118868997
these words were an allusion to the sentiments which the minister of police had 	35.441459225484444
villefort understood the kings intent	147.2158632590116
any other person would perhaps have been overcome by such an intoxicating draugh	35.7489252068515
in fact the minister who in the plenitude of his power had been unable to uneart	29.657610516735833
realizing this villefort came to the rescue of the crestfallen minister instead 	138.5749405542528
sire said villefort the suddenness of this event must prove to your majesty that	32.34895805427135
do not attribute to me more than i deserve sire that your majesty may never have	45.53824371151706
the minister of police thanked the young man by an eloquent look and villefort u	30.123551056309886
tis well resumed the king	32.69376170373588
and now gentlemen he continued turning towards m	102.61536154555286
de blacas and the minister of police i have no further occasion for you and you 	28.36801531065029
fortunately sire said m	58.42817006523831
de blacas we can rely on the army your majesty knows how every report confirms t	109.64417530183249
do not mention reports duke to me for i know now what confidence to place in the	173.48236549747858
yet speaking of reports baron what have you learned with regard to the affair in	152.9091275286721
the affair in the rue saintjacques exclaimed villefort unable to repress an excl	40.997368868305095
then suddenly pausing he added your pardon sire but my devotion to your majesty 	178.10241353220542
go on go on sir replied the king you have today earned the right to make inquiri	46.190434527008804
sire interposed the minister of police i came a moment ago to give your majesty 	57.98041747478069
on the contrary siron the contrary said louis xviii	62.83786049612698
this affair seems to me to have a decided connection with that which occupies ou	76.47027793186032
at the name of general quesnel villefort trembled	26.265109028372322
everything points to the conclusion sire said the minister of police that death 	103.24496972263893
general quesnel it appears had just left a bonapartist club when he disappeared	81.21457503478335
an unknown person had been with him that morning and made an appointment with hi	67.4742937937065
as the police minister related this to the king villefort who looked as if his v	67.14083005908951
the king looked towards him	30.223950186930313
do you not think with me m	27.393345303769966
de villefort that general quesnel whom they believed attached to the usurper but	116.10208782384356
it is probable sire replied villefort	23.346139370552823
but is this all that is known	106.09093747622438
they are on the track of the man who appointed the meeting with him	32.24903410054251
on his track said villefort	27.691328356848366
yes the servant has given his description	112.57159512278574
he is a man of from fifty to fiftytwo years of age dark with black eyes covered 	39.714427499471235
he was dressed in a blue frockcoat buttoned up to the chin and wore at his butto	28.948588054641995
yesterday a person exactly corresponding with this description was followed but 	387.6042246077102
villefort leaned on the back of an armchair for as the minister of police went o	60.3551302735781
continue to seek for this man sir said the king to the minister of police for if	30.37445969622037
it required all villeforts coolness not to betray the terror with which this dec	168.73883510484708
how strange continued the king with some asperity the police think that they hav	73.37020460880751
sire your majesty will i trust be amply satisfied on this point at least	78.62099733213492
we shall see	9.786064342037534
i will no longer detain you m	51.33647230360744
de villefort for you must be fatigued after so long a journey go and rest	86.31673951144111
of course you stopped at your fathers a feeling of faintness came over villefort	88.2650987948598
0145 m	1.0148406031917594
no sire he replied i alighted at the hotel de madrid in the rue de tournon	18.372562674116292
but you have seen him	12.381833335381229
sire i went straight to the duc de blacas	16.403471363818202
but you will see him then	16.780889950372654
i think not sire	117.41281389286846
ah i forgot said louis smiling in a manner which proved that all these questions	62.126658867771674
noirtier are not on the best terms possible and that is another sacrifice made t	91.44908380593613
sire the kindness your majesty deigns to evince towards me is a recompense which	117.04728641707922
never mind sir we will not forget you make your mind easy	69.3995292946178
in the meanwhile the king here detached the cross of the legion of honor which h	60.34079974987995
louis above the order of notredamedumontcarmel and st	43.7571823548686
lazare and gave it to villefortin the meanwhile take this cross	126.22224047648942
sire said villefort your majesty mistakes this is an officers cross	84.63467069677009
ma foi said louis xviii	6.4209271053727175
take it such as it is for i have not the time to procure you another	50.38378462730402

de villefort	1.0573194027061115
villeforts eyes were filled with tears of joy and pride he took the cross and ki	38.87447730806392
and now he said may i inquire what are the orders with which your majesty deigns	76.33791937082975
take what rest you require and remember that if you are not able to serve me her	76.6255526663697

one passed at the moment which he hailed he gave his address to the driver and s	70.68571918621338
ten minutes afterwards villefort reached his hotel ordered horses to be ready in	47.574598101032656
he was about to begin his repast when the sound of the bell rang sharp and loud	61.32148997248261
the valet opened the door and villefort heard someone speak his name	74.38605374311608

a stranger who will not send in his name	54.73312285423938
a stranger who will not send in his name what can he want with me	54.80130922442489
he wishes to speak to you	25.26853982521838

in a blue frockcoat buttoned up close decorated with the legion of honor	74.33212338005967

noirtierfor it was indeed he who enteredlooked after the servant until the door 	62.953445717824714
noirtier then took the trouble to close and bolt the antechamber door then that 	90.9624719495223
well now my dear grard said he to the young man with a very significant look do 	16.367444735024094
my dear father said villefort i am on the contrary delighted but i so little exp	26.93970002718282
but my dear fellow replied m	22.870061370534767
noirtier seating himself i might say the same thing to you when you announce to 	85.71512524944264
and if i have come my dear father said grard drawing closer to m	30.992223690081634
noirtier do not complain for it is for you that i came and my journey will be yo	39.12861900616434
ah indeed said m	31.452987085879478
noirtier stretching himself out at his ease in the chair	110.49232274321582
really pray tell me all about it for it must be interesting	59.26301827680494
father you have heard speak of a certain bonapartist club in the rue saintjacque	35.354354996762694
53 yes i am vicepresident	119.63891771744208
father your coolness makes me shudder	244.59930730437563
why my dear boy when a man has been proscribed by the mountaineers has escaped f	41.77529139896887
but go on what about the club in the rue saintjacques	38.06299875935691
why they induced general quesnel to go there and general quesnel who quitted his	179.94045659143956
0151 m	1.0114567281898723
and who told you this fine story	57.22991219190146
the king himself	135.27374583486235
well then in return for your story continued noirtier i will tell you another	42.20508020983319
my dear father i think i already know what you are about to tell me	31.02544080309041
ah you have heard of the landing of the emperor	46.33886985512812
not so loud father i entreat of youfor your own sake as well as mine	108.56911660747576
yes i heard this news and knew it even before you could for three days ago i pos	65.15330494639156
three days ago you are crazy	47.9714224868228
why three days ago the emperor had not landed	93.70777467981652
no matter i was aware of his intention	37.12758901574025
how did you know about it	18.624107334966737
by a letter addressed to you from the island of elba	46.33495901135055
to me	38.60967686868097
to you and which i discovered in the pocketbook of the messenger	78.20749314715047
had that letter fallen into the hands of another you my dear father would probab	82.95895174653384
villeforts father laughed	5779.28347895491
come come said he will the restoration adopt imperial methods so promptly shot m	310.85986403678237
i burnt it for fear that even a fragment should remain for that letter must have	235.44128082337028
and the destruction of your future prospects replied noirtier yes i can easily c	79.4564705546594
but i have nothing to fear while i have you to protect me	37.209018355616344
i do better than that siri save you	94.30404161601341
you do why really the thing becomes more and more dramaticexplain yourself	163.94299500050374
i must refer again to the club in the rue saintjacques	56.530834031571814
it appears that this club is rather a bore to the police	124.54783576378614
why did nt they search more vigilantly they would have found	138.45360900246348
they have not found but they are on the track	40.02361183696513
yes that the usual phrase i am quite familiar with it	95.72226813254346
when the police is at fault it declares that it is on the track and the governme	44.37531573658059
yes but they have found a corpse the general has been killed and in all countrie	58.627238951893524
a murder do you call it why there is nothing to prove that the general was murde	65.2340994764787
people are found every day in the seine having thrown themselves in or having be	163.9748149516164
father you know very well that the general was not a man to drown himself in des	49.55627216065629
no no do not be deceived this was murder in every sense of the word	108.31568911412568
and who thus designated it	417.10244831320153
the king himself	130.70562966312815
the king i thought he was philosopher enough to allow that there was no murder i	119.2666874579099
in politics my dear fellow you know as well as i do there are no men but ideasno	48.607060441105006
would you like to know how matters have progressed well i will tell you	59.19941359508901
it was thought reliance might be placed in general quesnel he was recommended to	158.16076002239836
he came there and the plan was unfolded to him for leaving elba the projected la	103.28721859518248
when he had heard and comprehended all to the fullest extent he replied that he 	91.45811075993002
then all looked at each otherhe was made to take an oath and did so but with suc	89.62241613327991
yet he did not return home	28.331590419506785
what could that mean why my dear fellow that on leaving us he lost his way that 	122.8704469775645
a murder really villefort you surprise me	271.20028032749997
you a deputy procureur to found an accusation on such bad premises did i ever sa	235.77135286663486
but father take care when our turn comes our revenge will be sweeping	245.66181173775874
i do not understand you	7.938947276221227
you rely on the usurpers return	172.59981454895737
we do	51.23806269805517
you are mistaken he will not advance two leagues into the interior of france wit	50.62151715645279
my dear fellow the emperor is at this moment on the way to grenoble on the 10th 	26.164807015664255
the people will rise	314.357151937956
yes to go and meet him	82.62551751356709
he has but a handful of men with him and armies will be despatched against him	76.58723398230592
yes to escort him into the capital	233.94102767060028
really my dear grard you are but a child you think yourself well informed becaus	56.32467397724264
he is pursued	242.9405893189071
but where is he what is he doing you do not know at all and in this way they wil	34.88208392790327
grenoble and lyons are faithful cities and will oppose to him an impassable barr	52.11316164480548
grenoble will open her gates to him with enthusiasmall lyons will hasten to welc	102.71473919484983
believe me we are as well informed as you and our police are as good as your own	41.34127363075806
would you like a proof of it well you wished to conceal your journey from me and	39.030833649209505
you gave your direction to no one but your postilion yet i have your address and	159.95232972206227
ring then if you please for a second knife fork and plate and we will dine toget	74.02549078361
indeed replied villefort looking at his father with astonishment you really do s	47.03295077351315
eh the thing is simple enough	88.19811999913371
you who are in power have only the means that money produceswe who are in expect	218.75269328256337
devotion said villefort with a sneer	16.057487642056614
yes devotion for that is i believe the phrase for hopeful ambition	173.93188371988998
and villeforts father extended his hand to the bellrope to summon the servant wh	64.66785952958256
villefort caught his arm	108.89087576652
wait my dear father said the young man one word more	15.647965969950432
say on	289.69923651775775
however stupid the royalist police may be they do know one terrible thing	581.5313942851069
what is that	7.123117834289889
the description of the man who on the morning of the day when general quesnel di	51.259225362993035
oh the admirable police have found that out have they and what may be that descr	177.97031792236737
dark complexion hair eyebrows and whiskers black blue frockcoat buttoned up to t	37.81925863066263
ah ha that s it is it said noirtier and why then have they not laid hands on him	60.610396531934384
because yesterday or the day before they lost sight of him at the corner of the 	48.51617323290678
did nt i say that your police were good for nothing	92.47522978982249
yes but they may catch him yet	122.05199885769167
true said noirtier looking carelessly around him true if this person were not on	89.31030940652786
at these words he rose and put off his frockcoat and cravat went towards a table	58.224196394350706
villefort watched him with alarm not devoid of admiration	112.6364035026355
his whiskers cut off noirtier gave another turn to his hair took instead of his 	178.3715768816168
well he said turning towards his wondering son when this disguise was completed 	117.72664663327747
no father stammered villefort at least i hope not	76.9055414408966
and now my dear boy continued noirtier i rely on your prudence to remove all the	45.84648568827781
oh rely on me said villefort	42.816036127158746
yes yes and now i believe you are right and that you have really saved my life b	34.412347260718995
villefort shook his head	11.986120910732604
you are not convinced yet	91.20051735014766
i hope at least that you may be mistaken	32.023377675345124
shall you see the king again	14.54807617349565
would you pass in his eyes for a prophet	78.39892436020847
prophets of evil are not in favor at the court father	100.51871540583967
true but some day they do them justice and supposing a second restoration you wo	157.57269894495928
well what should i say to the king	20.110765602965138

adieu my dear grard and at your next journey alight at my door	81.75793075641114
noirtier left the room when he had finished with the same calmness that had char	28.389199615803488
villefort pale and agitated ran to the window put aside the curtain and saw him 	54.56222133383431
villefort stood watching breathless until his father had disappeared at the rue 	107.71842073417537
then he turned to the various articles he had left behind him put the black crav	43.40083694786135

the hundred days	606.9068157512216
noirtier was a true prophet and things progressed rapidly as he had predicted	117.0399193995341
everyone knows the history of the famous return from elba a return which was unp	89.89745432435168

villefort therefore gained nothing save the kings gratitude which was rather lik	264.54957924517396

villefort retained his place but his marriage was put off until a more favorable	180.29731853230433

morrel was announced	62.395159572683525
anyone else would have hastened to receive him but villefort was a man of abilit	29.506804711207476
he made morrel wait in the antechamber although he had no one with him for the s	42.86893672974308
morrel to be admitted	92.00759149873006
morrel expected villefort would be dejected he found him as he had found him six	74.42344855572897
he had entered villeforts office expecting that the magistrate would tremble at 	133.47392180656496
he stopped at the door villefort gazed at him as if he had some difficulty in re	25.43076771432999
morrel i believe said villefort	24.53723442271941
yes sir	26.426267881165973
come nearer said the magistrate with a patronizing wave of the hand and tell me 	33.2369546177969
do you not guess monsieur asked morrel	19.712174855551083
not in the least but if i can serve you in any way i shall be delighted	24.142108988647713
everything depends on you	253.9186671241612
explain yourself pray	270.9657982286391
monsieur said morrel recovering his assurance as he proceeded do you recollect t	53.558940938902694
you then served louis xviii	245.3992056517415
and you did not show any favorit was your duty today you serve napoleon and you 	91.5637967117891
0161 m	1.0953916281185354
villefort by a strong effort sought to control himself	47.33442423362994
what is his name said he	14.22255415406231
tell me his name	23.598279822445324
edmond dants	14.589038126010836
villefort would probably have rather stood opposite the muzzle of a pistol at fi	93.85440598386668
dants repeated he edmond dants	89.1324752312157
yes monsieur	149.5107187774396
villefort opened a large register then went to a table from the table turned to 	62.38355724261452
are you quite sure you are not mistaken monsieur said he in the most natural ton	21.908558203614
had morrel been a more quicksighted man or better versed in these matters he wou	92.45155347020712
but morrel disappointed in his expectations of exciting fear was conscious only 	242.29851010147382
villefort had calculated rightly	300.66179336694233
no said morrel i am not mistaken	7.04251822671796
i have known him for ten years the last four of which he was in my service	42.06958556781572
do not you recollect i came about six weeks ago to plead for clemency as i come 	82.51385770141765
you received me very coldly	518.9448814528006
oh the royalists were very severe with the bonapartists in those days	82.08516306288445
monsieur returned villefort i was then a royalist because i believed the bourbon	62.09573879605472
the miraculous return of napoleon has conquered me the legitimate monarch is he 	189.12159269487648
that s right cried morrel	9.491281134845229
i like to hear you speak thus and i augur well for edmond from it	155.90744402659018
wait a moment said villefort turning over the leaves of a register i have ita sa	49.54050146405537
i recollect now it was a very serious charge	127.3008074986116
how so	24.83442219098579
you know that when he left here he was taken to the palais de justice	28.970661780432703
i made my report to the authorities at paris and a week after he was carried off	60.22466979212897
carried off said morrel	82.63595888624482
what can they have done with him	35.72425051604817
oh he has been taken to fenestrelles to pignerol or to the saintemargurite islan	19.416182961864294
some fine morning he will return to take command of your vessel	123.93000499594328
come when he will it shall be kept for him	50.782751176594246
but how is it he is not already returned it seems to me the first care of govern	47.812160284880726
do not be too hasty m	76.86847557056682
morrel replied villefort	25.85060175665258
the order of imprisonment came from high authority and the order for his liberat	97.41279404090726
but said morrel is there no way of expediting all these formalitiesof releasing 	94.88387633239992
there has been no arrest	173.02542830441897
it is sometimes essential to government to cause a mans disappearance without le	219.4128184842794
it might be so under the bourbons but at present	53.75450363669626
it has always been so my dear morrel since the reign of louis xiv	39.50689787799669
the emperor is more strict in prison discipline than even louis himself and the 	290.85527692100453
had morrel even any suspicions so much kindness would have dispelled them	161.41230041046714
well m	193.20024465548454
de villefort how would you advise me to act asked he	35.481796647054594
petition the minister	87.81891823005921
oh i know what that is the minister receives two hundred petitions every day and	71.2106343517356
that is true but he will read a petition countersigned and presented by me	79.52598716787593
and will you undertake to deliver it	58.822890792449094
with the greatest pleasure	123.3522305907391
dants was then guilty and now he is innocent and it is as much my duty to free h	57.015873739872106
villefort thus forestalled any danger of an inquiry which however improbable it 	294.03845999831134
but how shall i address the minister	77.84180536024996
sit down there said villefort giving up his place to morrel and write what i dic	26.245559800279235
will you be so good	11.84293425486118
but lose no time we have lost too much already	180.2007973038931
that is true	6.919347017217183
only think what the poor fellow may even now be suffering	198.53076974543924
villefort shuddered at the suggestion but he had gone too far to draw back	49.52235070506411
dants must be crushed to gratify villeforts ambition	188.9843882200236
villefort dictated a petition in which from an excellent intention no doubt dant	110.91324738032503
it was evident that at the sight of this document the minister would instantly r	29.43470008782783
the petition finished villefort read it aloud	376.22566366812475
that will do said he leave the rest to me	55.41987891061091
will the petition go soon	315.8932917903709
countersigned by you	93.38277668584115
the best thing i can do will be to certify the truth of the contents of your pet	45.7478335216656
and sitting down villefort wrote the certificate at the bottom	98.04105075768432
what more is to be done	66.99011164140349
i will do whatever is necessary	115.93932762994542
this assurance delighted morrel who took leave of villefort and hastened to anno	61.987787471325774
as for villefort instead of sending to paris he carefully preserved the petition	103.71184624632386
dants remained a prisoner and heard not the noise of the fall of louis xviii	58.59252831892674
s throne or the still more tragic destruction of the empire	442.4283279212157
twice during the hundred days had morrel renewed his demand and twice had villef	130.60071598438057
at last there was waterloo and morrel came no more he had done all that was in h	48.34208827907948
louis xviii	1.9238260710332074
remounted the throne villefort to whom marseilles had become filled with remorse	116.40647773074672
and so dants after the hundred days and after waterloo remained in his dungeon f	64.51127898164115
danglars comprehended the full extent of the wretched fate that overwhelmed dant	215.4686900028633

he guessed something uncommon was passing among the living but he had so long ce	220.93860240194553
the inspector visited one after another the cells and dungeons of several of the	216.98753232269783
he inquired how they were fed and if they had any request to make	46.262259803351974
the universal response was that the fare was detestable and that they wanted to 	115.21939492372628
the inspector asked if they had anything else to ask for	86.12215348855185
they shook their heads	132.18355344524352
what could they desire beyond their liberty the inspector turned smilingly to th	193.96538034610336
i do not know what reason government can assign for these useless visits when yo	231.38152119345483
are there any others	187.65967966798155
yes the dangerous and mad prisoners are in the dungeons	229.02752255436516
let us visit them said the inspector with an air of fatigue	16.218021096645845
we must play the farce to the end	46.29719327676468
let us see the dungeons	22.110089658850452
let us first send for two soldiers said the governor	55.78132162629238
the prisoners sometimes through mere uneasiness of life and in order to be sente	98.99354306726984
take all needful precautions replied the inspector	109.02086517863104
two soldiers were accordingly sent for and the inspector descended a stairway so	158.87831573775892
oh cried the inspector who can live here	62.02099008464794
a most dangerous conspirator a man we are ordered to keep the most strict watch 	148.48925518153672
he is alone	52.753295259350075
how long has he been there	62.89238761361139
nearly a year	65.31776612694063
was he placed here when he first arrived	99.24645311958922
no not until he attempted to kill the turnkey who took his food to him	84.18431917316022
to kill the turnkey	116.37889405316037
yes the very one who is lighting us	168.00333997611878
is it not true antoine asked the governor	17.385095030131268
true enough he wanted to kill me returned the turnkey	59.578857871294176
he must be mad said the inspector	32.475878008937386
he is worse than thathe is a devil returned the turnkey	96.14040996579922
shall i complain of him demanded the inspector	43.741327789490896
oh no it is useless	14.474804747973657
besides he is almost mad now and in another year he will be quite so	75.96814892827717
so much the better for himhe will suffer less said the inspector	68.73892861643476
he was as this remark shows a man full of philanthropy and in every way fit for 	88.53111672635148
you are right sir replied the governor and this remark proves that you have deep	40.94076455354332

this was the inspectors first visit he wished to display his authority	140.07403395513987
let us visit this one first added he	77.45318954601115
by all means replied the governor and he signed to the turnkey to open the door	32.21443783346413
at the sound of the key turning in the lock and the creaking of the hinges dants	22.094375763251062

then infusing all the humility he possessed into his eyes and voice he addressed	145.32102420829403
the inspector listened attentively then turning to the governor observed he will	161.04166683419677
then turning to the prisoner what is it you want said he	24.778366429356957
i want to know what crime i have committedto be tried and if i am guilty to be s	78.42378834314196
are you well fed said the inspector	24.435548100018266
i believe so i do nt know its of no consequence	75.97119184186259
what matters really not only to me but to officers of justice and the king is th	85.270611862426
you are very humble today remarked the governor you are not so always the other 	102.0297224888203
it is true sir and i beg his pardon for he has always been very good to me but i	27.299166085222186
and you are not so any longer	43.9151439745208
no captivity has subdued mei have been here so long	109.59843772925329
so longwhen were you arrested then asked the inspector	72.37240393501955
the 28th of february 1815 at halfpast two in the afternoon	30.624062920118238
today is the 30th of july 1816why it is but seventeen months	42.32691103880726
only seventeen months replied dants	96.88617858521548
oh you do not know what is seventeen months in prisonseventeen ages rather espec	108.26653047671891
have pity on me then and ask for me not intelligence but a trial not pardon but 	166.30372487159877
we shall see said the inspector then turning to the governor on my word the poor	26.15316293260773
you must show me the proofs against him	123.50101449577132
certainly but you will find terrible charges	150.14599545529828
monsieur continued dants i know it is not in your power to release me but you ca	23.21980789483059
let me know my crime and the reason why i was condemned	83.37841265683676
uncertainty is worse than all	213.14705905541948
go on with the lights said the inspector	28.979089721794878
monsieur cried dants i can tell by your voice you are touched with pity tell me 	82.73780185470712
i can not tell you that replied the inspector i can only promise to examine into	34.49426029884297
oh i am freethen i am saved	33.929993362183595
who arrested you	831.048138230125
see him and hear what he says	64.00833257260398
villefort is no longer at marseilles he is now at toulouse	30.094621439323667
i am no longer surprised at my detention murmured dants since my only protector 	86.05622634914906
had m	1326.7389307804694
de villefort any cause of personal dislike to you	52.694390634804215
none on the contrary he was very kind to me	23.800182092240643
i can then rely on the notes he has left concerning you	137.1861873639981
that is well wait patiently then	409.18458206641304
dants fell on his knees and prayed earnestly	55.0179466795793
the door closed but this time a fresh inmate was left with dantshope	59.93755100318441
0173 m	1.0086647268304976
will you see the register at once asked the governor or proceed to the other cel	43.73334010006529
let us visit them all said the inspector	18.81596542632256
if i once went up those stairs	294.86558923663245
i should never have the courage to come down again	53.069402206537845
ah this one is not like the other and his madness is less affecting than this on	67.56360421910001
what is his folly	88.94931145556644
he fancies he possesses an immense treasure	205.80067670697528
the first year he offered government a million of francs for his release the sec	75.55804010027514
he is now in his fifth year of captivity he will ask to speak to you in private 	58.3246756674227
how curiouswhat is his name	45.98246753689686
the abb faria	17.970773403004113
27 said the inspector	31.832327419519928
it is here unlock the door antoine	65.3432173155341
the turnkey obeyed and the inspector gazed curiously into the chamber of the mad	106.81956980488334
in the centre of the cell in a circle traced with a fragment of plaster detached	57.06709039155671
he was drawing in this circle geometrical lines and seemed as much absorbed in h	78.59187345384585
he did not move at the sound of the door and continued his calculations until th	25.81595663467377
he hastily seized the coverlet of his bed and wrapped it round him	70.52912825092871
what is it you want said the inspector	13.237728779016898
i monsieur replied the abb with an air of surprisei want nothing	52.51377648210695
you do not understand continued the inspector i am sent here by government to vi	51.79907013822808
oh that is different cried the abb and we shall understand each other i hope	27.15664249281463
there now whispered the governor it is just as i told you	35.63220333029518
monsieur continued the prisoner i am the abb faria born at rome	47.26050617206336
i was for twenty years cardinal spadas secretary i was arrested why i know not t	62.08143902745815
why from the french government	75.66566288517618
because i was arrested at piombino and i presume that like milan and florence pi	28.791398112455518
ah said the inspector you have not the latest news from italy	34.3809627951058
my information dates from the day on which i was arrested returned the abb faria	70.42538600741294
monsieur returned the inspector providence has changed this gigantic plan you ad	196.86109129232247
it is the only means of rendering italy strong happy and independent	197.78742077773276
very possibly only i am not come to discuss politics but to inquire if you have 	68.5302580812986
the food is the same as in other prisonsthat is very bad the lodging is very unh	117.21093131890727
we are coming to the point whispered the governor	32.05586566364663
it is for that reason i am delighted to see you continued the abb although you h	27.321239254456188
could you allow me a few words in private	30.062558583792093
what did i tell you said the governor	11.598231533977597
you knew him returned the inspector with a smile	42.80458412757158
what you ask is impossible monsieur continued he addressing faria	171.40769087939435
0175 m	1.0053249595241804
but said the abb i would speak to you of a large sum amounting to five millions	44.36382745283133
the very sum you named whispered the inspector in his turn	119.69906171869133
however continued faria seeing that the inspector was about to depart it is not 	60.76501299805859
unfortunately said the governor i know beforehand what you are about to say it c	40.90287997853157
of course said he of what else should i speak	73.58231368051578
inspector continued the governor i can tell you the story as well as he for it h	36.40491067934016
that proves returned the abb that you are like those of holy writ who having eye	110.6439540585442
my dear sir the government is rich and does not want your treasures replied the 	60.99894281067194
the abbs eyes glistened he seized the inspectors hand	158.1375333144219
but what if i am not liberated cried he and am detained here until my death this	100.04154754016741
had not government better profit by it i will offer six millions and i will cont	126.55449043142072
on my word said the inspector in a low tone had i not been told beforehand that 	24.454874385442192
i am not mad replied faria with that acuteness of hearing peculiar to prisoners	60.915172910776015
the treasure i speak of really exists and i offer to sign an agreement with you 	158.98615749840872
the governor laughed	853.7973499972368
is the spot far from here	287.6586791083544
a hundred leagues	59.882216227110625
it is not illplanned said the governor	15.032841853483662
if all the prisoners took it into their heads to travel a hundred leagues and th	40.61296121400916
the scheme is well known said the inspector and the abbs plan has not even the m	85.28899225182103
then turning to faria i inquired if you are well fed said he	35.76514855165768
swear to me replied faria to free me if what i tell you prove true and i will st	60.32316464054007
are you well fed repeated the inspector	48.63870823524605
monsieur you run no risk for as i told you i will stay here so there is no chanc	47.147996283385616
you do not reply to my question replied the inspector impatiently	41.92575861289871
nor you to mine cried the abb	90.01597237312906
you will not accept my gold i will keep it for myself	58.532183031881964
you refuse me my liberty god will give it me	104.15336607692683
and the abb casting away his coverlet resumed his place and continued his calcul	83.48451449560146
0177 m	1.0173548456923738
what is he doing there said the inspector	18.341637105263207
counting his treasures replied the governor	121.68427111403444
faria replied to this sarcasm with a glance of profound contempt	51.711164405404325
they went out	31.77600310973191
the turnkey closed the door behind them	80.40595967893077
he was wealthy once perhaps said the inspector	194.09139250593893
or dreamed he was and awoke mad	496.5504024015664
after all said the inspector if he had been rich he would not have been here	31.55360396728197
so the matter ended for the abb faria	59.37964395267737
he remained in his cell and this visit only increased the belief in his insanity	112.8366481431202

as the inquisition rarely allowed its victims to be seen with their limbs distor	87.44876888839747
the very madness of the abb faria gone mad in prison condemned him to perpetual 	136.2219012548391
the inspector kept his word with dants he examined the register and found the fo	47.42456750006145
edmond dants	17.18910841204347
violent bonapartist took an active part in the return from elba	68.9395555379751
the greatest watchfulness and care to be exercised	419.82474919704333
this note was in a different hand from the rest which showed that it had been ad	60.01957581256592
the inspector could not contend against this accusation he simply wrote nothing 	257.0891060462346
this visit had infused new vigor into dants he had till then forgotten the date 	391.67849654556636
days and weeks passed away then monthsdants still waited he at first expected to	155.55924163576677

finally ten months and a half had gone by and no favorable change had taken plac	105.54493349587665
at the expiration of a year the governor was transferred he had obtained charge 	58.62013864779684
he took with him several of his subordinates and amongst them dants jailer	125.95276836397275

dants passed through all the stages of torture natural to prisoners in suspense	293.54855956875156
he was sustained at first by that pride of conscious innocence which is the sequ	92.933500911071

his requests were not granted but he went on asking all the same	88.86931159884053
he accustomed himself to speaking to the new jailer although the latter was if p	147.41339241827936
dants spoke for the sake of hearing his own voice he had tried to speak when alo	53.531417086695114
often before his captivity dants mind had revolted at the idea of assemblages of	100.00539480048917
he now wished to be amongst them in order to see some other face besides that of	126.88344019747312
the galleyslaves breathed the fresh air of heaven and saw each other	91.83660341642353
they were very happy	51.31804282184861
he besought the jailer one day to let him have a companion were it even the mad 	235.78135886318103
the jailer though rough and hardened by the constant sight of so much suffering 	139.17616028129504
at the bottom of his heart he had often had a feeling of pity for this unhappy y	43.071488213300874
dants had exhausted all human resources and he then turned to god	169.65907289021115

yet in spite of his earnest prayers dants remained a prisoner	56.111398944414375
then gloom settled heavily upon him	1365.0078554267552
dants was a man of great simplicity of thought and without education he could no	74.95295693050085
he could not do this he whose past life was so short whose present so melancholy	259.3682837657734

he clung to one ideathat of his happiness destroyed without apparent cause by an	312.4896063532863
rage supplanted religious fervor	975.3717680477499
dants uttered blasphemies that made his jailer recoil with horror dashed himself	224.83174995763193

this state of mental anguish is however less terrible than the sufferings that p	138.0284352954592
there is a sort of consolation at the contemplation of the yawning abyss at the 	26.030104674758658
edmond found some solace in these ideas	210.8350609435465
all his sorrows all his sufferings with their train of gloomy spectres fled from	324.6401142272942
dants reviewed his past life with composure and looking forward with terror to h	218.56960261800168

no sooner had this idea taken possession of him than he became more composed arr	156.69619880722726
two methods of selfdestruction were at his disposal	56.451100547581355
he could hang himself with his handkerchief to the window bars or refuse food an	155.47388799348983
but the first was repugnant to him	48.53193025907782
dants had always entertained the greatest horror of pirates who are hung up to t	102.69372969414457
he resolved to adopt the second and began that day to carry out his resolve	121.451876771603

nearly four years had passed away at the end of the second he had ceased to mark	29.463978779912107

he persisted until at last he had not sufficient strength to rise and cast his s	120.78205836567773
the next morning he could not see or hear the jailer feared he was dangerously i	81.19323974162695
edmond hoped he was dying	276.72308446761565
thus the day passed away	44.29228839439411
edmond felt a sort of stupor creeping over him which brought with it a feeling a	61.70773845550283
it was the twilight of that mysterious country called death	158.77864805734364
suddenly about nine oclock in the evening edmond heard a hollow sound in the wal	31.909750003514144
so many loathsome animals inhabited the prison that their noise did not in gener	168.53322183914997
it was a continual scratching as if made by a huge claw a powerful tooth or some	87.20837261736153
although weakened the young mans brain instantly responded to the idea that haun	95.34699096321752
perhaps one of those beloved ones he had so often thought of was thinking of him	81.42047132527505
no no doubtless he was deceived and it was but one of those dreams that forerun 	58.91895261790377
edmond still heard the sound	116.32896036553008
it lasted nearly three hours he then heard a noise of something falling and all 	169.5301676836631
some hours afterwards it began again nearer and more distinct	214.99802322235178
edmond was intensely interested	270.4717756160473
suddenly the jailer entered	35.07521931695807
for a week since he had resolved to die and during the four days that he had bee	25.92652116491779
the jailer brought him his breakfast	125.91319572713712
dants raised himself up and began to talk about everything about the bad quality	122.37192955433306
fortunately he fancied that dants was delirious and placing the food on the rick	33.77739668002039
edmond listened and the sound became more and more distinct	76.49868856292791
there can be no doubt about it thought he it is some prisoner who is striving to	62.37591278390178
oh if i were only there to help him	46.40704221350068
suddenly another idea took possession of his mind so used to misfortune that it 	196.2577720915923
it was easy to ascertain this but how could he risk the question it was easy to 	50.200951626971694
he saw but one means of restoring lucidity and clearness to his judgment	106.6945962174361
he turned his eyes towards the soup which the jailer had brought rose staggered 	84.4530980168792
he had the resolution to stop with this	65.98650582841923
he had often heard that shipwrecked persons had died through having eagerly devo	156.56825815606274
edmond replaced on the table the bread he was about to devour and returned to hi	109.41406078624543
he soon felt that his ideas became again collectedhe could think and strengthen 	241.07104588467882
then he said to himself	18.363685828963145
i must put this to the test but without compromising anybody	165.08375346830675
if it is a workman i need but knock against the wall and he will cease to work i	78.8243775751457
if on the contrary it is a prisoner the noise i make will alarm him he will ceas	64.94344085009853
edmond rose again but this time his legs did not tremble and his sight was clear	84.43481724533055
he struck thrice	2616.675507238924
at the first blow the sound ceased as if by magic	26.636656017162334
edmond listened intently an hour passed two hours passed and no sound was heard 	117.20243626660363
full of hope edmond swallowed a few mouthfuls of bread and water and thanks to t	47.797468835361805
the day passed away in utter silencenight came without recurrence of the noise	104.40999863909953
it is a prisoner said edmond joyfully	25.693351737896016
his brain was on fire and life and energy returned	170.2042404343025
the night passed in perfect silence	213.49687350742198
edmond did not close his eyes	59.978606586082066
in the morning the jailer brought him fresh provisionshe had already devoured th	67.25679325061195
at intervals he listened to learn if the noise had not begun again and grew impa	83.28106261545261
three days passedseventytwo long tedious hours which he counted off by minutes	342.3761010323795
at length one evening as the jailer was visiting him for the last time that nigh	40.04629093746721
he moved away walked up and down his cell to collect his thoughts and then went 	64.17709466525203
the matter was no longer doubtful	63.28249540485533
something was at work on the other side of the wall the prisoner had discovered 	32.10068326813896
encouraged by this discovery edmond determined to assist the indefatigable labor	78.54013678947807
he began by moving his bed and looked around for anything with which he could pi	62.67671442407959
he saw nothing he had no knife or sharp instrument the window grating was of iro	135.6548526112236
all his furniture consisted of a bed a chair a table a pail and a jug	126.64051253791303
the bed had iron clamps but they were screwed to the wood and it would have requ	64.86783142781718

0189 m	1.0082335468615544
dants had but one resource which was to break the jug and with one of the sharp 	65.54534012605767
he let the jug fall on the floor and it broke in pieces	76.48165550562334
dants concealed two or three of the sharpest fragments in his bed leaving the re	72.4761458118696
the breaking of his jug was too natural an accident to excite suspicion	130.86371983022795
edmond had all the night to work in but in the darkness he could not do much and	55.763503406121394
all night he heard the subterranean workman who continued to mine his way	145.93989050067142
day came the jailer entered	95.94774043642381
dants told him that the jug had fallen from his hands while he was drinking and 	52.179514720149925
he returned speedily advised the prisoner to be more careful and departed	206.55759436562855
dants heard joyfully the key grate in the lock he listened until the sound of st	72.57038116782091
the damp had rendered it friable and dants was able to break it offin small mors	75.46985686948244
the prisoner reproached himself with not having thus employed the hours he had p	162.34769104027106
during the six years that he had been imprisoned what might he not have accompli	35.12552284633024
this idea imparted new energy and in three days he had succeeded with the utmost	114.42419026045079
the wall was built of rough stones among which to give strength to the structure	88.93743623400904
it was one of these he had uncovered and which he must remove from its socket	91.70982816891033
dants strove to do this with his nails but they were too weak	100.19407646867796
the fragments of the jug broke and after an hour of useless toil dants paused wi	64.64146926699952
was he to be thus stopped at the beginning and was he to wait inactive until his	96.83107893531178
the jailer always brought dants soup in an iron saucepan this saucepan contained	323.5098756416215
the handle of this saucepan was of iron dants would have given ten years of his 	99.46357798944591
0191 m	1.0173460246402923
the jailer was accustomed to pour the contents of the saucepan into dants plate 	64.07514857624429
now when evening came dants put his plate on the ground near the door the jailer	40.85997416496842
this time he could not blame dants	44.61490725522451
he was wrong to leave it there but the jailer was wrong not to have looked befor	48.66082754413912
the jailer therefore only grumbled	331.30931498781365
then he looked about for something to pour the soup into dants entire dinner ser	127.9718675915249
leave the saucepan said dants you can take it away when you bring me my breakfas	29.735109948015864
this advice was to the jailers taste as it spared him the necessity of making an	168.24632965241167
he left the saucepan	132.6525073808618
dants was beside himself with joy	93.80702423700691
he rapidly devoured his food and after waiting an hour lest the jailer should ch	105.33683237930691
a slight oscillation showed dants that all went well	335.32643310497133
at the end of an hour the stone was extricated from the wall leaving a cavity a 	19.6399407976146
dants carefully collected the plaster carried it into the corner of his cell and	79.90549253681884
then wishing to make the best use of his time while he had the means of labor he	74.10477745916978
at the dawn of day he replaced the stone pushed his bed against the wall and lay	45.487742496494654
the breakfast consisted of a piece of bread the jailer entered and placed the br	41.67842330653341
well do nt you intend to bring me another plate said dants	36.37059901291039
no replied the turnkey you destroy everything	133.1503599169733
first you break your jug then you make me break your plate if all the prisoners 	175.86276743701004
i shall leave you the saucepan and pour your soup into that	92.50667531620068
so for the future i hope you will not be so destructive	17.66434876385534
dants raised his eyes to heaven and clasped his hands beneath the coverlet	20.084354133016998
he felt more gratitude for the possession of this piece of iron than he had ever	102.33249164181575
he had noticed however that the prisoner on the other side had ceased to labor n	49.08896770880261
all day he toiled on untiringly and by the evening he had succeeded in extractin	45.14013563732498
when the hour for his jailers visit arrived dants straightened the handle of the	93.43128068171313
the turnkey poured his ration of soup into it together with the fishfor thrice a	189.6411116595613
this would have been a method of reckoning time had not dants long ceased to do 	101.1527736819839
having poured out the soup the turnkey retired	313.161752181765
dants wished to ascertain whether his neighbor had really ceased to work	91.34549030004501
he listenedall was silent as it had been for the last three days	54.1234829860762
dants sighed it was evident that his neighbor distrusted him	41.429356556644606
however he toiled on all the night without being discouraged but after two or th	75.12585343272315

edmonds hair stood on end and he rose to his knees	75.0255092023548
ah said he i hear a human voice	46.18883771923398

who are you	9.141498709664452
who are you said the voice	22.28054751987509
an unhappy prisoner replied dants who made no hesitation in answering	82.26184085142317
of what country	124.67517151678065

your crime	1246.8682820009785
i am innocent	100.39962939140773
but of what are you accused	71.66002629127496
of having conspired to aid the emperors return	113.07142677242996

he abdicated at fontainebleau in 1814 and was sent to the island of elba	38.79241822996493
but how long have you been here that you are ignorant of all this	32.29134236901434
since 1811	40798.466137426985
dants shuddered this man had been four years longer than himself in prison	115.42004874319414
do not dig any more said the voice only tell me how high up is your excavation	168.91449225650734
on a level with the floor	71.87099528894448
how is it concealed	74.34704693602816
behind my bed	94.13655105155522
has your bed been moved since you have been a prisoner	115.86609922771963
what does your chamber open on	320.21920453536165
a corridor	2441.009796600355
and the corridor	146.77350964510686
on a court	182.7951116617189
alas murmured the voice	44.42273900960057
oh what is the matter cried dants	9.822368126491472
i have made a mistake owing to an error in my plans	89.52733782830316
i took the wrong angle and have come out fifteen feet from where i intended	223.09879671524456
i took the wall you are mining for the outer wall of the fortress	61.528010771584924
but then you would be close to the sea	45.137305255103406
that is what i hoped	22.584908410123056
and supposing you had succeeded	112.68974938925727
i should have thrown myself into the sea gained one of the islands near herethe 	71.87898081989286
could you have swum so far	40.299310596915696
heaven would have given me strength but now all is lost	68.82613866723325
yes stop up your excavation carefully do not work any more and wait until you he	274.49512212442556
tell me at least who you are	27.376206575986807
i ami am no	204.5799988047745
you mistrust me then said dants	26.471089898014107
edmond fancied he heard a bitter laugh resounding from the depths	60.084835251528375
oh i am a christian cried dants guessing instinctively that this man meant to ab	33.70776041706663

how old are you your voice is that of a young man	81.75079677253234
i do not know my age for i have not counted the years i have been here	34.95894675603406
all i do know is that i was just nineteen when i was arrested the 28th of februa	39.62632482449481
not quite twentysix murmured the voice at that age he can not be a traitor	80.60373302096694
oh no no cried dants	8.570835843384234
i swear to you again rather than betray you i would allow myself to be hacked in	70.99479899656072

i must calculate our chances i will give you the signal	101.67959550057655
but you will not leave me you will come to me or you will let me come to you	23.50030538777827
we will escape and if we can not escape we will talk you of those whom you love 	60.33110411706085
you must love somebody	521.046282094212
no i am alone in the world	18.049063944191428
then you will love me	25.864343322579685
if you are young i will be your comrade if you are old i will be your son	39.61528205818052
i have a father who is seventy if he yet lives i only love him and a young girl 	94.46408230162395
my father has not yet forgotten me i am sure but god alone knows if she loves me	47.464825827854476
it is well returned the voice tomorrow	90.14887402585845
these few words were uttered with an accent that left no doubt of his sincerity 	57.608763364599135
he then gave himself up to his happiness	61.232984837979416
he would no longer be alone	58.57138224097654
he was perhaps about to regain his liberty at the worst he would have a companio	66.40980095066337
plaints made in common are almost prayers and prayers where two or three are gat	168.2634186798959
all day dants walked up and down his cell	53.10128400987642
he sat down occasionally on his bed pressing his hand on his heart	33.82196808356263
at the slightest noise he bounded towards the door	96.7705654990926
once or twice the thought crossed his mind that he might be separated from this 	122.55441386676355
he would be condemned to die but he was about to die of grief and despair when t	30.941442957004025
the jailer came in the evening	78.54699059508995
dants was on his bed	30.047732740192366
it seemed to him that thus he better guarded the unfinished opening	138.29320779256219
doubtless there was a strange expression in his eyes for the jailer said come ar	97.03431308726037
dants did not answer he feared that the emotion of his voice would betray him	29.324859744294752
the jailer went away shaking his head	66.71777446902784
night came dants hoped that his neighbor would profit by the silence to address 	148.29325426418646
the next morning however just as he removed his bed from the wall he heard three	67.79011304025003
is it you said he i am here	20.758655161181043
is your jailer gone	1773.6966183526
yes said dants he will not return until the evening so that we have twelve hours	39.34099868224725
i can work then said the voice	99.52710426567381
oh yes yes this instant i entreat you	53.269755877228796
in a moment that part of the floor on which dants was resting his two hands as h	49.373640324198824

advancing to the opening he stooped and raised the stone easily in spite of its 	56.50207929278431
you removed this stone very carelessly but i suppose you had no tools to aid you	148.63093311703184
why exclaimed dants with astonishment do you possess any	45.61903830990048
i made myself some and with the exception of a file i have all that are necessar	49.83561014469425
0201 m	1.0614086380135284
oh how i should like to see these products of your industry and patience	80.50866286545681
well in the first place here is my chisel	39.405311002921394
so saying he displayed a sharp strong blade with a handle made of beechwood	115.80738414470416
and with what did you contrive to make that inquired dants	36.828674884401856
with one of the clamps of my bedstead and this very tool has sufficed me to holl	32.613449350409304
fifty feet responded dants almost terrified	386.094019462921
do not speak so loud young mandont speak so loud	158.4524396568413
it frequently occurs in a state prison like this that persons are stationed outs	479.0029118844533
but they believe i am shut up alone here	149.47949602543886
that makes no difference	144.25573441791028
and you say that you dug your way a distance of fifty feet to get here	89.79775942396067
i do that is about the distance that separates your chamber from mine only unfor	198.3021863342579

my labor is all in vain for i find that the corridor looks into a courtyard fill	146.4599530743288

the young man obeyed mounted on the table and divining the wishes of his compani	34.50060986716441
the stranger whom as yet dants knew only by the number of his cell sprang up wit	109.06630971200191
an instant afterwards he hastily drew back his head saying i thought so and slid	66.24199002721573
what was it that you thought asked the young man anxiously in his turn descendin	19.211456650108047
the elder prisoner pondered the matter	391.53713954567235
yes said he at length it is so	18.259500086701802
this side of your chamber looks out upon a kind of open gallery where patrols ar	155.32642787086607
are you quite sure of that	11.252388161176553
i saw the soldiers shape and the top of his musket that made me draw in my head 	82.58856959297708
well inquired dants	38.615734407728645
you perceive then the utter impossibility of escaping through your dungeon	157.60711522816564
then pursued the young man eagerly	57.428732183187996
then answered the elder prisoner the will of god be done and as the old man slow	115.08437445215066
dants gazed on the man who could thus philosophically resign hopes so long and a	140.02314731226
tell me i entreat of you who and what you are said he at length	36.356762048916586
never have i met with so remarkable a person as yourself	112.81362207840968
willingly answered the stranger if indeed you feel any curiosity respecting one 	232.24359703007693
say not so you can console and support me by the strength of your own powerful m	115.8232889607951
pray let me know who you really are	86.85487684771867
the stranger smiled a melancholy smile	188.7244958356484
then listen said he	39.96317795124634
i am the abb faria and have been imprisoned as you know in this chteau dif since	35.348058993526976
in the year 1811 i was transferred to piedmont in france	33.85350411453156
it was at this period i learned that the destiny which seemed subservient to eve	61.39885025361112
i was very far then from expecting the change you have just informed me of namel	98.67547669368427

how inscrutable are the ways of providencefor what great and mysterious purpose 	219.25970212836052
dants whole attention was riveted on a man who could thus forget his own misfort	86.53573593207125

probably if ever i get out of prison	66.51736461353902
true replied faria we are prisoners but i forget this sometimes and there are ev	46.24837539144052
but wherefore are you here	150.78799786788264
because in 1807 i dreamed of the very plan napoleon tried to realize in 1811 bec	134.4379856814061
it was the plan of alexander vi	7.664320005898661
and clement vii	20.322652580229914
but it will never succeed now for they attempted it fruitlessly and napoleon was	135.3755707386849
italy seems fated to misfortune	556.3790222087018
and the old man bowed his head	13.0013720408161
dants could not understand a man risking his life for such matters	55.631904935539524
napoleon certainly he knew something of inasmuch as he had seen and spoken with 	108.42849746482659
and alexander vi	20.834482180953962
he knew nothing	152.86312650184198
are you not he asked the priest who here in the chteau dif is generally thought 	34.778141010504456
mad you mean do nt you	61.58445523902224
i did not like to say so answered dants smiling	31.257379646095583
well then resumed faria with a bitter smile let me answer your question in full 	33.1847111394639
dants remained for a short time mute and motionless at length he said	47.92216456104459
then you abandon all hope of escape	165.0743862839968
i perceive its utter impossibility and i consider it impious to attempt that whi	99.88586907463592
nay be not discouraged	179.41636865181053
would it not be expecting too much to hope to succeed at your first attempt why 	134.49787311158778
alas it shows how little notion you can have of all it has cost me to effect a p	84.01585053648978

no i repeat again that nothing shall induce me to renew attempts evidently at va	256.19453578551867
dants held down his head that the other might not see how joy at the thought of 	62.64916504782744
the abb sank upon edmonds bed while edmond himself remained standing	173.94979907447973
escape had never once occurred to him	72.27939068745128
there are indeed some things which appear so impossible that the mind does not d	91.53498497212645
to undermine the ground for fifty feetto devote three years to a labor which if 	200.13882093999393

another had done all this why then was it impossible to dants faria had dug his 	95.35794865498173
after continuing some time in profound meditation the young man suddenly exclaim	136.06239864169473
faria started have you indeed cried he raising his head with quick anxiety pray 	229.80871208800647

about that	49.68743985790307
well then i will tell you what we must do	15.682524851948543
we must pierce through the corridor by forming a side opening about the middle a	173.7922735606369
this time you will lay your plans more accurately we shall get out into the gall	80.23843288107852
all we require to insure success is courage and that you possess and strength wh	236.9140981553824
one instant my dear friend replied the abb it is clear you do not understand the	24.074163963049934

no neither do i wish to incur guilt	148.8508720889949
hitherto i have fancied myself merely waging war against circumstances not men	810.1198328362393
i have thought it no sin to bore through a wall or destroy a staircase but i can	153.13809901421646
a slight movement of surprise escaped dants	54.57066459913282
is it possible said he that where your liberty is at stake you can allow any suc	59.64872914799331
tell me replied faria what has hindered you from knocking down your jailer with 	110.17308104399636
simply the fact that the idea never occurred to me answered dants	51.76695810833745
because said the old man the natural repugnance to the commission of such a crim	36.02454892535689

dants was confused and silent at this explanation of the thoughts which had unco	64.53401564349046

since my imprisonment said faria i have thought over all the most celebrated cas	45.327636404150084
they have rarely been successful	105.04876462634319
those that have been crowned with full success have been long meditated upon and	165.82892237843157

let us therefore wait patiently for some favorable moment and when it presents i	171.89600753059986
ah said dants you might well endure the tedious delay you were constantly employ	103.8132758199456
i assure you replied the old man i did not turn to that source for recreation or	49.27248484390087
what did you do then	13.036390706869188
i wrote or studied	1013.5493190925537
were you then permitted the use of pens ink and paper	84.37798691770682
oh no answered the abb i had none but what i made for myself	43.497673865599126
you made paper pens and ink	548.178545871207
dants gazed with admiration but he had some difficulty in believing	70.9947312906766
faria saw this	91.49972476122255
when you pay me a visit in my cell my young friend said he i will show you an en	33.63810731846725

the work i speak of is called a treatise on the possibility of a general monarch	95.4693247288667
and on what have you written all this	88.04697371915778
on two of my shirts	40.53566861001339
i invented a preparation that makes linen as smooth and as easy to write on as p	241.31762820851023

why i made a vocabulary of the words i knew turned returned and arranged them so	196.0160090730031

while retracing the past i forget the present and traversing at will the path of	229.21434581550628
but the ink said dants of what did you make your ink	80.97343760135938
there was formerly a fireplace in my dungeon replied faria but it was closed up 	64.65925684713135
still it must have been many years in use for it was thickly covered with a coat	73.61070436228799
for very important notes for which closer attention is required i pricked one of	518.8429411591211
and when asked dants may i see all this	52.4220831218817
whenever you please replied the abb	29.67746524727673
oh then let it be directly exclaimed the young man	35.58392284710619
follow me then said the abb as he reentered the subterranean passage in which he	20.503264276032084
chapter 17	1799.7890588100302
the abbs chamber	816.8015588921124
after having passed with tolerable ease through the subterranean passage which h	96.91103679799747
the floor of the abbs cell was paved and it had been by raising one of the stone	47.83093863069088
as he entered the chamber of his friend dants cast around one eager and searchin	51.01723296606691
it is well said the abb we have some hours before usit is now just a quarter pas	42.77127643568397
instinctively dants turned round to observe by what watch or clock the abb had b	169.00158352834538

well by means of these lines which are in accordance with the double motion of t	74.21730167421411
this last explanation was wholly lost upon dants who had always imagined from se	144.63124628632448
a double movement of the globe he inhabited and of which he could feel nothing a	65.28239392259194
each word that fell from his companions lips seemed fraught with the mysteries o	109.08654226051866
come said he to the abb i am anxious to see your treasures	19.81670556080191
the abb smiled and proceeding to the disused fireplace raised by the help of his	53.25633314064414
0213 m	1.008292555700524
what do you wish to see first asked the abb	16.016541564688296
oh your great work on the monarchy of italy	87.00679785191839
faria then drew forth from his hidingplace three or four rolls of linen laid one	116.56233443293269
these rolls consisted of slips of cloth about four inches wide and eighteen long	155.78453007032167
there said he there is the work complete	85.56460279922004
i wrote the word finis at the end of the sixtyeighth strip about a week ago	62.45513932926132
i have torn up two of my shirts and as many handkerchiefs as i was master of to 	49.049296426564105
should i ever get out of prison and find in all italy a printer courageous enoug	87.81012485241742
i see answered dants	75.29713808375932
now let me behold the curious pens with which you have written your work	83.25267372892155
look said faria showing to the young man a slender stick about six inches long a	75.15914018465803
dants examined it with intense admiration then looked around to see the instrume	50.15925754508793
ah yes said faria the penknife	19.031726217933883
that s my masterpiece	95.65191105518039
i made it as well as this larger knife out of an old iron candlestick	50.75948579382251
the penknife was sharp and keen as a razor as for the other knife it would serve	95.91526240652485
dants examined the various articles shown to him with the same attention that he	76.20059378116026
as for the ink said faria i told you how i managed to obtain thatand i only just	74.5204645834535
one thing still puzzles me observed dants and that is how you managed to do all 	76.39050016351773
i worked at night also replied faria	159.5214448727453
nightwhy for heavens sake are your eyes like cats that you can see to work in th	76.32805540314735
indeed they are not but god has supplied man with the intelligence that enables 	135.10137326231762
i furnished myself with a light	165.66674313454237
you did pray tell me how	157.7134173026236
i separated the fat from the meat served to me melted it and so made oilhere is 	239.41524759389875
so saying the abb exhibited a sort of torch very similar to those used in public	102.10184958719633
but how do you procure a light	70.87218802227325
oh here are two flints and a piece of burnt linen	61.013749667820754
and matches	19553.898296660565
i pretended that i had a disorder of the skin and asked for a little sulphur whi	52.429307694039046
dants laid the different things he had been looking at on the table and stood wi	113.5555534962867

you have not seen all yet continued faria for i did not think it wise to trust a	47.647984994045935
let us shut this one up	129.0103772795583
they put the stone back in its place the abb sprinkled a little dust over it to 	84.12958299894169
behind the head of the bed and concealed by a stone fitting in so closely as to 	61.430800046820075
dants closely and eagerly examined it he found it firm solid and compact enough 	226.62170883487838
who supplied you with the materials for making this wonderful work	149.0454068179849
i tore up several of my shirts and ripped out the seams in the sheets of my bed 	44.507284231129205
and was it not discovered that your sheets were unhemmed	88.81474782345796
oh no for when i had taken out the thread i required i hemmed the edges over aga	75.47251994204058

nevertheless i carefully preserved my ladder against one of those unforeseen opp	145.47861591296987
while affecting to be deeply engaged in examining the ladder the mind of dants w	134.39311965071656
what are you thinking of asked the abb smilingly imputing the deep abstraction i	47.595439145891106
i was reflecting in the first place replied dants upon the enormous degree of in	41.11871322158349
what would you not have accomplished if you had been free	55.896799149424396
possibly nothing at all the overflow of my brain would probably in a state of fr	45.04790068084282
compression is needed to explode gunpowder	644.6635432531133
captivity has brought my mental faculties to a focus and you are well aware that	66.6381927443099
no replied dants	5.105621184969382
i know nothing	26.69943007154749
some of your words are to me quite empty of meaning	203.76133195331522
you must be blessed indeed to possess the knowledge you have	83.85759510068472
the abb smiled	30.747184101908218
well said he but you had another subject for your thoughts did you not say so ju	53.30042370750721
i did	96.54113406336805
you have told me as yet but one of themlet me hear the other	78.90850319427699
it was thisthat while you had related to me all the particulars of your past lif	60.97849838405029
your life my young friend has not been of sufficient length to admit of your hav	100.38186960672498
it has been long enough to inflict on me a great and undeserved misfortune	64.38279379321082
i would fain fix the source of it on man that i may no longer vent reproaches up	228.58968655111445
then you profess ignorance of the crime with which you are charged	98.47007295084437
i do indeed and this i swear by the two beings most dear to me upon earthmy fath	152.90358625978806
come said the abb closing his hidingplace and pushing the bed back to its origin	64.95087346237484
dants obeyed and commenced what he called his history but which consisted only o	209.56873273614627
from this point everything was a blank to dantshe knew nothing more not even the	136.6984030433606
his recital finished the abb reflected long and earnestly	387.8739767883347
there is said he at the end of his meditations a clever maxim which bears upon w	49.89950351382986
still from an artificial civilization have originated wants vices and false tast	551.8315917353417
from this view of things then comes the axiom that if you visit to discover the 	210.90283174347525

to no one by heaven i was a very insignificant person	66.64906087419187
do not speak thus for your reply evinces neither logic nor philosophy everything	443.0889340667763
now in the event of the kings death his successor inherits a crownwhen the emplo	64.7758757745677
well these twelve thousand livres are his civil list and are as essential to him	122.68842812464625

but these forces increase as we go higher so that we have a spiral which in defi	223.57387101109268
now let us return to your particular world	67.42026269753752
you say you were on the point of being made captain of the pharaon	40.67027588024816
and about to become the husband of a young and lovely girl	95.46445385772708
now could anyone have had any interest in preventing the accomplishment of these	145.00310300294595
what say you	57.09036114630241
i can not believe such was the case	44.94358339730519
i was generally liked on board and had the sailors possessed the right of select	294.00901769508
there was only one person among the crew who had any feeling of illwill towards 	88.047561498082
i had quarelled with him some time previously and had even challenged him to fig	130.6651868009676
now we are getting on	42.694680546048794
and what was this mans name	49.294316489137124
what rank did he hold on board	235.09194034125738
he was supercargo	209.94600848375094
and had you been captain should you have retained him in his employment	134.3848531162746
not if the choice had remained with me for i had frequently observed inaccuracie	84.04802638533607
good again now then tell me was any person present during your last conversation	361.85857958778126
no we were quite alone	130.58253287019946
could your conversation have been overheard by anyone	172.84656757039036
it might for the cabin door was openandstay now i recollectdanglars himself pass	409.71700516061526
that s better cried the abb now we are on the right scent	49.706883618148346
did you take anybody with you when you put into the port of elba	42.381228157724806
somebody there received your packet and gave you a letter in place of it i think	115.47669526781911
yes the grand marshal did	395.1781747787436
and what did you do with that letter	24.23698569122659
put it into my portfolio	23.12486578964341
you had your portfolio with you then now how could a sailor find room in his poc	171.02266850278352
you are right it was left on board	56.71976017344723
then it was not till your return to the ship that you put the letter in the port	49.100813304389305
and what did you do with this same letter while returning from portoferrajo to t	41.318412809552434
i carried it in my hand	69.91372633822003
so that when you went on board the pharaon everybody could see that you held a l	84.16709992568995
danglars as well as the rest	31.096229757809045
danglars as well as others	99.11195375504748
now listen to me and try to recall every circumstance attending your arrest	121.41626564124299
do you recollect the words in which the information against you was formulated	68.47329173429358
oh yes i read it over three times and the words sank deeply into my memory	104.21312924311516
repeat it to me	13.922713299520897
dants paused a moment then said this is it word for word the kings attorney is i	112.94274707042948
this proof of his guilt may be procured by his immediate arrest as the letter wi	106.68152189991225
the abb shrugged his shoulders	24.462705995870383
the thing is clear as day said he and you must have had a very confiding nature 	85.44025208085242
do you really think so ah that would indeed be infamous	88.75031424577564
how did danglars usually write	223.62366264454465
in a handsome running hand	913.8017111427259
and how was the anonymous letter written	151.7663557539947
again the abb smiled	35.4307125793371
it was very boldly written if disguised	525.1857363992516
stop a bit said the abb taking up what he called his pen and after dipping it in	78.29170703835284
dants drew back and gazed on the abb with a sensation almost amounting to terror	95.8928544034785
how very astonishing cried he at length	102.85000803097915
why your writing exactly resembles that of the accusation	230.9357713022895
simply because that accusation had been written with the left hand and i have no	82.04540517836499
that while the writing of different persons done with the right hand varies that	299.45635175548017
you have evidently seen and observed everything	388.4899881058142
let us proceed	18.64307721224229
oh yes yes	11.041889815493779
now as regards the second question	151.67223439485554
i am listening	38.68221797555328
was there any person whose interest it was to prevent your marriage with mercds	96.63435266526001
yes a young man who loved her	53.37697965791213
and his name was	26.81871411544287
that is a spanish name i think	25.72166839889808
he was a catalan	13.244370922338323
you imagine him capable of writing the letter	155.02926579466205
oh no he would more likely have got rid of me by sticking a knife into me	69.7436457946592
that is in strict accordance with the spanish character an assassination they wi	88.25714450638634
besides said dants the various circumstances mentioned in the letter were wholly	134.20631763726004
you had never spoken of them yourself to anyone	113.28573265285989
to no one	133.14686795560564
not even to your mistress	249.48616372494854
no not even to my betrothed	277.082094227027
then it is danglars	20.450952355800112
i feel quite sure of it now	63.06981495330577
wait a little	69.315823269798
pray was danglars acquainted with fernand	115.97189458479338
noyes he was	52.42290802267757
now i recollect	55.46484820956751
to have seen them both sitting at table together under an arbor at pre pamphiles	146.58473606172416
they were in earnest conversation	85.28809753937878
danglars was joking in a friendly way but fernand looked pale and agitated	77.90325967287312
were they alone	183.15501494616547
there was a third person with them whom i knew perfectly well and who had in all	71.38034399314287
staystayhow strange that it should not have occurred to me before now i remember	107.09441440999389
oh the heartless treacherous scoundrels exclaimed dants pressing his hand to his	37.65179153456003
is there anything else i can assist you in discovering besides the villany of yo	59.16944253850192
yes yes replied dants eagerly i would beg of you who see so completely to the de	61.776512483414905
that is altogether a different and more serious matter responded the abb	99.60406378204034
the ways of justice are frequently too dark and mysterious to be easily penetrat	97.79009331083142
all we have hitherto done in the matter has been childs play	156.8506434358674
if you wish me to enter upon the more difficult part of the business you must as	65.48395388798326
pray ask me whatever questions you please for in good truth you see more clearly	219.04965494525783
in the first place then who examined youthe kings attorney his deputy or a magis	104.76208411252755
the deputy	1058.2699749733379
was he young or old	146.74453786068855
about six or sevenandtwenty years of age i should say	25.22679451254514
so answered the abb	19.644895535828663
old enough to be ambitious but too young to be corrupt	128.4072644540181
and how did he treat you	41.605034353363216
with more of mildness than severity	189.51600069372483
did you tell him your whole story	79.72821080319451
i did	100.24669193979042
and did his conduct change at all in the course of your examination	118.6429728603392
he did appear much disturbed when he read the letter that had brought me into th	86.74200981585192
he seemed quite overcome by my misfortune	322.6714726731554
by your misfortune	181.371550997733
then you feel quite sure that it was your misfortune he deplored	74.78744765102599
he gave me one great proof of his sympathy at any rate	64.25808808235665
and that	88.09829320150494
he burnt the sole evidence that could at all have criminated me	202.41487416599142
what the accusation	322.30502836282596
no the letter	268.96650341102213
are you sure	4.414348163451251
i saw it done	153.33151011357003
that alters the case	217.37795644351718
this man might after all be a greater scoundrel than you have thought possible	182.7778541030947
upon my word said dants you make me shudder	13.030300219235787
is the world filled with tigers and crocodiles	200.03148690184932
yes and remember that twolegged tigers and crocodiles are more dangerous than th	83.60486269191588
never mind let us go on	34.041447650332366
with all my heart you tell me he burned the letter	60.97157849501362
he did saying at the same time you see i thus destroy the only proof existing ag	105.47671113046297
this action is somewhat too sublime to be natural	213.56549992010272
you think so	85.41723646719024
i am sure of it	7.629226583770257
to whom was this letter addressed	88.96721210670903
to m	76.10886613117964
noirtier rue coqhron no	49.72466336407088
13 paris	5.687044259905319
now can you conceive of any interest that your heroic deputy could possibly have	163.94534024063347
why it is not altogether impossible he might have had for he made me promise sev	65.86830410709636
noirtier repeated the abb noirtieri knew a person of that name at the court of t	41.64138503452949
de villefort the abb burst into a fit of laughter while dants gazed on him in ut	35.93402396351602
what ails you said he at length	24.758229622006947
do you see that ray of sunlight	39.49996597086221
i do	20.10391023603266
well the whole thing is more clear to me than that sunbeam is to you	36.14687342787419
poor fellow poor young man and you tell me this magistrate expressed great sympa	92.87219036529429
he did	69.72854904053555
and the worthy man destroyed your compromising letter	277.754357722704
and then made you swear never to utter the name of noirtier	104.9368204935745
why you poor shortsighted simpleton can you not guess who this noirtier was whos	110.06958395347635
had a thunderbolt fallen at the feet of dants or hell opened its yawning gulf be	86.04297312732226
starting up he clasped his hands around his head as though to prevent his very b	59.55116513125069
yes his father replied the abb his right name was noirtier de villefort	52.03241372018649
at this instant a bright light shot through the mind of dants and cleared up all	37.87231467740599
the change that had come over villefort during the examination the destruction o	121.08064531679965
he cried out and staggered against the wall like a drunken man then he hurried t	78.52212499357904
when he regained his dungeon he threw himself on his bed where the turnkey found	45.65130919911486
during these hours of profound meditation which to him had seemed only minutes h	148.26780022476686
dants was at length roused from his reverie by the voice of faria who having als	29.62828068889894
the reputation of being out of his mind though harmlessly and even amusingly so 	117.7774610745216
he was supplied with bread of a finer whiter quality than the usual prison fare 	147.192278622452
now this was a sunday and the abb had come to ask his young companion to share t	41.41189676668815
dants followed him his features were no longer contracted and now wore their usu	106.60366878949324
faria bent on him his penetrating eye	105.69693197762062
i regret now said he having helped you in your late inquiries or having given yo	149.8185901628745
why so inquired dants	30.218481364758322
because it has instilled a new passion in your heartthat of vengeance	139.54457106761177
dants smiled	139.27467985200687
let us talk of something else said he	24.456996778226838
again the abb looked at him then mournfully shook his head but in accordance wit	60.100795800907406
the elder prisoner was one of those persons whose conversation like that of all 	76.53196320210766
dants listened with admiring attention to all he said some of his remarks corres	76.29406905835907
a part of the good abbs words however were wholly incomprehensible to him but li	152.22274086657242
you must teach me a small part of what you know said dants if only to prevent yo	52.491970717790295
i can well believe that so learned a person as yourself would prefer absolute so	223.86659573146986
if you will only agree to my request i promise you never to mention another word	94.51098472947372
the abb smiled	30.826391532768056
alas my boy said he human knowledge is confined within very narrow limits and wh	181.30341386009457
now it will scarcely require two years for me to communicate to you the stock of	58.10030900584453
two years exclaimed dants do you really believe i can acquire all these things i	77.64288549275315
not their application certainly but their principles you may to learn is not to 	225.96241303072546
memory makes the one philosophy the other	161.65215487235338
but can not one learn philosophy	597.1660555774101
philosophy can not be taught it is the application of the sciences to truth it i	66.72283300951011
well then said dants what shall you teach me first i am in a hurry to begin	22.64286236887593
i want to learn	70.9497550047485
everything said the abb	9.557155346562153
and that very evening the prisoners sketched a plan of education to be entered u	102.94696208649505
dants possessed a prodigious memory combined with an astonishing quickness and r	128.07766197588268
he already knew italian and had also picked up a little of the romaic dialect du	82.58341080395631
in strict accordance with the promise made to the abb dants spoke no more of esc	60.52990213698793
perhaps the delight his studies afforded him left no room for such thoughts perh	233.40964168101337
days even months passed by unheeded in one rapid and instructive course	284.4654705880089
at the end of a year dants was a new man	14.445280002061846
dants observed however that faria in spite of the relief his society afforded da	71.77037828871079
sometimes he would fall into long reveries sigh heavily and involuntarily then s	290.49559738267646
one day he stopped all at once and exclaimed	94.01946675268648
ah if there were no sentinel	61.51595368911511
there shall not be one a minute longer than you please said dants who had follow	68.08890161931298
i have already told you answered the abb that i loathe the idea of shedding bloo	27.725303922771126
and yet the murder if you choose to call it so would be simply a measure of self	132.25290466471927
no matter i could never agree to it	55.866848450358475
still you have thought of it	29.82871657245055
incessantly alas cried the abb	100.20363217606078
and you have discovered a means of regaining our freedom have you not asked dant	67.0908728603307
i have if it were only possible to place a deaf and blind sentinel in the galler	75.09884789769684
he shall be both blind and deaf replied the young man with an air of determinati	35.253997128629535
no no cried the abb impossible	40.92811620132396
dants endeavored to renew the subject the abb shook his head in token of disappr	28.241752764547535
three months passed away	29.01991008654766
are you strong the abb asked one day of dants	68.36999789277057
the young man in reply took up the chisel bent it into the form of a horseshoe a	42.784147575244575
and will you engage not to do any harm to the sentry except as a last resort	111.42893266424625
i promise on my honor	47.29557324750521
then said the abb we may hope to put our design into execution	65.61144535377272
and how long shall we be in accomplishing the necessary work	74.83924598287734
at least a year	52.88046711561444
and shall we begin at once	89.53271692502388
at once	116.16527281280695
we have lost a year to no purpose cried dants	54.85315210004979
do you consider the last twelve months to have been wasted asked the abb	47.90400140428959
forgive me cried edmond blushing deeply	16.013528940239297
tut tut answered the abb man is but man after all and you are about the best spe	108.29090045728526
come let me show you my plan	45.93381724041131
the abb then showed dants the sketch he had made for their escape	88.20413423232837
it consisted of a plan of his own cell and that of dants with the passage which 	66.89517937403544
in this passage he proposed to drive a level as they do in mines this level woul	79.65984687483378
the prisoners were then to make their way through one of the gallery windows and	51.99221064770894
dants eyes sparkled with joy and he rubbed his hands with delight at the idea of	25.66895824762955
that very day the miners began their labors with a vigor and alacrity proportion	160.1960491988627
nothing interrupted the progress of the work except the necessity that each was 	183.21956697034747
they had learned to distinguish the almost imperceptible sound of his footsteps 	79.58543149557497
the fresh earth excavated during their present work and which would have entirel	186.04940001330897
more than a year had been consumed in this undertaking the only tools for which 	67.20732661023835
the abb was a man of the world and had moreover mixed in the first society of th	27.56581015842617

compelled as they were to await a night sufficiently dark to favor their flight 	267.59756124617724
dants was occupied in arranging this piece of wood when he heard faria who had r	44.58382606905457
dants hastened to his dungeon where he found him standing in the middle of the r	25.819028164227216

quick quick returned the abb listen to what i have to say	40.77432667517266
dants looked in fear and wonder at the livid countenance of faria whose eyes alr	54.851765848445005

in spite of the magnitude of the misfortune which thus suddenly frustrated his h	53.72389475774727

help help cried the abb iidiei	36.44887337376026

so sudden and violent was the fit that the unfortunate prisoner was unable to co	90.38328182468382
the fit lasted two hours then more helpless than an infant and colder and paler 	205.886070485042
edmond waited till life seemed extinct in the body of his friend then taking up 	170.0625134672801
an hour passed away and the old man gave no sign of returning animation	39.09205712977284
dants began to fear he had delayed too long ere he administered the remedy and t	84.60134241512353
at length a slight color tinged the livid cheeks consciousness returned to the d	71.32209676904625
he is saved he is saved cried dants in a paroxysm of delight	35.55425864722416
the sick man was not yet able to speak but he pointed with evident anxiety towar	62.22250809023048
dants listened and plainly distinguished the approaching steps of the jailer	182.96454882447307
it was therefore near seven oclock but edmonds anxiety had put all thoughts of t	104.59058114161792
the young man sprang to the entrance darted through it carefully drawing the sto	60.882184888191965
he had scarcely done so before the door opened and the jailer saw the prisoner s	38.36110069422835
almost before the key had turned in the lock and before the departing steps of t	56.51075537651406
faria had now fully regained his consciousness but he still lay helpless and exh	148.36362913292345
i did not expect to see you again said he feebly to dants	26.762728524766697
and why not asked the young man	18.480860871956843
did you fancy yourself dying	688.9637622491157
no i had no such idea but knowing that all was ready for flight i thought you mi	55.47778264308524
the deep glow of indignation suffused the cheeks of dants	56.605119627370335
without you did you really think me capable of that	90.01829024283539
at least said the abb i now see how wrong such an opinion would have been	86.63986496344874
alas alas i am fearfully exhausted and debilitated by this attack	127.24752251247678
be of good cheer replied dants your strength will return	153.88290257710642
and as he spoke he seated himself near the bed beside faria and took his hands	50.9783733671837
the abb shook his head	10.237109323264855
the last attack i had said he lasted but half an hour and after it i was hungry 	87.7357513679539
the third attack will either carry me off or leave me paralyzed for life	263.2588477569637

the attack which has just passed away condemns me forever to the walls of a pris	68.33632898541195
none can fly from a dungeon who can not walk	92.11821699978705
well we will waita week a month two months if need beand meanwhile your strength	315.18582452956167
everything is in readiness for our flight and we can select any time we choose	84.39987735713387
as soon as you feel able to swim we will go	78.61316243524519
i shall never swim again replied faria	39.71009109115673
this arm is paralyzed not for a time but forever	206.95510553611658
lift it and judge if i am mistaken	46.65239768405191
the young man raised the arm which fell back by its own weight perfectly inanima	55.67396669313594
a sigh escaped him	165.120046486449
you are convinced now edmond are you not asked the abb	33.703131678450404
depend upon it i know what i say	46.30294448980436
since the first attack i experienced of this malady i have continually reflected	108.00191229586366
indeed i expected it for it is a family inheritance both my father and grandfath	54.94236428817567
the physician who prepared for me the remedy i have twice successfully taken was	256.2459716024947

my son said the abb you who are a sailor and a swimmer must know as well as i do	27.343062987128015

it is well said dants	6.534080830934309
then i shall also remain	153.81658398609682
then rising and extending his hand with an air of solemnity over the old mans he	40.50657937396848
faria gazed fondly on his nobleminded singlehearted highprincipled young friend 	222.85170235732866
thanks murmured the invalid extending one hand	124.49677166366699
i accept	663.0099066631834
you may one of these days reap the reward of your disinterested devotion	118.89306411545388
but as i can not and you will not quit this place it becomes necessary to fill u	57.90233905690664
that would bring about a discovery which would inevitably lead to our being sepa	134.04086578267172
go then and set about this work in which unhappily i can offer you no assistance	90.71211373977691
i shall have something of the greatest importance to communicate to you	45.339147267942025
dants took the hand of the abb in his and affectionately pressed it	37.03438938539279
faria smiled encouragingly on him and the young man retired to his task in the s	45.631178016609816
chapter 18	813.2323832197145
the treasure	979.0393973433443

in the ray of light which entered by the narrow window of his cell he held open 	53.20664640660366
he did not speak but showed the paper to dants	37.563759534113515
what is that he inquired	11.72504488340515
look at it said the abb with a smile	6.9390584464894225
i have looked at it with all possible attention said dants and i only see a half	67.38770414485367

with his instinctive delicacy edmond had preferred avoiding any touch on this pa	145.16567981384622

faria smiled	82.28679205422723
yes said he	10.241772154445725
you have indeed a noble nature edmond and i see by your paleness and agitation w	51.22466338199831
no be assured i am not mad	51.98764915331294
this treasure exists dants and if i have not been allowed to possess it you will	45.25904260705002

on the contrary it is a matter of the utmost importance edmond replied the old m	26.23455529022331
who knows if tomorrow or the next day after the third attack may not come on and	74.90075845625451
this idea was one of vengeance to me and i tasted it slowly in the night of my d	61.300703596771015

you persist in your incredulity edmond continued faria	89.63134825568359
my words have not convinced you	187.85583960963115
i see you require proofs	407.0740281104362
well then read this paper which i have never shown to anyone	69.84438548766528
tomorrow my dear friend said edmond desirous of not yielding to the old mans mad	49.432050177433155
i thought it was understood that we should not talk of that until tomorrow	45.280110753775965
then we will not talk of it until tomorrow but read this paper today	103.02636950681693

faria sat up to receive him avoiding all gestures in order that he might conceal	85.75261321256224
his fear was lest the governor touched with pity might order him to be removed t	215.4212277442397

his holiness had an idea	102.39750847201786

in the first place he could sell the great appointments and splendid offices whi	55.05313853029804
there was a third point in view which will appear hereafter	95.3193522570422
the pope and csar borgia first found the two future cardinals they were giovanni	104.60414738910036
they were ambitious and csar borgia soon found purchasers for their appointments	193.43752013232825
the result was that rospigliosi and spada paid for being cardinals and eight oth	67.21126850076271

then the pope and csar borgia invited the two cardinals to dinner	82.83123854337309
this was a matter of dispute between the holy father and his son	41.94550512421741

the first sight that attracted the eyes of spada was that of his nephew in full 	60.53783995671393

it is the declaration of cardinal spada and the will so long sought for replied 	103.62435019312576
yes a thousand times yes	129.50746662776334
and who completed it as it now is	121.42413972359803

no no be easy on that score the family is extinct	73.82981009475573
the last count of spada moreover made me his heir bequeathing to me this symboli	67.9093671895345
if we lay hands on this fortune we may enjoy it without remorse	136.39043546195686
and you say this treasure amounts to	70.62726419292282
two millions of roman crowns nearly thirteen millions of our money	139.5932868759891
impossible said dants staggered at the enormous amount	105.42140090070482
impossible and why asked the old man	21.29219956184601
the spada family was one of the oldest and most powerful families of the fifteen	44.88478371404895
edmond thought he was in a dreamhe wavered between incredulity and joy	59.380380132178466
i have only kept this secret so long from you continued faria that i might test 	101.95545859241477
had we escaped before my attack of catalepsy i should have conducted you to mont	98.78531040358897
well dants you do not thank me	30.900638109640898
this treasure belongs to you my dear friend replied dants and to you only	33.841536486032915
i have no right to it	31.002111912338844
i am no relation of yours	73.92171656680499
you are my son dants exclaimed the old man	19.64845547648719
you are the child of my captivity	42.19652797247635

the third attack	141.14976251087438
now that this treasure which had so long been the object of the abbs meditations	65.34701871113889
the abb did not know the island of monte cristo but dants knew it and had often 	29.58657635397635
this island was always had been and still is completely deserted	265.4812984615414
it is a rock of almost conical form which looks as though it had been thrust up 	56.293661877350935
dants drew a plan of the island for faria and faria gave dants advice as to the 	60.87997858068001
but dants was far from being as enthusiastic and confident as the old man	62.08194227602625
it was past a question now that faria was not a lunatic and the way in which he 	42.332219512228775
however as if fate resolved on depriving the prisoners of their last chance and 	181.14898957283646
they had repaired it completely and stopped up with vast masses of stone the hol	100.82161584694684
but for this precaution which it will be remembered the abb had made to edmond t	41.608595575097034
thus a new a stronger and more inexorable barrier was interposed to cut off the 	135.72576620056955
you see said the young man with an air of sorrowful resignation to faria that go	15.55872778771542
i have promised to remain forever with you and now i could not break my promise 	51.401517826377734
the treasure will be no more mine than yours and neither of us will quit this pr	84.17926140644931
but my real treasure is not that my dear friend which awaits me beneath the somb	46.59078473409397

i owe you my real good my present happiness and all the sovereigns of the earth 	53.123507542845786
thus if not actually happy yet the days these two unfortunates passed together w	189.4938617604964
faria who for so long a time had kept silence as to the treasure now perpetually	257.1856021968802
as he had prophesied would be the case he remained paralyzed in the right arm an	106.33277086959353
but he was continually thinking over some means of escape for his young companio	95.98283821478813
for fear the letter might be some day lost or stolen he compelled dants to learn	200.98107217091254
then he destroyed the second portion assured that if the first were seized no on	154.08217690463778
whole hours sometimes passed while faria was giving instructions to dantsinstruc	247.1089966261977
then once free from the day and hour and moment when he was so he could have but	144.79444182003627
in the meanwhile the hours passed if not rapidly at least tolerably	177.34462330337794
faria as we have said without having recovered the use of his hand and foot had 	64.80624534785832
they were thus perpetually employedfaria that he might not see himself grow old 	167.64738726618344
so life went on for them as it does for those who are not victims of misfortune 	137.3652808943217
but beneath this superficial calm there were in the heart of the young man and p	45.38538227263049
one night edmond awoke suddenly believing that he heard someone calling him	201.81243261100636
he opened his eyes upon utter darkness	140.64580611981694
his name or rather a plaintive voice which essayed to pronounce his name reached	83.2661721323441
he sat up in bed and a cold sweat broke out upon his brow	48.64687276610316
undoubtedly the call came from farias dungeon	324.06708481709245
alas murmured edmond can it be	30.715377995549627
he moved his bed drew up the stone rushed into the passage and reached the oppos	51.801799529348905
by the light of the wretched and wavering lamp of which we have spoken dants saw	48.63324665083262
his features were writhing with those horrible symptoms which he already knew an	212.50760897130704
alas my dear friend said faria in a resigned tone you understand do you not and 	19.645986870123725
edmond uttered a cry of agony and quite out of his senses rushed towards the doo	37.64753673071657
faria had just sufficient strength to restrain him	103.56946806567342
silence he said or you are lost	43.5347647571081

at length providence has done something for you he restores to you more than he 	112.95421883158359
edmond could only clasp his hands and exclaim oh my friend my friend speak not t	79.52268811402872
see he exclaimed there remains still some of the magic draught	142.7602117437845

the cold gains upon me	543.7165474744454
i feel the blood flowing towards my brain	142.34997948197642
these horrible chills which make my teeth chatter and seem to dislocate my bones	225.96015034928155

now lift me on my bed for i can no longer support myself	71.56888413507225
edmond took the old man in his arms and laid him on the bed	18.76288045352755
and now my dear friend said faria sole consolation of my wretched existenceyou w	57.92423791651374

the young man cast himself on his knees leaning his head against the old mans be	47.05510270887528
listen now to what i say in this my dying moment	182.17599418066538
the treasure of the spadas exists	55.57315135406132

hasten to monte cristoavail yourself of the fortunefor you have indeed suffered 	84.45684324482042
a violent convulsion attacked the old man	125.33699254205492
dants raised his head and saw farias eyes injected with blood	48.73188143928224
it seemed as if a flow of blood had ascended from the chest to the head	38.886157243375955

and raising himself by a final effort in which he summoned all his faculties he 	109.60988339992562
the crisis was terrible and a rigid form with twisted limbs swollen eyelids and 	142.3038300877476
dants took the lamp placed it on a projecting stone above the bed whence its tre	78.83324846283189
with steady gaze he awaited confidently the moment for administering the restora	164.67092194823275
when he believed that the right moment had arrived he took the knife pried open 	108.27618487652975
he waited ten minutes a quarter of an hour half an hourno change took place	51.14591405840154
trembling his hair erect his brow bathed with perspiration he counted the second	78.90353665173434

0255 m	1.0177723176513598
the draught produced a galvanic effect a violent trembling pervaded the old mans	204.47330546430084
half an hour an hour an hour and a half elapsed and during this period of anguis	38.86654436921104
it was six oclock in the morning the dawn was just breaking and its feeble ray c	48.02717728255155
strange shadows passed over the countenance of the dead man and at times gave it	66.63434801168513
while the struggle between day and night lasted dants still doubted but as soon 	242.95344824333336
then an invincible and extreme terror seized upon him and he dared not again pre	172.97609737586566
he extinguished the lamp carefully concealed it and then went away closing as we	166.98694410365331
it was time for the jailer was coming	57.08175938781745
on this occasion he began his rounds at dants cell and on leaving him he went on	50.01671903934578
nothing betokened that the man knew anything of what had occurred	88.3285904425552
he went on his way	33.19176926165707
dants was then seized with an indescribable desire to know what was going on in 	68.61507667169923
he therefore returned by the subterraneous gallery and arrived in time to hear t	78.79585466527446
other turnkeys came and then was heard the regular tramp of soldiers	179.68623254004564
last of all came the governor	113.83904409085575
edmond heard the creaking of the bed as they moved the corpse heard the voice of	82.6335946863171
the governor then went out and words of pity fell on dants listening ears mingle	263.74598391840755
well well said one the madman has gone to look after his treasure	159.4723900064611
good journey to him	75.13022394125912
with all his millions he will not have enough to pay for his shroud said another	72.25065217585093
oh added a third voice the shrouds of the chteau dif are not dear	34.32573442353782

they may give him the honors of the sack	54.03140072489248
edmond did not lose a word but comprehended very little of what was said	88.43158770419804
the voices soon ceased and it seemed to him as if everyone had left the cell	87.0067148758095
still he dared not to enter as they might have left some turnkey to watch the de	119.69626498030333
he remained therefore mute and motionless hardly venturing to breathe	147.65708574713074
at the end of an hour he heard a faint noise which increased	14.963645510377146
it was the governor who returned followed by the doctor and other attendants	106.72110587916316
there was a moments silenceit was evident that the doctor was examining the dead	73.74378452341625
the inquiries soon commenced	497.4711207169084
the doctor analyzed the symptoms of the malady to which the prisoner had succumb	36.779878099145215
questions and answers followed in a nonchalant manner that made dants indignant 	206.6632072848933
i am very sorry for what you tell me said the governor replying to the assurance	24.858425625607186
ah added the turnkey there was no occasion for watching him he would have stayed	89.93106790118895
still said the governor i believe it will be requisite notwithstanding your cert	41.13490192856079
there was a moment of complete silence during which dants still listening knew t	51.11459691442768
you may make your mind easy said the doctor he is dead	31.88904807987104
i will answer for that	27.268950240778317
you know sir said the governor persisting that we are not content in such cases 	32.722279718682664
in spite of all appearances be so kind therefore as to finish your duty by fulfi	118.53926263995827
let the irons be heated said the doctor but really it is a useless precaution	58.70327165796304
this order to heat the irons made dants shudder	218.3027486120337
he heard hasty steps the creaking of a door people going and coming and some min	240.01798170335283
here is the brazier lighted	96.75875340688887
there was a moments silence and then was heard the crackling of burning flesh of	33.12093177729963
the perspiration poured forth upon the young mans brow and he felt as if he shou	37.4445936984335
you see sir he is really dead said the doctor this burn in the heel is decisive	76.37429238925269
the poor fool is cured of his folly and delivered from his captivity	93.84724573409454
was nt his name faria inquired one of the officers who accompanied the governor	52.58427526432171

yes sir and as he said it was an ancient name	42.921626392394145
he was too very learned and rational enough on all points which did not relate t	96.12312858756832
it is the sort of malady which we call monomania said the doctor	59.97334441172145
you had never anything to complain of said the governor to the jailer who had ch	37.719079492605395
never sir replied the jailer never on the contrary he sometimes amused me very m	101.5366664534896
one day too when my wife was ill he gave me a prescription which cured her	74.96389427705182
ah ah said the doctor i did not know that i had a rival but i hope governor that	26.9355318713419
yes yes make your mind easy he shall be decently interred in the newest sack we 	79.21873998554221
will that satisfy you	541.0568006471651
must this last formality take place in your presence sir inquired a turnkey	130.43790543343306
but make hastei can not stay here all day	169.31640446788953
other footsteps going and coming were now heard and a moment afterwards the nois	151.00695240063396
this evening said the governor	23.23813939840781
will there be any mass asked one of the attendants	123.24528534943727
that is impossible replied the governor	21.400934746782788
the chaplain of the chteau came to me yesterday to beg for leave of absence in o	96.47661540313896
i told him i would attend to the prisoners in his absence	77.88765942410669
if the poor abb had not been in such a hurry he might have had his requiem	34.66988685476546
pooh pooh said the doctor with the impiety usual in persons of his profession he	72.82145309985647
god will respect his profession and not give the devil the wicked delight of sen	178.02463844141047
a shout of laughter followed this brutal jest	213.52935121180934
meanwhile the operation of putting the body in the sack was going on	104.14407928649457
this evening said the governor when the task was ended	45.22018078136668
at what hour inquired a turnkey	173.7236702362889
why about ten or eleven oclock	200.67970483367688
shall we watch by the corpse	134.69227409304625
of what use would it be shut the dungeon as if he were alivethat is all	104.97375487005739
then the steps retreated and the voices died away in the distance the noise of t	62.80643672116149
then he raised the flagstone cautiously with his head and looked carefully aroun	59.91957659486922
it was empty and dants emerged from the tunnel	46.85929424784719

everything was in readiness	44.10176210540659
a barrier had been placed between dants and his old friend	76.1699693002099
no longer could edmond look into those wideopen eyes which had seemed to be pene	94.36796233023678
faria the beneficent and cheerful companion with whom he was accustomed to live 	94.96154708025215
he seated himself on the edge of that terrible bed and fell into melancholy and 	77.29487395686303

but how to die it is very easy he went on with a smile i will remain here rush o	68.15220983615059
but excessive grief is like a storm at sea where the frail bark is tossed from t	126.99959809076839
dants recoiled from the idea of so infamous a death and passed suddenly from des	148.08084705764168

yet they will forget me here and i shall die in my dungeon like faria	39.588618301075066
as he said this he became silent and gazed straight before him like one overwhel	113.44855431646819
suddenly he arose lifted his hand to his brow as if his brain were giddy paced t	37.88595162180442
just god he muttered whence comes this thought is it from thee since none but th	280.1869443785778
without giving himself time to reconsider his decision and indeed that he might 	113.61561896230579
he would have been discovered by the beating of his heart if by any mischance th	40.78826948448663
dants might have waited until the evening visit was over but he was afraid that 	91.38901403279696
in that case his last hope would have been destroyed	48.98378217713943
now his plans were fully made and this is what he intended to do	93.48529271342315
if while he was being carried out the gravediggers should discover that they wer	159.81639594055466
0263 m	1.0260500912234238
if they took him to the cemetery and laid him in a grave he would allow himself 	63.01639603481055
he hoped that the weight of earth would not be so great that he could not overco	27.90786206153274
if he was detected in this and the earth proved too heavy he would be stifled an	125.24851132662415
dants had not eaten since the preceding evening but he had not thought of hunger	58.2415233712693
his situation was too precarious to allow him even time to reflect on any though	202.32455260199268
the first risk that dants ran was that the jailer when he brought him his supper	220.17444125173824
this time the jailer might not be as silent as usual but speak to dants and seei	36.32001909912223
when seven oclock came dants agony really began	374.85522993229966
his hand placed upon his heart was unable to redress its throbbings while with t	81.25989724500863
from time to time chills ran through his whole body and clutched his heart in a 	64.79629565939454

yet the hours passed on without any unusual disturbance and dants knew that he h	58.24546708937822
it was a good augury	27.1782893897425
at length about the hour the governor had appointed footsteps were heard on the 	66.61935249720294
edmond felt that the moment had arrived summoned up all his courage held his bre	75.18907143309455
the footstepsthey were doublepaused at the doorand dants guessed that the two gr	120.1583828933532
the door opened and a dim light reached dants eyes through the coarse sack that 	76.3046563283844
the two men approaching the ends of the bed took the sack by its extremities	63.12008868592626
he s heavy though for an old and thin man said one as he raised the head	134.6556700874144
they say every year adds half a pound to the weight of the bones said another li	126.10468896270912
have you tied the knot inquired the first speaker	72.35694517281402
what would be the use of carrying so much more weight was the reply i can do tha	67.66467953233749
yes you re right replied the companion	106.42230006872666
what s the knot for thought dants	209.9811500548681
they deposited the supposed corpse on the bier	250.3574293289163
edmond stiffened himself in order to play the part of a dead man and then the pa	41.54189564878791
suddenly he felt the fresh and sharp night air and dants knew that the mistral w	80.67975455667991
it was a sensation in which pleasure and pain were strangely mingled	95.07273217033344
the bearers went on for twenty paces then stopped putting the bier down on the g	80.89991676956642
one of them went away and dants heard his shoes striking on the pavement	47.28465920019212
where am i he asked himself	120.07762271117703
really he is by no means a light load said the other bearer sitting on the edge 	67.7021173242453
dants first impulse was to escape but fortunately he did not attempt it	82.12881716703217
give us a light said the other bearer or i shall never find what i am looking fo	52.72766881446756
the man with the torch complied although not asked in the most polite terms	257.20056418158146
what can he be looking for thought edmond	52.98857490879892
the spade perhaps	7823.539772021415
an exclamation of satisfaction indicated that the gravedigger had found the obje	51.52820736484782
here it is at last he said not without some trouble though	79.08490500567488
yes was the answer but it has lost nothing by waiting	118.45614509995832
as he said this the man came towards edmond who heard a heavy metallic substance	61.87916812806414
well have you tied the knot inquired the gravedigger who was looking on	80.92159943528708
yes and pretty tight too i can tell you was the answer	102.23806630401084
move on then	131.82225574276345
and the bier was lifted once more and they proceeded	169.53226949206004
they advanced fifty paces farther and then stopped to open a door then went forw	83.03248291294996

bad weather observed one of the bearers not a pleasant night for a dip in the se	64.84074118639502
why yes the abb runs a chance of being wet said the other and then there was a b	64.09094663735046
dants did not comprehend the jest but his hair stood erect on his head	36.67078715515145
well here we are at last said one of them	44.48788027837465
a little farthera little farther said the other	262.80005340811124
you know very well that the last was stopped on his way dashed on the rocks and 	54.45666733285305
they ascended five or six more steps and then dants felt that they took him one 	75.97264089117068
one said the gravediggers two three	171.20625438559898
and at the same instant dants felt himself flung into the air like a wounded bir	34.68820075863285
although drawn downwards by the heavy weight which hastened his rapid descent it	411.3694321808713
at last with a horrible splash he darted like an arrow into the icecold water an	119.69061462661493
dants had been flung into the sea and was dragged into its depths by a thirtysix	55.379857588004064

the island of tiboulen	14.905453487658614
dants although stunned and almost suffocated had sufficient presence of mind to 	385.577033728209
he then bent his body and by a desperate effort severed the cord that bound his 	92.5035876243203
with a mighty leap he rose to the surface of the sea while the shot dragged down	58.364849118639846
dants waited only to get breath and then dived in order to avoid being seen	124.40609545990597
when he arose a second time he was fifty paces from where he had first sunk	51.83951936708841
he saw overhead a black and tempestuous sky across which the wind was driving cl	92.90368227531853
behind him blacker than the sea blacker than the sky rose phantomlike the vast s	179.835550975446
he fancied that these two forms were looking at the sea doubtless these strange 	175.2835942708714
dants dived again and remained a long time beneath the water	100.46887946300392
this was an easy feat to him for he usually attracted a crowd of spectators in t	69.05256662006174
when he came up again the light had disappeared	58.35850410299283
he must now get his bearings	326.2888871634482
ratonneau and pomgue are the nearest islands of all those that surround the chte	51.39312378420212
tiboulen and lemaire were therefore the safest for dants venture	97.31492655193942
the islands of tiboulen and lemaire are a league from the chteau dif dants never	30.030930841583167
but how could he find his way in the darkness of the night	26.412422981051762
at this moment he saw the light of planier gleaming in front of him like a star	25.144979410899918
by leaving this light on the right he kept the island of tiboulen a little on th	41.82297722145139
but as we have said it was at least a league from the chteau dif to this island	22.705674257345148
often in prison faria had said to him when he saw him idle and inactive	55.31277121849557
dants you must not give way to this listlessness you will be drowned if you seek	96.43057675270212
these words rang in dants ears even beneath the waves he hastened to cleave his 	104.00988580799634
he found with pleasure that his captivity had taken away nothing of his power an	70.79895941979223
fear that relentless pursuer clogged dants efforts	569.6090219826136
he listened for any sound that might be audible and every time that he rose to t	83.48045412544326
he fancied that every wave behind him was a pursuing boat and he redoubled his e	180.22494425013858
he swam on still and already the terrible chteau had disappeared in the darkness	110.21590507902808
he could not see it but he felt its presence	58.45149414419031
an hour passed during which dants excited by the feeling of freedom continued to	65.6103190683344

but what if i were mistaken	44.39656526136936
a shudder passed over him	97.08383415512849
he sought to tread water in order to rest himself but the sea was too violent an	106.96381468706207
well said he i will swim on until i am worn out or the cramp seizes me and then 	60.977073636814815
suddenly the sky seemed to him to become still darker and more dense and heavy c	77.46098270795602
he fancied for a moment that he had been shot and listened for the report but he	34.85858099961216

at the expiration of an hour edmond was awakened by the roar of thunder	13.649348708002902

an overhanging rock offered him a temporary shelter and scarcely had he availed 	203.67759640355564
edmond felt the trembling of the rock beneath which he lay the waves dashing the	58.065854969192074

dants cried at the top of his voice to warn them of their danger but they saw it	59.68642767378662
another flash showed him four men clinging to the shattered mast and the rigging	107.33950770197913
the men he beheld saw him undoubtedly for their cries were carried to his ears b	169.12347385022252
above the splintered mast a sail rent to tatters was waving suddenly the ropes t	241.4569021298817
at the same moment a violent crash was heard and cries of distress	21.61106025802125
dants from his rocky perch saw the shattered vessel and among the fragments the 	152.4690772623513

soon a red streak became visible in the horizon the waves whitened a light playe	95.4066141970654
it was day	193.57020414514804
dants stood mute and motionless before this majestic spectacle as if he now behe	75.82060536530437
he turned towards the fortress and looked at both sea and land	106.55599848124504
the gloomy building rose from the bosom of the ocean with imposing majesty and s	140.55945273150374
it was about five oclock	15.56835689211123

as dants his eyes turned in the direction of the chteau dif uttered this prayer 	48.244530002617914
she was coming out of marseilles harbor and was standing out to sea rapidly her 	74.69464290587672

my story will be accepted for there is no one left to contradict me	54.768837641876836
as he spoke dants looked toward the spot where the fishingvessel had been wrecke	21.655752631338327
the red cap of one of the sailors hung to a point of the rock and some timbers t	61.59726003993037
in an instant dants plan was formed	94.93551396262032
he swam to the cap placed it on his head seized one of the timbers and struck ou	61.292519616199115
i am saved murmured he	128.5961733781539
and this conviction restored his strength	381.1485309364771
he soon saw that the vessel with the wind dead ahead was tacking between the cht	99.6825087670212
for an instant he feared lest instead of keeping in shore she should stand out t	79.69202647719318

he rose on the waves making signs of distress but no one on board saw him and th	85.53168322516964
dants would have shouted but he knew that the wind would drown his voice	89.83039336058422
it was then he rejoiced at his precaution in taking the timber for without it he	119.58547541744703
dants though almost sure as to what course the vessel would take had yet watched	563.4662279252525
then he advanced but before they could meet the vessel again changed her course	166.30245607970977

at the same time he saw they were about to lower the boat	19.7630776477256
an instant after the boat rowed by two men advanced rapidly towards him	106.04880595596366
dants let go of the timber which he now thought to be useless and swam vigorousl	102.3038036542865
but he had reckoned too much upon his strength and then he realized how servicea	100.25892983172906
his arms became stiff his legs lost their flexibility and he was almost breathle	117.89759381256526
he shouted again	318.14050777561266
the two sailors redoubled their efforts and one of them cried in italian courage	111.79924923281574
the word reached his ear as a wave which he no longer had the strength to surmou	58.422542470311015
he rose again to the surface struggled with the last desperate effort of a drown	84.13640301427834
the water passed over his head and the sky turned gray	105.25283358177857
a convulsive movement again brought him to the surface	153.1247365829576
he felt himself seized by the hair then he saw and heard nothing	115.83273347884034
he had fainted	72.14984770508065
when he opened his eyes dants found himself on the deck of the tartan	27.06390295516471
his first care was to see what course they were taking	105.11926652814678
they were rapidly leaving the chteau dif behind	116.84837245803588
dants was so exhausted that the exclamation of joy he uttered was mistaken for a	65.7446082691628

a few drops of the rum restored suspended animation while the friction of his li	68.16712782391117
who are you said the pilot in bad french	72.30752000703283
i am replied dants in bad italian a maltese sailor	69.85431090352796
we were coming from syracuse laden with grain	117.57001797913972
the storm of last night overtook us at cape morgiou and we were wrecked on these	135.96712387090287
where do you come from	16.32774410414034
from these rocks that i had the good luck to cling to while our captain and the 	131.2119413230177
i saw your vessel and fearful of being left to perish on the desolate island i s	147.55608427407316
you have saved my life and i thank you continued dants	26.50094607433764

it was i said a sailor of a frank and manly appearance and it was time for you w	40.247642537641845

i almost hesitated though replied the sailor you looked more like a brigand than	329.91743629604787
dants recollected that his hair and beard had not been cut all the time he was a	52.1982660211864
yes said he i made a vow to our lady of the grotto not to cut my hair or beard f	77.16660733249152
now what are we to do with you said the captain	11.484360536707339
alas anything you please	536.6394645573148
my captain is dead i have barely escaped but i am a good sailor	83.95521873969132
leave me at the first port you make i shall be sure to find employment	57.105362882842755
do you know the mediterranean	7.341869088067287
i have sailed over it since my childhood	141.6918694002861
you know the best harbors	54.07360604419944
there are few ports that i could not enter or leave with a bandage over my eyes	122.12273104318211
i say captain said the sailor who had cried courage to dants if what he says is 	92.30148007380029
if he says true said the captain doubtingly	134.18443328252295
but in his present condition he will promise anything and take his chance of kee	74.96471642967742
i will do more than i promise said dants	30.703582719802327
we shall see returned the other smiling	56.87917706494026
where are you going asked dants	5.183126221813969
to leghorn	12.715947720026309
then why instead of tacking so frequently do you not sail nearer the wind	275.1346064978496
because we should run straight on to the island of rion	48.07877835660381
you shall pass it by twenty fathoms	118.38764946521222
take the helm and let us see what you know	28.155737429217965
the young man took the helm felt to see if the vessel answered the rudder prompt	90.69680279514799
to the sheets said he	61.38163764183821
the four seamen who composed the crew obeyed while the pilot looked on	139.77825550483175
haul taut	6739.632063882076
they obeyed	1784.9112377328966
this order was also executed and the vessel passed as dants had predicted twenty	85.83930298027525
bravo said the captain	12.124371030705404
bravo repeated the sailors	97.27498144819045
and they all looked with astonishment at this man whose eye now disclosed an int	141.91974294687193
you see said dants quitting the helm i shall be of some use to you at least duri	48.47028490153988
if you do not want me at leghorn you can leave me there and i will pay you out o	20.676019140759244
ah said the captain we can agree very well if you are reasonable	44.105936630711874
give me what you give the others and it will be all right returned dants	52.0094314165787
that s not fair said the seaman who had saved dants for you know more than we do	62.407269946336655
what is that to you jacopo returned the captain	24.785456591064218
everyone is free to ask what he pleases	90.7939023624458
that s true replied jacopo i only make a remark	41.54421333361677
well you would do much better to find him a jacket and a pair of trousers if you	41.929947095739095
no said jacopo but i have a shirt and a pair of trousers	22.29451208381778
that is all i want interrupted dants	32.827669242174196
jacopo dived into the hold and soon returned with what edmond wanted	136.84860166714614
now then do you wish for anything else said the patron	29.595077632443903
a piece of bread and another glass of the capital rum i tasted for i have not ea	80.37345346562604
he had not tasted food for forty hours	96.76013756185928
a piece of bread was brought and jacopo offered him the gourd	41.90739021076666
larboard your helm cried the captain to the steersman	55.495641878110916
dants glanced that way as he lifted the gourd to his mouth then paused with hand	96.87005650014756
hollo what s the matter at the chteau dif said the captain	23.249222849051023
a small white cloud which had attracted dants attention crowned the summit of th	82.622365660327
at the same moment the faint report of a gun was heard	19.938502365120147
the sailors looked at one another	85.52621825200839
what is this asked the captain	20.56466583343419
a prisoner has escaped from the chteau dif and they are firing the alarm gun rep	71.84396074424464
the captain glanced at him but he had lifted the rum to his lips and was drinkin	34.39869760905314

pretty strong rum said dants wiping his brow with his sleeve	51.75213724262683

under pretence of being fatigued dants asked to take the helm the steersman glad	147.11551434446824
dants could thus keep his eyes on marseilles	80.87503901972721
what is the day of the month asked he of jacopo who sat down beside him	31.20012365489404
the 28th of february	27.198397192382618
in what year	102.9700855723081
in what yearyou ask me in what year	80.31885882103232
yes replied the young man i ask you in what year	18.77265294535109
you have forgotten then	77.35803590694275
i got such a fright last night replied dants smiling that i have almost lost my 	104.37734375869597
i ask you what year is it	73.44661802444656
the year 1829 returned jacopo	425.2296903533104
it was fourteen years day for day since dants arrest	129.77154848008547
he was nineteen when he entered the chteau dif he was thirtythree when he escape	67.0220945915884
a sorrowful smile passed over his face he asked himself what had become of mercd	52.379356020793
then his eyes lighted up with hatred as he thought of the three men who had caus	42.07623609668146
he renewed against danglars fernand and villefort the oath of implacable vengean	63.56381082836742
this oath was no longer a vain menace for the fastest sailor in the mediterranea	64.26835351801523

the smugglers	3086.9646729608853

he had preserved a tolerably good remembrance of what the youth had been and was	101.71984569083105

as he had twenty times touched at leghorn he remembered a barber in st	78.99772842189545

the barber gazed in amazement at this man with the long thick and black hair and	86.5987681720058
at this period it was not the fashion to wear so large a beard and hair so long 	92.47209905338885

he had passed and repassed his island of monte cristo twenty times but not once 	109.93215841397506

as soon as his engagement with the patron of la jeune amlie ended he would hire 	78.83072993137792
then he would be free to make his researches not perhaps entirely at liberty for	72.50400597672729

where shall we pass the night he inquired	48.750160902431105
why on board the tartan replied the sailor	187.91971861564355
should we not do better in the grottos	29.126628997546227
what grottos	18440.20313750517
why the grottoscaves of the island	49.72792367393703
i do not know of any grottos replied jacopo	25.271925815080746
the cold sweat sprang forth on dants brow	76.5850063167248
what are there no grottos at monte cristo he asked	64.60498459700177
for a moment dants was speechless then he remembered that these caves might have	55.788902744374596
the point was then to discover the hidden entrance	149.94687818940824
it was useless to search at night and dants therefore delayed all investigation 	146.4948061570254

this sight reassured him	379.9735418307365
he then looked at the objects near him	92.13811735015173
he saw that he was on the highest point of the islanda statue on this vast pedes	45.81242749659112

then following the clew that in the hands of the abb faria had been so skilfully	46.941604475990495
it was this idea that had brought dants back to the circular rock	85.00591905824236
one thing only perplexed edmond and destroyed his theory	121.3807228313138
how could this rock which weighed several tons have been lifted to this spot wit	254.99149756525614
suddenly an idea flashed across his mind	88.10497281254001
instead of raising it thought he they have lowered it	215.54031410857914
and he sprang from the rock in order to inspect the base on which it had formerl	28.639820612333498
he soon perceived that a slope had been formed and the rock had slid along this 	93.94843491761547

but the rock was too heavy and too firmly wedged to be moved by anyone man were 	137.61467232022375
dants saw that he must attack the wedge	131.1745943017455
but how	79.05900205176957
he cast his eyes around and saw the horn full of powder which his friend jacopo 	38.60379515284369
he smiled the infernal invention would serve him for this purpose	106.25719894356247

this feeling lasted but for a moment	70.55230375412951
edmond inserted his lever in the ring and exerted all his strength the flagstone	89.40699040860187

he again struck it and with greater force	154.3645682550229

at the left of the opening was a dark and deep angle	93.15164920551311
but to dants eye there was no darkness	207.533212198494
he glanced around this second grotto it was like the first empty	73.80735285054247
the treasure if it existed was buried in this corner	189.03530992912297

i learned so much at marseilles replied the abb making a strong effort to appear	53.16925015372913
can you enlighten me on that point	42.37796453887083
i do not know who could if i could not said caderousse	35.536699063872334
why i lived almost on the same floor with the poor old man	57.764563737553544
ah yes about a year after the disappearance of his son the poor old man died	58.35018427263118
of what did he die	51.59937596458703
why the doctors called his complaint gastroenteritis i believe his acquaintances	415.8108719532353
caderousse paused	1892.0404141428642
of what asked the priest anxiously and eagerly	71.2614164855489
why of downright starvation	97.61780769903667
starvation exclaimed the abb springing from his seat	37.4200600778538
why the vilest animals are not suffered to die by such a death as that	78.770910280926
the very dogs that wander houseless and homeless in the streets find some pityin	116.2527695873881
oh it is impossibleutterly impossible	70.74469483027194
what i have said i have said answered caderousse	37.17343476873074
and you are a fool for having said anything about it said a voice from the top o	49.03921700715599
why should you meddle with what does not concern you	56.00565197854615
the two men turned quickly and saw the sickly countenance of la carconte peering	33.76324219319721
mind your own business wife replied caderousse sharply	142.43879128486134
this gentleman asks me for information which common politeness will not permit m	167.14507570541693
politeness you simpleton retorted la carconte	112.07285072021853
what have you to do with politeness i should like to know better study a little 	102.39164940721503
how do you know the motives that person may have for trying to extract all he ca	105.2478650413104
i pledge you my word madam said the abb that my intentions are good and that you	42.4465533416122
ah that s all very fine retorted the woman	52.27287750791581
nothing is easier than to begin with fair promises and assurances of nothing to 	140.22493265143223
nay nay my good woman make yourself perfectly easy i beg of you	107.73747851787776
whatever evils may befall you they will not be occasioned by my instrumentality 	140.0292233538933
la carconte muttered a few inarticulate words then let her head again drop upon 	66.90998173325892
again the abb had been obliged to swallow a draught of water to calm the emotion	81.13429674960477
when he had sufficiently recovered himself he said it appears then that the mise	45.00890895394905
surely had not such been the case he would not have perished by so dreadful a de	84.63555855445601
why he was not altogether forsaken continued caderousse for mercds the catalan a	55.63060511011152
and was he not so asked the abb	25.224412868521714
gaspard gaspard murmured the woman from her seat on the stairs mind what you are	72.45030005048564
caderousse made no reply to these words though evidently irritated and annoyed b	169.67824721443256
poor edmond he was cruelly deceived but it was fortunate that he never knew or h	49.236233728041796
and whatever people may say continued caderousse in his native language which wa	121.87863109859192
imbecile exclaimed la carconte	42.38277417016867
do you then know in what manner fernand injured dants inquired the abb of cadero	57.88146966869619
do i no one better	106.33312579409987
speak out then say what it was	79.75866853558524
gaspard cried la carconte do as you will you are masterbut if you take my advice	64.72703010496767
well wife replied caderousse i do nt know but what you re right	41.52245793956158
so you will say nothing asked the abb	27.574598592201514
why what good would it do asked caderousse	73.51455723403325
if the poor lad were living and came to me and begged that i would candidly tell	95.8179856433618
but you tell me he is no more and therefore can have nothing to do with hatred o	43.81991632646019
you prefer then said the abb that i should bestow on men you say are false and t	104.46816554580481
that is true enough returned caderousse	16.76640903028862
you say truly the gift of poor edmond was not meant for such traitors as fernand	83.34494320308512
remember chimed in la carconte those two could crush you at a single blow	204.82978506416947
how so inquired the abb	22.698356446216092
are these persons then so rich and powerful	174.01791084849472
do you not know their history	46.06599423151256
i do not	5.601976586273006
pray relate it to me	44.72622405787647
caderousse seemed to reflect for a few moments then said no truly it would take 	90.66869620740233
well my good friend returned the abb in a tone that indicated utter indifference	47.836994423545185
i shall do my duty as conscientiously as i can and fulfil my promise to the dyin	41.391315915266006
my first business will be to dispose of this diamond	138.22543465100165
so saying the abb again drew the small box from his pocket opened it and contriv	26.859046296921502
wife wife cried he in a hoarse voice come here	56.745703304316855
diamond exclaimed la carconte rising and descending to the chamber with a tolera	34.102820145506776
why did you not hear all we said inquired caderousse	33.131127915727895
it is a beautiful diamond left by poor edmond dants to be sold and the money div	71.22893892135468
the jewel is worth at least fifty thousand francs	58.21844964168092
oh what a magnificent jewel cried the astonished woman	108.9302406777108
the fifth part of the profits from this stone belongs to us then does it not ask	118.31247976803729
it does replied the abb with the addition of an equal division of that part inte	56.801606542586846
and why among us four inquired caderousse	145.11910196530192
as being the friends edmond esteemed most faithful and devoted to him	122.77703273976424
i do nt call those friends who betray and ruin you murmured the wife in her turn	144.90792452504746
of course not rejoined caderousse quickly no more do i and that was what i was o	84.74253279960844
i said i looked upon it as a sacrilegious profanation to reward treachery perhap	78.46687965101675
remember answered the abb calmly as he replaced the jewel and its case in the po	45.56165777297706
you will have the goodness to furnish me with the address of both fernand and da	32.33191771430774
the agitation of caderousse became extreme and large drops of perspiration rolle	68.35731714159091
as he saw the abb rise from his seat and go towards the door as though to ascert	39.72497698468679
0335 m	1.0316748620959284
there you see wife said the former this splendid diamond might all be ours if we	232.2780404631222
do you believe it	11.53162102679564
why surely a man of his holy profession would not deceive us	102.54644117898789
well replied la carconte do as you like	39.334170907803895
for my part i wash my hands of the affair	80.87920406314063
so saying she once more climbed the staircase leading to her chamber her body co	108.57683058007224
arrived at the top stair she turned round and called out in a warning tone to he	53.54183261350001
i have both reflected and decided answered he	363.04696413343163
la carconte then entered her chamber the flooring of which creaked beneath her h	41.791898028214305
well asked the abb as he returned to the apartment below what have you made up y	42.12531999267927
to tell you all i know was the reply	48.23223551206871
i certainly think you act wisely in so doing said the priest	189.4653108737877
not because i have the least desire to learn anything you may please to conceal 	73.63081959301554
i hope it may be so replied caderousse his face flushed with cupidity	29.22394237023071
i am all attention said the abb	59.58465367349067
stop a minute answered caderousse we might be interrupted in the most interestin	78.76948297977098
with these words he went stealthily to the door which he closed and by way of st	27.799748919500296
during this time the abb had chosen his place for listening at his ease	46.65941669778624
he removed his seat into a corner of the room where he himself would be in deep 	48.629432022557324
remember this is no affair of mine said the trembling voice of la carconte as th	35.778299720003176
enough enough replied caderousse say no more about it i will take all the conseq	42.62967478473384
and he began his story	77.28201191037256
chapter 27	1122.791104388608
the story	643.7140711868791
first sir said caderousse you must make me a promise	19.97376324791541
what is that inquired the abb	12.005322966639538
why if you ever make use of the details i am about to give you that you will nev	29.046788559679257
make yourself easy my friend replied the abb	27.560966871605924
i am a priest and confessions die in my breast	51.53897039578098
recollect our only desire is to carry out in a fitting manner the last wishes of	93.44429062728075
speak then without reserve as without hatred tell the truth the whole truth i do	269.8969188090653
this positive assurance seemed to give caderousse a little courage	231.64834569267683
well then under these circumstances said caderousse i will i even believe i ough	76.06351522884434
begin with his father if you please	57.03044798821307
said the abb edmond talked to me a great deal about the old man for whom he had 	29.649762828057508
the history is a sad one sir said caderousse shaking his head perhaps you know a	49.57066508600433
answered the abb edmond related to me everything until the moment when he was ar	47.71034763373724
at la rserve oh yes i can see it all before me this moment	66.81382491407365
was it not his betrothal feast	198.48022408409483
it was and the feast that began so gayly had a very sorrowful ending a police co	150.0107415026868
yes and up to this point i know all said the priest	55.9075149521252
dants himself only knew that which personally concerned him for he never beheld 	343.4484204318945
well when dants was arrested monsieur morrel hastened to obtain the particulars 	102.2350437923319
the old man returned alone to his home folded up his wedding suit with tears in 	117.87302912630231
the next day mercds came to implore the protection of m	32.09096492242782
de villefort she did not obtain it however and went to visit the old man when sh	41.607742441291144
no was the old mans reply i will not leave this house for my poor dear boy loves	55.014903549986556
but did you not go upstairs and try to console the poor old man asked the abb	46.68536617928088
ah sir replied caderousse we can not console those who will not be consoled and 	34.988339495511696
one night however i heard his sobs and i could not resist my desire to go up to 	59.62896472546138
i can not now repeat to you sir all the eloquent words and imploring language he	129.3277021840033
poor father murmured the priest	29.623399913542208
from day to day he lived on alone and more and more solitary	124.4977808674331
morrel and mercds came to see him but his door was closed and although i was cer	29.611501538078294
one day when contrary to his custom he had admitted mercds and the poor girl in 	42.96938111137961
however well disposed a person may be why you see we leave off after a time seei	212.560206540564
at length the poor old fellow reached the end of all he had he owed three quarte	90.59626462919707
i know this because the landlord came into my apartment when he left his	62.87922363285664
for the first three days i heard him walking about as usual but on the fourth i 	58.815542429177384
i then resolved to go up to him at all risks	75.04207483305925
the door was closed but i looked through the keyhole and saw him so pale and hag	36.13210504587565
morrel and then ran on to mercds	60.465399070955684
they both came immediately m	448.11252149467947
morrel bringing a doctor and the doctor said it was inflammation of the bowels a	114.03827283256113
i was there too and i never shall forget the old mans smile at this prescription	78.05392550867344
from that time he received all who came he had an excuse for not eating any more	127.42494237093285
the abb uttered a kind of groan	47.52504512360008
the story interests you does it not sir inquired caderousse	163.07047858331694
yes replied the abb it is very affecting	13.960499803851302
mercds came again and she found him so altered that she was even more anxious th	53.10662693904687
this was m	107.25605992300207
morrels wish also who would fain have conveyed the old man against his consent b	210.3398098826978
mercds remained therefore by his bedside and m	64.27950946236437
morrel went away making a sign to the catalan that he had left his purse on the 	26.836655507648043
the abb rose from his chair made two turns round the chamber and pressed his tre	71.99554020984198
and you believe he died	97.83734086059475
of hunger sir of hunger said caderousse	66.04023813764316
i am as certain of it as that we two are christians	56.57862025333068
the abb with a shaking hand seized a glass of water that was standing by him hal	58.149976483194955
this was indeed a horrid event said he in a hoarse voice	38.41436735686917
the more so sir as it was mens and not gods doing	258.9539280095233
tell me of those men said the abb and remember too he added in an almost menacin	37.16142756353243
tell me therefore who are these men who killed the son with despair and the fath	57.25191163420895
two men jealous of him sir one from love and the other from ambitionfernand and 	123.60246450200036
how was this jealousy manifested speak on	386.05940946694983
they denounced edmond as a bonapartist agent	68.82725451753123
which of the two denounced him which was the real delinquent	116.18975862106348
both sir one with a letter and the other put it in the post	92.92144824485997
and where was this letter written	74.35268392781417
at la rserve the day before the betrothal feast	56.9846984476092
twas so thentwas so then murmured the abb	106.21444427807836
oh faria faria how well did you judge men and things	171.92494410640393
what did you please to say sir asked caderousse	18.699483140659755
nothing nothing replied the priest go on	64.9739819306931
it was danglars who wrote the denunciation with his left hand that his writing m	58.98349347836539
but exclaimed the abb suddenly you were there yourself	129.85418444108052
i said caderousse astonished who told you i was there	59.81960136565923
the abb saw he had overshot the mark and he added quicklyno one but in order to 	51.934812108228805
true true said caderousse in a choking voice i was there	15.488639520869047
and did you not remonstrate against such infamy asked the abb if not you were an	79.06608964418513
sir replied caderousse they had made me drink to such an excess that i nearly lo	50.94125583189802
i had only an indistinct understanding of what was passing around me	123.04751380753883
i said all that a man in such a state could say but they both assured me that it	91.03584744672621
next daynext day sir you must have seen plain enough what they had been doing ye	194.3407897177258
yes sir i was there and very anxious to speak but danglars restrained me	64.96608199872318
if he should really be guilty said he and did really put in to the island of elb	63.20152617812308
i confess i had my fears in the state in which politics then were and i held my 	97.31163196822456
it was cowardly i confess but it was not criminal	65.35752043671673
0341 m	1.0068958995762132
i understandyou allowed matters to take their course that was all	372.0329798292064
yes sir answered caderousse and remorse preys on me night and day	122.53536439692229
i often ask pardon of god i swear to you because this action the only one with w	115.19269674542304
i am expiating a moment of selfishness and so i always say to la carconte when s	68.73496268052683
and caderousse bowed his head with every sign of real repentance	73.45554919695941
well sir said the abb you have spoken unreservedly and thus to accuse yourself i	50.12587940987895
unfortunately edmond is dead and has not pardoned me	36.00110879814587
he did not know said the abb	16.646029135397345
but he knows it all now interrupted caderousse they say the dead know everything	195.2421325704242
there was a brief silence the abb rose and paced up and down pensively and then 	26.15276387005584
you have two or three times mentioned a m	65.5040972281665
morrel he said who was he	55.0481509936304
the owner of the pharaon and patron of dants	36.41317460309143
and what part did he play in this sad drama inquired the abb	108.14409243851658
the part of an honest man full of courage and real regard	178.95694266854062
twenty times he interceded for edmond	80.30461285047198
when the emperor returned he wrote implored threatened and so energetically that	176.2091897512728
ten times as i told you he came to see dants father and offered to receive him i	51.85153419763167
i have the purse still by mea large one made of red silk	312.5814079351539
and asked the abb is m	91.53096951025013
morrel still alive	1254.91824558262
yes replied caderousse	5.483053659017061
in that case replied the abb he should be a man blessed of god rich happy	44.66997717069067
caderousse smiled bitterly	81.83987974511469
yes happy as myself said he	274.10678623035193

morrel is utterly ruined he has lost five ships in two years has suffered by the	81.59673006097933
if this ship founders like the others he is a ruined man	89.07736759982214

yes he has a wife who through everything has behaved like an angel he has a daug	73.61719820774073
if he were alone in the world he would blow out his brains and there would be an	30.0437426918117
horrible ejaculated the priest	144.51108926817307
and it is thus heaven recompenses virtue sir added caderousse	259.44373736442964
you see i who never did a bad action but that i have told you ofam in destitutio	59.88689927701179

because their deeds have brought them good fortune while honest men have been re	356.71134559160265
what has become of danglars the instigator and therefore the most guilty	72.03108068320743
what has become of him why he left marseilles and was taken on the recommendatio	30.443574628236416
morrel who did not know his crime as cashier into a spanish bank	80.61983883408458

ah said the abb in a peculiar tone he is happy	26.92409042056956
happy who can answer for that happiness or unhappiness is the secret known but t	112.60713577950006
and fernand	19.369927842000134
fernand why much the same story	168.5477681522333
but how could a poor catalan fisherboy without education or resources make a for	166.14290339653667
and it has staggered everybody	996.8759804301438
there must have been in his life some strange secret that no one knows	106.91639118409222
but then by what visible steps has he attained this high fortune or high positio	362.9048651238681

but i have seen things so extraordinary that what you tell me seems less astonis	104.91110422866683
mercds was at first in the deepest despair at the blow which deprived her of edm	54.66408294551839

in the midst of her despair a new affliction overtook her	66.58371992414867
this was the departure of fernandof fernand whose crime she did not know and who	33.40358326095138

caderousse paused	1136.5105932292224
and yet what asked the abb	27.937660156010796
yet i am sure she is not happy said caderousse	20.01488830410071
what makes you believe this	100.88307505137993
why when i found myself utterly destitute i thought my old friends would perhaps	134.40677015780426
so i went to danglars who would not even receive me	43.94569613052288
i called on fernand who sent me a hundred francs by his valetdechambre	68.74928701583966
then you did not see either of them	37.63096194443425
no but madame de morcerf saw me	27.561788264665598
how was that	32.487904885587554

and m	227.3319199406112
de villefort asked the abb	13.080787895070232
oh he never was a friend of mine i did not know him and i had nothing to ask of 	24.304886104758697
do you not know what became of him and the share he had in edmonds misfortunes	67.63193844714945
no i only know that some time after edmonds arrest he married mademoiselle de sa	72.1365002932422
i only as you see have remained poor wretched and forgotten	289.59509816163404
you are mistaken my friend replied the abb god may seem sometimes to forget for 	61.69276318069574
as he spoke the abb took the diamond from his pocket and giving it to caderousse	15.505912889408467
what for me only cried caderousse ah sir do not jest with me	112.91975319891186
this diamond was to have been shared among his friends	61.745207269180135
edmond had one friend only and thus it can not be divided	149.9910718510464
take the diamond then and sell it it is worth fifty thousand francs and i repeat	55.35451250251894

oh sir said caderousse putting out one hand timidly and with the other wiping aw	50.14672618465223
i know what happiness and what despair are and i never make a jest of such feeli	102.60352097092739

caderousse who touched the diamond withdrew his hand	77.3966295274072
the abb smiled	37.79671430117446
in exchange he continued give me the red silk purse that m	259.3702625962878
morrel left on old dants chimneypiece and which you tell me is still in your han	102.45299089808765
caderousse more and more astonished went toward a large oaken cupboard opened it	136.37671355043278
the abb took it and in return gave caderousse the diamond	116.04635188427068
oh you are a man of god sir cried caderousse for no one knew that edmond had giv	21.79050975384154
which said the abb to himself you would have done	30.716579010181334
the abb rose took his hat and gloves	51.7286990767661

when caderousse turned around he saw behind him la carconte paler and trembling 	48.36651730602605
is then all that i have heard really true she inquired	138.54923872018722
what that he has given the diamond to us only inquired caderousse half bewildere	49.462194937675555
the woman gazed at it a moment and then said in a gloomy voice suppose its false	78.84151883349968
caderousse started and turned pale	86.81127713336797
false he muttered	130.1701088821213
false why should that man give me a false diamond	128.44137373427768

to get your secret without paying for it you blockhead	295.21237907934193
caderousse remained for a moment aghast under the weight of such an idea	47.81189810153125

the day after that in which the scene we have just described had taken place on 	51.1447678224472
sir said he i am chief clerk of the house of thomson   french of rome	17.905834164649683
we are and have been these ten years connected with the house of morrel   son of	60.822497628549854
we have a hundred thousand francs or thereabouts loaned on their securities and 	42.44636106115594
i have come therefore express from rome to ask you for information	102.66366762876838
sir replied the mayor	41.037953260740785
i know very well that during the last four or five years misfortune has seemed t	66.25367811589166
he has lost four or five vessels and suffered by three or four bankruptcies but 	81.54810911148972

morrel and i shall say that he is a man honorable to the last degree and who has	34.22443665135356

oh sir exclaimed m	48.14408080643987
de boville your fears are unfortunately but too well founded and you see before 	120.55334153270816
i had two hundred thousand francs placed in the hands of morrel   son these two 	61.068004288943634
i had informed m	375.44376218408553
morrel of my desire to have these payments punctually and he has been here withi	102.82254778237268
but said the englishman this looks very much like a suspension of payment	80.46540949727301
it looks more like bankruptcy exclaimed m	874.4635318627476
de boville despairingly	92.82149798155781
the englishman appeared to reflect a moment and then said from which it would ap	81.11932593399379

well then i will buy it of you	38.39707962457172
yes i	11.85831012578339
but at a tremendous discount of course	150.35498393480705
no for two hundred thousand francs	23.30171369403258

a ray of joy passed across m	31.029391074718077

sir i ought to tell you that in all probability you will not realize six per cen	29.781723822203016
that s no affair of mine replied the englishman that is the affair of the house 	23.933225848844167
they have perhaps some motive to serve in hastening the ruin of a rival firm	153.49134780867138
but all i know sir is that i am ready to hand you over this sum in exchange for 	70.45380163754642

of course that is perfectly just cried m	97.70694085266065

sir replied the englishman laughing i am like my house and do not do such things	43.72003747477575

you are the inspector of prisons	67.44370301803329
i have been so these fourteen years	105.12598346222907
you keep the registers of entries and departures	141.50646021153761
i do	18.364351334092028
to these registers there are added notes relative to the prisoners	208.0738384357142
there are special reports on every prisoner	383.8760703360875
well sir i was educated at rome by a poor devil of an abb who disappeared sudden	198.26096339651664
i have since learned that he was confined in the chteau dif and i should like to	41.92661826737433
what was his name	18.832863084411354
the abb faria	17.69629242674314
oh i recollect him perfectly cried m	88.07855140009615
de boville he was crazy	39.7034075114876
so they said	54.6306506671591
oh he was decidedly	80.54529480080629
very possibly but what sort of madness was it	96.96424000835194
he pretended to know of an immense treasure and offered vast sums to the governm	69.6542103175627
poor deviland he is dead	52.32070677366974
yes sir five or six months ago last february	72.63903385692963
you have a good memory sir to recollect dates so well	145.6602694994178
i recollect this because the poor devils death was accompanied by a singular inc	81.8646248888018
may i ask what that was said the englishman with an expression of curiosity whic	22.812999833464644
oh dear yes sir the abbs dungeon was forty or fifty feet distant from that of on	125.57310844501824
indeed said the englishman	10.431096702699387
yes replied m	74.12697173450081
de boville i myself had occasion to see this man in 1816 or 1817 and we could on	82.81062366862194
that man made a deep impression on me i shall never forget his countenance	91.63923034985046
20025 m	1.0665600299453086
the englishman smiled imperceptibly	59.403574458954424
and you say sir he interposed that the two dungeons	60.014567597833604
were separated by a distance of fifty feet but it appears that this edmond dants	39.94130773218879
this dangerous mans name was	384.0816864622139
edmond dants	15.128262078952414
it appears sir that this edmond dants had procured tools or made them for they f	109.28094495089005
this tunnel was dug no doubt with an intention of escape	106.96065246587769
no doubt but unfortunately for the prisoners the abb faria had an attack of cata	44.93788317384121
that must have cut short the projects of escape	255.91359270522625
for the dead man yes replied m	93.40851763533699
de boville but not for the survivor on the contrary this dants saw a means of ac	30.840255965964005
he no doubt thought that prisoners who died in the chteau dif were interred in a	68.28053315567811
it was a bold step and one that showed some courage remarked the englishman	147.76499080149625
as i have already told you sir he was a very dangerous man and fortunately by hi	27.78305805892245
how was that	30.94192246668578
how do you not comprehend	26.42086889291216
the chteau dif has no cemetery and they simply throw the dead into the sea after	136.4773512770132
well observed the englishman as if he were slow of comprehension	49.34272603115545
well they fastened a thirtysixpound ball to his feet and threw him into the sea	87.47954803472471
really exclaimed the englishman	32.92665407584747
yes sir continued the inspector of prisons	43.77280263252791
you may imagine the amazement of the fugitive when he found himself flung headlo	76.25944330369877
that would have been difficult	44.96040970120646
no matter replied de boville in supreme goodhumor at the certainty of recovering	53.609058912321785
and he shouted with laughter	170.65340174876852
so can i said the englishman and he laughed too but he laughed as the english do	67.05265400202595
and so continued the englishman who first gained his composure he was drowned	104.37291423404574
so that the governor got rid of the dangerous and the crazy prisoner at the same	57.604450736185605
20027 m	1.0319380744453726
but some official document was drawn up as to this affair i suppose inquired the	228.14093836795118
yes yes the mortuary deposition	406.3781639686782
you understand dants relations if he had any might have some interest in knowing	173.78738426319677
so that now if there were anything to inherit from him they may do so with easy 	117.42905118534038
he is dead and no mistake about it	75.38213600586552
oh yes and they may have the fact attested whenever they please	172.58335493281032
so be it said the englishman	39.82165303556105
but to return to these registers	64.54777229035916
true this story has diverted our attention from them	209.84442136036304
excuse me	5.497002207142662
excuse you for what for the story by no means it really seems to me very curious	89.9283234646754
yes indeed	125.80810940538235

cocles appeared and the young man bade him conduct the stranger to m	47.96022669794752
morrels apartment	3602.3254325233684
cocles went first and the stranger followed him	52.8532919299957
on the staircase they met a beautiful girl of sixteen or seventeen who looked wi	75.67226584980176
morrel is in his room is he not mademoiselle julie said the cashier	42.05893487484821

the house of thomson   french had 300000 or 400000 francs to pay this month in f	29.27697152923446
morrel sighed deeply and passed his hand over his forehead which was covered wit	35.58774927743852
so then sir said morrel you hold bills of mine	85.44738206855928
yes and for a considerable sum	92.07987811574009
what is the amount asked morrel with a voice he strove to render firm	38.165556293723334
20035 m	1.0482769009687682
here is said the englishman taking a quantity of papers from his pocket an assig	20.613169471042152
de boville the inspector of prisons to whom they are due	25.524871989178802
you acknowledge of course that you owe this sum to him	85.91108566788431
yes he placed the money in my hands at four and a half per cent nearly five year	118.19344596241416
when are you to pay	39.31792219581146
half the 15th of this month half the 15th of next	64.19668294903772
just so and now here are 32500 francs payable shortly they are all signed by you	101.66611767250798
i recognize them said morrel whose face was suffused as he thought that for the 	58.81397190572407
is this all	169.46486293194528
no i have for the end of the month these bills which have been assigned to us by	38.04733865931042
it is impossible to describe what morrel suffered during this enumeration	87.31476824722196
two hundred and eightyseven thousand five hundred francs repeated he	95.45480389372618
yes sir replied the englishman	10.396656959211995
i will not continued he after a moments silence conceal from you that while your	210.0463427294112
at this almost brutal speech morrel turned deathly pale	99.97616737759795
sir said he up to this timeand it is now more than fourandtwenty years since i r	36.07029677913397
i know that replied the englishman	17.869967142589495
but as a man of honor should answer another tell me fairly shall you pay these w	235.64490917488558
morrel shuddered and looked at the man who spoke with more assurance than he had	40.029146795796564
to questions frankly put said he a straightforward answer should be given	512.0910813301871
yes i shall pay if as i hope my vessel arrives safely for its arrival will again	176.41718553586196
the poor mans eyes filled with tears	66.9925393818526
well said the other if this last resource fail you	80.15571772333071
well returned morrel it is a cruel thing to be forced to say but already used to	47.28331766781314
i fear i shall be forced to suspend payment	106.86939638043478
have you no friends who could assist you	63.79114426343385
morrel smiled mournfully	619.674272804365
in business sir said he one has no friends only correspondents	163.83804077782315
it is true murmured the englishman then you have but one hope	33.89008687502676
but one	74.64557855151328
the last	283.9246313421693

i am ruinedcompletely ruined	291.7647031121801
as i was on my way here a vessel was coming into port	138.21040775452337
i know it sir a young man who still adheres to my fallen fortunes passes a part 	98.35711904975919
and it is not yours	44.97455080923483
no she is a bordeaux vessel la gironde she comes from india also but she is not 	57.19087445421304
perhaps she has spoken to the pharaon and brings you some tidings of her	63.42599121587552
shall i tell you plainly one thing sir i dread almost as much to receive any tid	91.92146597171292
uncertainty is still hope	297.74618005540026
then in a low voice morrel addedthis delay is not natural	63.6516783776971
the pharaon left calcutta the 5th of february she ought to have been here a mont	39.68807550397381
what is that said the englishman	10.495633368456273
what is the meaning of that noise	31.653878586402136
oh my god cried morrel turning pale what is it	33.02526022036568
a loud noise was heard on the stairs of people moving hastily and halfstifled so	100.46303494301904
morrel rose and advanced to the door but his strength failed him and he sank int	35.7410165448095
the two men remained opposite one another morrel trembling in every limb the str	65.66399553933064

a key was inserted in the lock of the first door and the creaking of hinges was 	26.521741495122495
there are only two persons who have the key to that door murmured morrel cocles 	64.70536702524407
at this instant the second door opened and the young girl her eyes bathed with t	17.58127476898036
morrel rose tremblingly supporting himself by the arm of the chair	85.46506700571058
he would have spoken but his voice failed him	60.16198372370953
oh father said she clasping her hands forgive your child for being the bearer of	78.20495731602556

the young girl did not speak but she made an affirmative sign with her head as s	34.06049337871649

thanks my god said he at least thou strikest but me alone	103.60058577505694
a tear moistened the eye of the phlegmatic englishman	41.56104518847258
come in come in said morrel for i presume you are all at the door	44.18877268151019
scarcely had he uttered those words when madame morrel entered weeping bitterly	84.05063144514054
emmanuel followed her and in the antechamber were visible the rough faces of sev	64.22889418225044
at the sight of these men the englishman started and advanced a step then restra	29.532324543502032

morrel said he we were somewhere between cape blanc and cape boyador sailing wit	147.04047283592354
what do i think captain why i think that they are rising faster than they have a	52.78239472910204
that s my opinion too said the captain and ill take precautions accordingly	137.5624488796135
we are carrying too much canvas	73.91371556280988
avast there all hands take in the studdingsails and stow the flying jib	166.51948085151724

that was not enough for those latitudes said the englishman i should have taken 	46.410372687623834
his firm sonorous and unexpected voice made everyone start	840.4237837427991
penelon put his hand over his eyes and then stared at the man who thus criticize	24.024113976616277
we did better than that sir said the old sailor respectfully we put the helm up 	99.44678991922676
the vessel was very old to risk that said the englishman	86.25691502479344

penelon said the captain i think we are sinking give me the helm and go down int	39.569415282507194

he went into his cabin and came back with a brace of pistols	41.28645842644259
i will blow the brains out of the first man who leaves the pump said he	70.2979926370829
well done said the englishman	54.38329521974458

at another time added he i should have said give them besides two hundred francs	145.89800359618383
penelon turned to his companions and exchanged a few words with them	28.400539138540672
as for that m	74.22632656252782

he had at once declared for a military life and had in consequence studied hard 	158.739964163653
for a year he had held this rank and expected promotion on the first vacancy	119.17777470348486
in his regiment maximilian morrel was noted for his rigid observance not only of	69.19667287849687
we need hardly say that many of those who gave him this epithet repeated it beca	139.44027528487834
this was the young man whom his mother and sister called to their aid to sustain	72.62123262540274

a moment afterwards julie saw him go upstairs carrying two or three heavy ledger	87.20650134877246
morrel examined the ledgers opened the portfolio and counted the money	177.198387033165
all his funds amounted to 6000 or 8000 francs his bills receivable up to the 5th	92.55997629509135
he had not even the means for making a possible settlement on account	86.01089483180886
however when morrel went down to his dinner he appeared very calm	64.15029289078251
this calmness was more alarming to the two women than the deepest dejection woul	84.46179686590455
after dinner morrel usually went out and used to take his coffee at the club of 	59.57255131535194

night came the two women had watched hoping that when he left his room morrel wo	121.8173338636721
they listened he went into his sleepingroom and fastened the door inside	83.76240152648481
madame morrel sent her daughter to bed and half an hour after julie had retired 	43.62745878967296
in the passage she saw a retreating shadow it was julie who uneasy herself had a	79.73174649732316
the young lady went towards madame morrel	62.418400470164215
he is writing she said	77.11511025535991
they had understood each other without speaking	173.34303349725468
madame morrel looked again through the keyhole morrel was writing but madame mor	75.54096434043512
the terrible idea that he was writing his will flashed across her she shuddered 	132.61152535098446
next day m	134.04738533910086
morrel seemed as calm as ever went into his office as usual came to his breakfas	69.35238882132171
in the evening julie told her mother that although he was apparently so calm she	85.61031143154182
the next two days passed in much the same way	101.86288687576801
on the evening of the 4th of september m	21.469861311026694
morrel asked his daughter for the key of his study	56.790963089052106
julie trembled at this request which seemed to her of bad omen	131.8716083125501
why did her father ask for this key which she always kept and which was only tak	110.33421737301448
what have i done wrong father she said that you should take this key from me	81.84655317174597
nothing my dear replied the unhappy man the tears starting to his eyes at this s	44.88316783681607
julie made a pretence to feel for the key	93.32909090004614
i must have left it in my room she said	31.25161951804846
and she went out but instead of going to her apartment she hastened to consult e	82.45470302290717
do not give this key to your father said he and tomorrow morning if possible do 	81.95113551739911
she questioned emmanuel but he knew nothing or would not say what he knew	64.84290551574938
during the night between the 4th and 5th of september madame morrel remained lis	59.459771147791514
it was three oclock when he threw himself on the bed	20.49649012958382
the mother and daughter passed the night together	247.78981622076185
they had expected maximilian since the previous evening	91.06068093843082
at eight oclock in the morning morrel entered their chamber	15.180087428476648
he was calm but the agitation of the night was legible in his pale and careworn 	39.929301349569236
they did not dare to ask him how he had slept	40.36576694160865
morrel was kinder to his wife more affectionate to his daughter than he had ever	89.59412983060778
he could not cease gazing at and kissing the sweet girl	94.065789590963
julie mindful of emmanuels request was following her father when he quitted the 	188.24168361967062
remain with your mother dearest	147.64701769131614
julie wished to accompany him	54.64091530149772
i wish you to do so said he	16.980264433544956
this was the first time morrel had ever so spoken but he said it in a tone of pa	25.084520391408475
she remained at the same spot standing mute and motionless	52.268004770395926
an instant afterwards the door opened she felt two arms encircle her and a mouth	78.28827253333883
she looked up and uttered an exclamation of joy	37.39753972241577
20053 m	1.157247313873029
maximilian my dearest brother she cried	228.95960473269932
at these words madame morrel rose and threw herself into her sons arms	30.493734562390994
mother said the young man looking alternately at madame morrel and her daughter 	23.937716991105734
julie said madame morrel making a sign to the young man go and tell your father 	21.938221102941753
the young lady rushed out of the apartment but on the first step of the staircas	24.285655191991975
are you not mademoiselle julie morrel inquired the man with a strong italian acc	19.2090841658869
yes sir replied julie with hesitation what is your pleasure i do not know you	16.543847813547156
read this letter he said handing it to her	41.04205304971835
julie hesitated	340.25187931631086
it concerns the best interests of your father said the messenger	53.39591940001617
the young girl hastily took the letter from him	34.179840106064674
she opened it quickly and read	98.33653196010664

it is important that he should receive it before eleven oclock	43.598551931594976
you promised to obey me implicitly	175.95897875903805
remember your oath	261.99140327208846
sinbad the sailor	56.92793637526653
the young girl uttered a joyful cry raised her eyes looked round to question the	64.25441131025741
she cast her eyes again over the note to peruse it a second time and saw there w	60.455222178865746
she read	659.2099925923803
it is important that you should fulfil this mission in person and alone	80.16661151256534
if you go accompanied by any other person or should anyone else go in your place	122.06526893468225

was there nothing to fear was there not some snare laid for her her innocence ha	172.75197568631341
but there is no need to know danger in order to fear it indeed it may be observe	68.18832413060669
julie hesitated and resolved to take counsel	194.85829202554615
yet through a singular impulse it was neither to her mother nor her brother that	154.48599353801538
she hastened down and told him what had occurred on the day when the agent of th	58.88940435699118
you must go then mademoiselle said emmanuel	30.869144286539854
go there murmured julie	51.876685354347295
yes i will accompany you	25.720178238822715
but did you not read that i must be alone said julie	27.557063946323073
and you shall be alone replied the young man	14.522085430581361
i will await you at the corner of the rue du muse and if you are so long absent 	23.157368034907414
then emmanuel said the young girl with hesitation it is your opinion that i shou	18.718574421652978
did not the messenger say your fathers safety depended upon it	188.74942494806015
but what danger threatens him then emmanuel she asked	171.90879476517642
emmanuel hesitated a moment but his desire to make julie decide immediately made	175.40073139826853
listen he said today is the 5th of september is it not	26.011921065363985
today then at eleven oclock your father has nearly three hundred thousand francs	41.57520745518938
yes we know that	48.72160007545876
well then continued emmanuel we have not fifteen thousand francs in the house	20.381860988140502
what will happen then	82.45081068561973
why if today before eleven oclock your father has not found someone who will com	112.10663020565232
oh come then come cried she hastening away with the young man	107.49173280056918
during this time madame morrel had told her son everything	40.19808205608134
the young man knew quite well that after the succession of misfortunes which had	61.156066832577764
he was thunderstruck	55.04363635010134
then rushing hastily out of the apartment he ran upstairs expecting to find his 	73.7940154962517
while he was yet at the door of the study he heard the bedroom door open turned 	45.47557589595405
instead of going direct to his study m	56.28915244913669
morrel had returned to his bedchamber which he was only this moment quitting	94.6015212959905
morrel uttered a cry of surprise at the sight of his son of whose arrival he was	18.448011182165015
he remained motionless on the spot pressing with his left hand something he had 	74.44417635523664
maximilian sprang down the staircase and threw his arms round his fathers neck b	63.55396097586419
father he exclaimed turning pale as death what are you going to do with that bra	23.108309472725118
oh this is what i feared said morrel	28.463194501305317
father father in heavens name exclaimed the young man what are these weapons for	70.74685381996676
maximilian replied morrel looking fixedly at his son you are a man and a man of 	25.016052225186392
come and i will explain to you	23.78615342332194
and with a firm step morrel went up to his study while maximilian followed him t	33.81324419286739
morrel opened the door and closed it behind his son then crossing the anteroom w	49.94594708589107
in this ledger was made out an exact balancesheet of his affairs	89.20794764134651
morrel had to pay within half an hour 287500 francs	132.23184326677995
all he possessed was 15257 francs	443.47215262939693
read said morrel	12.32152546548787
the young man was overwhelmed as he read	28.102400708923074
morrel said not a word	66.84894310459279
what could he say what need he add to such a desperate proof in figures	192.24020740600048
and have you done all that is possible father to meet this disastrous result ask	184.8950841174911
i have replied morrel	26.602041952729497
you have no money coming in on which you can rely	81.35042360169417
you have exhausted every resource	417.795558347988
and in half an hour said maximilian in a gloomy voice our name is dishonored	42.02110761447967
blood washes out dishonor said morrel	109.37765030838443
you are right father i understand you	33.71299262128214
then extending his hand towards one of the pistols he said there is one for you 	46.710461426353675
morrel caught his hand	65.2192946804143
your motheryour sister who will support them	290.6859849810964
a shudder ran through the young mans frame	67.0988072019084
father he said do you reflect that you are bidding me to live	44.03045668281459
yes i do so bid you answered morrel it is your duty	30.679076804658155
you have a calm strong mind maximilian	154.66716743067295

the young man reflected for a moment then an expression of sublime resignation a	31.207429302830448

he took up the deadly weapon again his lips parted and his eyes fixed on the clo	57.3424001352083
at this moment of mortal anguish the cold sweat came forth upon his brow a pang 	64.54364806609648
he heard the door of the staircase creak on its hingesthe clock gave its warning	77.72345231729597

suddenly he heard a cryit was his daughters voice	133.2489980185433
he turned and saw julie	49.873230029206184

morrel passed his hand over his brow it seemed to him a dream	25.557523862917012
at this moment the clock struck eleven	13.069534221396037

emmanuel accompanied me father	388.87660447373173
he was to have waited for me at the corner of the rue du muse but strange to say	21.14753704708388
monsieur morrel exclaimed a voice on the stairs monsieur morrel	26.354426451012998
it is his voice said julie	24.681505812856738

they all went out and on the stairs met madame morrel who had been afraid to go 	41.58529940317005
in a moment they were at the canebire	16.722817928803018
there was a crowd on the pier	35.26339540357387
all the crowd gave way before morrel	156.7347583329718

one evening he cast off the painter of a sailboat from the iron ring that secure	97.09790830178154
the boat shot out of the harbor like a bird and the next morning franz disembark	49.89801641489877
he traversed the island after having followed the traces which the footsteps of 	96.11950768449032
two hours after he again landed at pianosa where he was assured that red partrid	66.53766720002292
the sport was bad franz only succeeded in killing a few partridges and like ever	286.94533987738754
ah if your excellency chose said the captain you might have capital sport	166.7649364453166
do you see that island continued the captain pointing to a conical pile rising f	77.5043580344179
well what is this island	38.252426674564155
the island of monte cristo	10.08165167498452
but i have no permission to shoot over this island	104.7478480603536
your excellency does not require a permit for the island is uninhabited	60.91340109285016
ah indeed said the young man	6.5533071805424745
a desert island in the midst of the mediterranean must be a curiosity	62.07084215213525
it is very natural this island is a mass of rocks and does not contain an acre o	36.12031363062654
to whom does this island belong	95.88416699454469

what game shall i find there	271.4660303811662
thousands of wild goats	173.60699083416662
who live upon the stones i suppose said franz with an incredulous smile	92.36822756386952
no but by browsing the shrubs and trees that grow out of the crevices of the roc	52.27394932186957
where can i sleep	131.92060193089938

as franz had sufficient time and his apartments at rome were not yet available h	108.94192825161151
upon his answer in the affirmative the sailors exchanged a few words together in	57.57756589611793
well asked he what now is there any difficulty in the way	64.29088193681656
replied the captain but we must warn your excellency that the island is an infec	33.736237922264294
what do you mean	3.9192732396121754
monte cristo although uninhabited yet serves occasionally as a refuge for the sm	196.11221095305552
the deuce that puts a different face on the matter	180.11643729615116

but who will say your excellency has been to monte cristo	41.69157191268601
oh i shall not cried franz	38.311661870142856
nor i nor i chorused the sailors	149.25962462390797
then steer for monte cristo	91.46966830592285
the captain gave his orders the helm was put up and the boat was soon sailing in	59.945982829399746
franz waited until all was in order and when the sail was filled and the four sa	56.51892073405656
gaetano said he to the captain you tell me monte cristo serves as a refuge for p	44.789866783323234
yes your excellency and it is true	21.841743223602677
i knew there were smugglers but i thought that since the capture of algiers and 	53.066757851545034
your excellency is mistaken there are pirates like the bandits who were believed	108.62644089216502
and who yet every day rob travellers at the gates of rome	91.90305855535891
has not your excellency heard that the french charg daffaires was robbed six mon	125.39264642170733
oh yes i heard that	27.149890274403145
well then if like us your excellency lived at leghorn you would hear from time t	87.50074105898452
now this rock it has met has been a long and narrow boat manned by six or eight 	124.6357031283707
but asked franz who lay wrapped in his cloak at the bottom of the boat why do no	54.05858877242426
why said gaetano with a smile	7.167198455472338
yes why	635.0955156222755
because in the first place they transfer from the vessel to their own boat whate	42.693968007639725
at the end of ten minutes the vessel begins to roll heavily and settle down	42.237070874232636
first one gunl goes under then the other	329.62511377476767
then they lift and sink again and both go under at once	196.16617571757453
all at once there s a noise like a cannonthats the air blowing up the deck	82.15180852069874
soon the water rushes out of the scupperholes like a whale spouting the vessel g	95.52041556145637
do you understand now said the captain why no complaints are made to the governm	36.33004803088327
it is probable that if gaetano had related this previous to proposing the expedi	50.91925322556077
he was one of those men who do not rashly court danger but if danger presents it	84.48793907632884
calm and resolute he treated any peril as he would an adversary in a duelcalcula	89.64771900100116
bah said he i have travelled through sicily and calabriai have sailed two months	54.57015718573961
i did not tell your excellency this to deter you from your project replied gaeta	63.15121769520959
yes and your conversation is most interesting and as i wish to enjoy it as long 	56.79678559642067
the wind blew strongly the boat made six or seven knots an hour and they were ra	90.13408794006752
as they drew near the island seemed to lift from the sea and the air was so clea	46.0085341507092
as for the sailors although they appeared perfectly tranquil yet it was evident 	141.83416291260912
they were within fifteen miles of monte cristo when the sun began to set behind 	47.67525719165054
little by little the shadow rose higher and seemed to drive before it the last r	91.52555764469136
fortunately the mariners were used to these latitudes and knew every rock in the	109.91098287953409
an hour had passed since the sun had set when franz fancied he saw at a quarter 	66.08474912204849
what is this light asked he	56.501890697062606
hush said the captain it is a fire	21.24601336610277
but you told me the island was uninhabited	68.41682947112535
i said there were no fixed habitations on it but i said also that it served some	127.30608866086467
and for pirates	436.8649795293474
and for pirates returned gaetano repeating franzs words	291.0257776275755
it is for that reason i have given orders to pass the island for as you see the 	37.23973466988455
but this fire continued franz	124.87121242510221
it seems to me rather reassuring than otherwise men who did not wish to be seen 	41.15695470409659
oh that goes for nothing said gaetano	56.31927583874441
if you can guess the position of the island in the darkness you will see that th	27.82738805674898
you think then this fire indicates the presence of unpleasant neighbors	148.16277783712653
that is what we must find out returned gaetano fixing his eyes on this terrestri	38.61342359303181
how can you find out	15.213457021131964
you shall see	29.388545288174562
gaetano consulted with his companions and after five minutes discussion a manuvr	126.58478769099244
the pilot again changed the course of the boat which rapidly approached the isla	113.53340932516808
gaetano lowered the sail and the boat came to rest	153.0696927432109
all this was done in silence and from the moment that their course was changed n	58.92864610255983
gaetano who had proposed the expedition had taken all the responsibility on hims	61.836988520397995
as for franz he examined his arms with the utmost coolness he had two doublebarr	26.373082137267474
during this time the captain had thrown off his vest and shirt and secured his t	34.50430335314043
this track soon disappeared it was evident that he had touched the shore	67.45042472267713
everyone on board remained motionless for half an hour when the same luminous tr	107.07572566662452
well exclaimed franz and the sailors in unison	61.991925740712844
they are spanish smugglers said he they have with them two corsican bandits	86.8053992647063
and what are these corsican bandits doing here with spanish smugglers	90.37746376746944
alas returned the captain with an accent of the most profound pity we ought alwa	33.9813036294449
very often the bandits are hard pressed by gendarmes or carbineers well they see	283.87589663205557
this costs us nothing and saves the life or at least the liberty of a fellowcrea	102.07235016031024
ah said franz then you are a smuggler occasionally gaetano	40.452938420182704
your excellency we must live somehow returned the other smiling impenetrably	111.58041274946875
then you know the men who are now on monte cristo	27.687189132509697
oh yes we sailors are like freemasons and recognize each other by signs	210.5087792721497
and do you think we have nothing to fear if we land	45.01828879033475
nothing at all smugglers are not thieves	172.63808922446896
but these two corsican bandits said franz calculating the chances of peril	117.98701425248987
it is not their fault that they are bandits but that of the authorities	65.44964640253961
how so	21.42704423448045
because they are pursued for having made a stiff as if it was not in a corsicans	57.56455363844013
what do you mean by having made a stiffhaving assassinated a man said franz cont	49.69283026628336
i mean that they have killed an enemy which is a very different thing returned t	53.9051622433188
well said the young man let us demand hospitality of these smugglers and bandits	41.80590971127079
do you think they will grant it	42.69108743786201
without doubt	3532.353692130089
how many are they	20.962534411506596
four and the two bandits make six	233.21506194636837
just our number so that if they prove troublesome we shall be able to hold them 	85.7835725543781
yes but your excellency will permit us to take all due precautions	38.593727440865884
by all means be as wise as nestor and as prudent as ulysses i do more than permi	38.920735575959185
silence then said gaetano	13.957943794007566
everyone obeyed	4994.612890093498
for a man who like franz viewed his position in its true light it was a grave on	101.14732345449183

the blaze illumined the sea for a hundred paces around	186.7497022975783
gaetano skirted the light carefully keeping the boat in the shadow then when the	136.86700467295393
at the first words of the song the men seated round the fire arose and approache	59.8890981523916
they soon appeared satisfied and returned with the exception of one who remained	130.19220765809598
when the boat was within twenty paces of the shore the man on the beach who carr	39.09948609292871
franz coolly cocked both barrels	1462.6719340974007
gaetano then exchanged a few words with this man which the traveller did not und	52.92482694234594
will your excellency give your name or remain incognito asked the captain	78.45228879744045
my name must rest unknown replied franz merely say i am a frenchman travelling f	154.99718622205717
as soon as gaetano had transmitted this answer the sentinel gave an order to one	58.196578303565815
not a word was spoken everyone seemed occupied franz with his disembarkment the 	185.16356448279467
the man who had disappeared returned suddenly on the opposite side to that by wh	106.90726584778243
the italian saccommodi is untranslatable it means at once come enter you are wel	170.166505354503
it is like that turkish phrase of molires that so astonished the bourgeois gentl	44.4347828435392
the sailors did not wait for a second invitation four strokes of the oar brought	91.72622863037341
one of his guns was swung over his shoulder gaetano had the other and a sailor h	45.18287121245684
the boat was moored to the shore and they advanced a few paces to find a comfort	50.55663902321557
not that way if you please	69.12804320583801
gaetano faltered an excuse and advanced to the opposite side while two sailors k	162.49337099020218
they advanced about thirty paces and then stopped at a small esplanade surrounde	69.8107561440789
around in the crevices of the rocks grew a few dwarf oaks and thick bushes of my	52.17416555107714
franz lowered a torch and saw by the mass of cinders that had accumulated that h	63.096406000991436
as for his suspicions once on terra firma once that he had seen the indifferent 	103.55509780339125
he mentioned this to gaetano who replied that nothing could be more easy than to	60.000661261772905
besides added he if the smell of their roast meat tempts you i will go and offer	70.13038815718438
you are a born diplomat returned franz go and try	63.70970650099521
meanwhile the sailors had collected dried sticks and branches with which they ma	152.17941351477856
franz waited impatiently inhaling the aroma of the roasted meat when the captain	146.21314585541234
well said franz anything newdo they refuse	325.9808155060512
on the contrary returned gaetano the chief who was told you were a young frenchm	23.288528522896893
well observed franz this chief is very polite and i see no objectionthe more so 	91.38792459734697
oh it is not that he has plenty and to spare for supper but he makes one conditi	57.41000447647459
his house has he built one here then	293.8472778336102
no but he has a very comfortable one all the same so they say	73.01460047399361
you know this chief then	94.63238124037876
i have heard talk of him	120.6575481197507
favorably or otherwise	742.8071383687507
the deuceand what is this condition	257.0287990183864
that you are blindfolded and do not take off the bandage until he himself bids y	121.14705963815496
franz looked at gaetano to see if possible what he thought of this proposal	67.61043150344756
ah replied he guessing franzs thought i know this is a serious matter	46.14683398048481
what should you do in my place	28.778393004538813
i who have nothing to losei should go	142.36857920316228
20075 m	1.068695543676439
you would accept	218.47759386785012
yes were it only out of curiosity	205.2016606344139
there is something very peculiar about this chief then	166.81193922151365
listen said gaetano lowering his voice i do not know if what they say is truehe 	43.49713459495495
what do they say	19.632197425200633
that this chief inhabits a cavern to which the pitti palace is nothing	125.82328778620841
what nonsense said franz reseating himself	129.67746328035042
it is no nonsense it is quite true	36.94016425552807
cama the pilot of the saint ferdinand went in once and he came back amazed vowin	93.06338772859033
do you know observed franz that with such stories you make me think of ali babas	41.10021824350635
i tell you what i have been told	15.970482552599586
then you advise me to accept	37.30672206989834
oh i do nt say that your excellency will do as you please i should be sorry to a	19.34699845164846
franz pondered the matter for a few moments concluded that a man so rich could n	71.72008842478284
gaetano departed with the reply	177.7665092565717
franz was prudent and wished to learn all he possibly could concerning his host	257.4142966711818
he turned towards the sailor who during this dialogue had sat gravely plucking t	230.57926199574922
never mind that returned the sailor i know their vessel	109.80453806684676
is it a very beautiful vessel	86.84013413384744
i would not wish for a better to sail round the world	123.25674562890346
of what burden is she	75.83383891405653
about a hundred tons but she is built to stand any weather	135.1062049503316
she is what the english call a yacht	120.91799757557891
where was she built	185.94926743221743
i know not but my own opinion is she is a genoese	36.05923909442553
and how did a leader of smugglers continued franz venture to build a vessel desi	107.62261786640089
i did not say that the owner was a smuggler replied the sailor	29.964995918158113
no but gaetano did i thought	72.11995705849287
gaetano had only seen the vessel from a distance he had not then spoken to anyon	46.657636816242075
and if this person be not a smuggler who is he	49.34846730578577
a wealthy signor who travels for his pleasure	375.807718370632
come thought franz he is still more mysterious since the two accounts do not agr	108.97460816713024
what is his name	10.057993879077609
if you ask him he says sinbad the sailor but i doubt if it be his real name	74.06662449968499
sinbad the sailor	59.70982696006928
and where does he reside	52.2870870595927
on the sea	45.253097378823774
what country does he come from	79.46329065091362
i do not know	5.073198981544589
have you ever seen him	9.065099063090093
what sort of a man is he	35.32208614467632
your excellency will judge for yourself	44.91971585861054
where will he receive me	92.89420257443768
no doubt in the subterranean palace gaetano told you of	104.76373262249538
have you never had the curiosity when you have landed and found this island dese	76.84110009854314
oh yes more than once but always in vain we examined the grotto all over but we 	200.20315354165515
decidedly muttered franz this is an arabian nights adventure	165.9130778141447
his excellency waits for you said a voice which he recognized as that of the sen	35.02170619252126
he was accompanied by two of the yachts crew	44.214033311187634
franz drew his handkerchief from his pocket and presented it to the man who had 	14.72227381156402
without uttering a word they bandaged his eyes with a care that showed their app	81.19188469455474
afterwards he was made to promise that he would not make the least attempt to ra	35.94371493038399
he promised	724.9049166649431
then his two guides took his arms and he went on guided by them and preceded by 	80.37774598575197
after going about thirty paces he smelt the appetizing odor of the kid that was 	86.61764136261003
presently by a change in the atmosphere he knew that they were entering a cave a	77.57671655706001
at length his feet touched on a thick and soft carpet and his guides let go thei	99.34578938372823
there was a moments silence and then a voice in excellent french although with a	40.2929793535237
welcome sir	63.18245243958204
i beg you will remove your bandage	97.13537213891111
it may be supposed then franz did not wait for a repetition of this permission b	40.917510604323866
although of a paleness that was almost livid this man had a remarkably handsome 	103.52804169115015
his pallor was so peculiar that it seemed to pertain to one who had been long en	39.20135001867538
he was not particularly tall but extremely well made and like the men of the sou	113.18254965574164
but what astonished franz who had treated gaetanos description as a fable was th	86.2575319845334
the entire chamber was lined with crimson brocade worked with flowers of gold	132.10315158948373
in a recess was a kind of divan surmounted with a stand of arabian swords in sil	41.229818677756484
the host gave franz time to recover from his surprise and moreover returned look	201.31427971449065
sir he said after a pause a thousand excuses for the precaution taken in your in	119.32419768611676
let me now endeavor to make you forget this temporary unpleasantness and offer y	148.1405955491785
ma foi my dear sir replied franz make no apologies	26.448921630092613
i have always observed that they bandage peoples eyes who penetrate enchanted pa	305.31542564509635
20079 m	1.0408297761917802
alas i may say with lucullus if i could have anticipated the honor of your visit	46.41976790421917
but such as is my hermitage it is at your disposal such as is my supper it is yo	79.2610586563539
ali is the supper ready	182.89938894130262
at this moment the tapestry moved aside and a nubian black as ebony and dressed 	71.76432111169673
now said the unknown to franz i do not know if you are of my opinion but i think	22.136605155605846
pray observe that i too much respect the laws of hospitality to ask your name or	141.60960040392294
i only request you to give me one by which i may have the pleasure of addressing	51.171613557788525
as for myself that i may put you at your ease i tell you that i am generally cal	28.762527184485673
and i replied franz will tell you as i only require his wonderful lamp to make m	112.98271477208829
that will keep us from going away from the east whither i am tempted to think i 	85.88036696268323
well then signor aladdin replied the singular amphitryon you heard our repast an	190.6667052477133
at these words moving aside the tapestry sinbad preceded his guest	137.62805940833857
franz now looked upon another scene of enchantment the table was splendidly cove	197.5510266803917
the diningroom was scarcely less striking than the room he had just left it was 	69.64770073348245
these baskets contained four pyramids of most splendid fruit there were sicily p	125.64498251540684
the supper consisted of a roast pheasant garnished with corsican blackbirds a bo	44.63411121324107
between these large dishes were smaller ones containing various dainties	281.15912325701174
the dishes were of silver and the plates of japanese china	93.21950044685033
franz rubbed his eyes in order to assure himself that this was not a dream	19.538364106450214
ali alone was present to wait at table and acquitted himself so admirably that t	71.24602516655595
yes replied he while he did the honors of the supper with much ease and graceyes	84.94181848087901
he remembers that i saved his life and as he has a regard for his head he feels 	87.51843365585549
ali approached his master took his hand and kissed it	39.09366957020601
would it be impertinent signor sinbad said franz to ask you the particulars of t	27.474109936946384
20081 m	1.1254929266259388
oh they are simple enough replied the host	52.768151219655806
it seems the fellow had been caught wandering nearer to the harem of the bey of 	85.87045740451798

this was a useless clause in the bargain for whenever the coward sees the first 	162.3356149972092
franz remained a moment silent and pensive hardly knowing what to think of the h	71.96108098968917
and like the celebrated sailor whose name you have assumed he said by way of cha	178.76564235227508
i made a vow at a time when i little thought i should ever be able to accomplish	88.25924874576961
although sinbad pronounced these words with much calmness his eyes gave forth gl	71.83621888276673
you have suffered a great deal sir said franz inquiringly	33.51891796754316
sinbad started and looked fixedly at him as he replied what makes you suppose so	120.63315616860226
everything answered franzyour voice your look your pallid complexion and even th	87.55662680489293
ii live the happiest life possible the real life of a pasha	286.02202029084054

ah if you had tasted my life you would not desire any other and would never retu	70.093044757454
revenge for instance observed franz	44.45251027095134
the unknown fixed on the young man one of those looks which penetrate into the d	73.49394809350211
and why revenge he asked	171.1880501901357
because replied franz you seem to me like a man who persecuted by society has a 	48.995567346167746
ah responded sinbad laughing with his singular laugh which displayed his white a	112.4027425355709
you have not guessed rightly	44.7624308371348
such as you see me i am a sort of philosopher and one day perhaps i shall go to 	29.319036326957004
and will that be the first time you ever took that journey	90.36285563030474
yes it will	40.967000868097635
i must seem to you by no means curious but i assure you that it is not my fault 	29.58918644521217
20083 m	1.2062571032215808
and do you propose to make this journey very shortly	75.48418098783125
i do not know it depends on circumstances which depend on certain arrangements	112.42697135405537
i should like to be there at the time you come and i will endeavor to repay you 	36.99235745860261
i should avail myself of your offer with pleasure replied the host but unfortuna	56.3927456261134
the supper appeared to have been supplied solely for franz for the unknown scarc	77.5804157913625
then ali brought on the dessert or rather took the baskets from the hands of the	66.37380571591602
between the two baskets he placed a small silver cup with a silver cover	53.38401763506132
the care with which ali placed this cup on the table roused franzs curiosity	193.78889746235836
he raised the cover and saw a kind of greenish paste something like preserved an	97.84354583713485
he replaced the lid as ignorant of what the cup contained as he was before he ha	109.25614377916074
you can not guess said he what there is in that small vase can you	79.32855076844997
no i really can not	92.85137878913358
well then that green preserve is nothing less than the ambrosia which hebe serve	178.9485801985731
but replied franz this ambrosia no doubt in passing through mortal hands has los	166.92277821751867
ah thus it is that our material origin is revealed cried sinbad we frequently pa	147.92890076784178
are you a man for the substantials and is gold your god taste this and the mines	109.13706199298075
are you a man of imaginationa poet taste this and the boundaries of possibility 	57.45365717018733
are you ambitious and do you seek after the greatnesses of the earth taste this 	94.64429478846817
is it not tempting what i offer you and is it not an easy thing since it is only	41.20199946528364
at these words he uncovered the small cup which contained the substance so laude	43.61469789710398
franz did not disturb him whilst he absorbed his favorite sweetmeat but when he 	46.487682435928306
what then is this precious stuff	147.5021278497948
did you ever hear he replied of the old man of the mountain who attempted to ass	55.71619309007125
of course i have	10.899177985398063
well you know he reigned over a rich valley which was overhung by the mountain w	63.89227289481253
in this valley were magnificent gardens planted by hassenbensabah and in these g	110.33148161128939
into these pavilions he admitted the elect and there says marco polo gave them t	104.00314100083976
what these happy persons took for reality was but a dream but it was a dream so 	168.62711185274287
then cried franz it is hashish i know thatby name at least	76.64967148253164
that is it precisely signor aladdin it is hashishthe purest and most unadulterat	75.01059253102704
do you know said franz i have a very great inclination to judge for myself of th	22.570094681307797
judge for yourself signor aladdinjudge but do not confine yourself to one trial	94.63107264658998
like everything else we must habituate the senses to a fresh impression gentle o	263.85730844491115
there is a struggle in nature against this divine substancein nature which is no	125.72253282042163
nature subdued must yield in the combat the dream must succeed to reality and th	262.55981327433443
but what changes occur it is only by comparing the pains of actual being with th	81.75492894962844
when you return to this mundane sphere from your visionary world you would seem 	162.64166335946823
franzs only reply was to take a teaspoonful of the marvellous preparation about 	103.88289900674087
diable he said after having swallowed the divine preserve	164.30933671699012
i do not know if the result will be as agreeable as you describe but the thing d	31.496511235784382

they both arose and while he who called himself sinbadand whom we have occasiona	116.49948898446345
it was simply yet richly furnished	403.4884325507571
it was round and a large divan completely encircled it	122.15691839662263
divan walls ceiling floor were all covered with magnificent skins as soft and do	266.5862019848137
both laid themselves down on the divan chibouques with jasmine tubes and amber m	81.59248916072718
each of them took one which ali lighted and then retired to prepare the coffee	112.90290117991434
there was a moments silence during which sinbad gave himself up to thoughts that	30.59518511982924
ali brought in the coffee	243.78074276137824
how do you take it inquired the unknown in the french or turkish style strong or	51.03762299219642
i will take it in the turkish style replied franz	22.625070577050913
and you are right said his host it shows you have a tendency for an oriental lif	38.726530067320965
ah those orientals they are the only men who know how to live	58.4212052997357
as for me he added with one of those singular smiles which did not escape the yo	17.77451862835603
20087 m	1.0446405393596636
ma foi said franz it would be the easiest thing in the world for i feel eagles w	20.242374763004975

he then said something in arabic to ali who made a sign of obedience and withdre	27.174168543568815
as to franz a strange transformation had taken place in him	58.70215199259165
all the bodily fatigue of the day all the preoccupation of mind which the events	82.4586741826263
his body seemed to acquire an airy lightness his perception brightened in a rema	76.90172770779853

then the three statues advanced towards him with looks of love and approached th	99.00666659341508
it seemed to franz that he closed his eyes and in a last look about him saw the 	36.04081142383403
lips of stone turned to flame breasts of ice became like heated lava so that to 	172.10244082455617

chapter 32	1801.273509347633
the waking	5479.417934781802
when franz returned to himself he seemed still to be in a dream	34.41137093395959
he thought himself in a sepulchre into which a ray of sunlight in pity scarcely 	110.95440153340387
he stretched forth his hand and touched stone he rose to his seat and found hims	69.71282395977136
the vision had fled and as if the statues had been but shadows from the tomb the	73.60687852693336
he advanced several paces towards the point whence the light came and to all the	130.97658891384407
he found that he was in a grotto went towards the opening and through a kind of 	51.160183187797244
the air and water were shining in the beams of the morning sun on the shore the 	47.286485549146256
there for some time he enjoyed the fresh breeze which played on his brow and lis	52.419233564458274
he was for some time without reflection or thought for the divine charm which is	125.46519494300955
he recalled his arrival on the island his presentation to a smuggler chief a sub	150.38294752374358
it seemed however even in the very face of open day that at least a year had ela	135.09544662766598
thus every now and then he saw in fancy amid the sailors seated on a rock or und	142.2154415019524
otherwise his head was perfectly clear and his body refreshed he was free from t	106.30291075081072

the signor sinbad has left his compliments for your excellency and desires us to	76.53725491120115
so then gaetano said franz this is then all reality there exists a man who has r	50.937442337309854
he exists as certainly as that you may see his small yacht with all her sails sp	158.167170591136
so saying gaetano pointed in a direction in which a small vessel was making sail	90.89353297085682
franz adjusted his telescope and directed it towards the yacht	156.26939091171087
gaetano was not mistaken	21.981121543537885
at the stern the mysterious stranger was standing up looking towards the shore a	131.16521229915975
he was attired as he had been on the previous evening and waved his pockethandke	38.28337452950446
franz returned the salute by shaking his handkerchief as an exchange of signals	135.73935788968205
after a second a slight cloud of smoke was seen at the stern of the vessel which	24.87817533963693
there do you hear observed gaetano he is bidding you adieu	100.66750756536658
the young man took his carbine and fired it in the air but without any idea that	46.84046182813978
what are your excellencys orders inquired gaetano	34.98863146218644
in the first place light me a torch	95.56292100457055
ah yes i understand replied the patron to find the entrance to the enchanted apa	36.2351008573271
with much pleasure your excellency if it would amuse you and i will get you the 	63.43718243475927
but i too have had the idea you have and two or three times the same fancy has c	68.67907061169524
giovanni light a torch he added and give it to his excellency	150.76125294881868
giovanni obeyed	265.5030730663034
franz took the lamp and entered the subterranean grotto followed by gaetano	35.52217150920117
he recognized the place where he had awaked by the bed of heather that was there	58.117599115033656
he saw nothing unless that by traces of smoke others had before him attempted th	201.3793742558052
yet he did not leave a foot of this granite wall as impenetrable as futurity wit	68.69898472785405
all was vain and he lost two hours in his attempts which were at last utterly us	154.2124244978458
at the end of this time he gave up his search and gaetano smiled	22.33061175903689
when franz appeared again on the shore the yacht only seemed like a small white 	100.6537799270901
he looked again through his glass but even then he could not distinguish anythin	62.237493246378264
gaetano reminded him that he had come for the purpose of shooting goats which he	42.66624931774249
he took his fowlingpiece and began to hunt over the island with the air of a man	24.504191741652757
these animals though wild and agile as chamois were too much like domestic goats	345.86312693301966
moreover other ideas much more enthralling occupied his mind	460.4714177129713
since the evening before he had really been the hero of one of the tales of the 	34.86149825928213
then in spite of the failure of his first search he began a second after having 	41.73969954933605
the second visit was a long one and when he returned the kid was roasted and the	80.29056083407264
franz was sitting on the spot where he was on the previous evening when his myst	27.59900660310427
why he remarked to gaetano you told me that signor sinbad was going to malaga wh	28.07374545305959
do nt you remember said the patron i told you that among the crew there were two	46.25041533373862
true and he is going to land them added franz	48.54173181274387
precisely so replied gaetano	25.083964200313737
ah he is one who fears neither god nor satan they say and would at any time run 	140.04972359339888
20093 m	1.2187587007779919
but such services as these might involve him with the authorities of the country	140.41843805768576
and what cares he for that replied gaetano with a laugh or any authorities he sm	82.3011934401359
let them try to pursue him why in the first place his yacht is not a ship but a 	50.23476301110398
it was perfectly clear that the signor sinbad franzs host had the honor of being	59.669524408057036
as to franz he had no longer any inducement to remain at monte cristo	20.526687997833445
he had lost all hope of detecting the secret of the grotto he consequently despa	58.6160298095352
at the moment the boat began her course they lost sight of the yacht as it disap	43.1083287480831
with it was effaced the last trace of the preceding night and then supper sinbad	63.15362676893336
the boat sailed on all day and all night and next morning when the sun rose they	154.376566623515
when franz had once again set foot on shore he forgot for the moment at least th	82.18554342833554
he set out and on the saturday evening reached the place de la douane by the mai	42.23667814206401
an apartment as we have said had been retained beforehand and thus he had but to	89.23649498078065
but this was not so easy a matter for the streets were thronged with people and 	73.11814720150913
all the rest of the year the city is in that state of dull apathy between life a	73.52991269648791
at last he made his way through the mob which was continually increasing and get	87.36628584290521
on his first inquiry he was told with the impertinence peculiar to hired hackney	82.2315643365661
then he sent his card to signor pastrini and asked for albert de morcerf	43.681486904855994
this plan succeeded and signor pastrini himself ran to him excusing himself for 	174.68650269526725
the apartment consisted of two small rooms and a parlor	96.46704712154273
the two rooms looked on to the streeta fact which signor pastrini commented upon	155.87057452536163
the rest of the floor was hired by a very rich gentleman who was supposed to be 	43.745468197289284
very good signor pastrini said franz but we must have some supper instantly and 	43.420926221231106
as to supper replied the landlord you shall be served immediately but as for the	71.94872911163996
what as to the carriage exclaimed albert	64.62501163769318
come come signor pastrini no joking we must have a carriage	84.37710176204072
sir replied the host we will do all in our power to procure you onethis is all i	40.55153108600509
and when shall we know inquired franz	53.888791291696336
tomorrow morning answered the innkeeper	155.63299048013576
oh the deuce then we shall pay the more that s all i see plainly enough	108.64555571229732
at drakes or aarons one pays twentyfive lire for common days and thirty or thirt	99.06749182401886
i am afraid if we offer them double that we shall not procure a carriage	108.60054541757845
then they must put horses to mine	244.50799989864367
it is a little worse for the journey but that s no matter	35.06940780261188
there are no horses	80.40285415441016
albert looked at franz like a man who hears a reply he does not understand	27.263086586519034
do you understand that my dear franzno horses he said but ca nt we have posthors	34.91461674859075
they have been all hired this fortnight and there are none left but those absolu	202.32841167338344
what are we to say to this asked franz	16.288512580717207
i say that when a thing completely surpasses my comprehension i am accustomed no	116.56227885169363
is supper ready signor pastrini	484.16995384119144
yes your excellency	16.126954543512593
well then let us sup	36.57010139242849
but the carriage and horses said franz	86.45943220199024
be easy my dear boy they will come in due season it is only a question of how mu	64.51518579455256

chapter 33	2259.144778038082
roman bandits	2735.998702067532
the next morning franz woke first and instantly rang the bell	106.58908083424572
the sound had not yet died away when signor pastrini himself entered	177.1514986375219
well excellency said the landlord triumphantly and without waiting for franz to 	105.06108777307527
yes returned franz for the very three days it is most needed	97.01779625803935
what is the matter said albert entering no carriage to be had	70.88634932935847
just so returned franz you have guessed it	44.74012083866092
well your eternal city is a nice sort of place	174.22124317521363
that is to say excellency replied pastrini who was desirous of keeping up the di	40.818592581877056
ah that is something said albert today is thursday and who knows what may arrive	47.78965195266632
ten or twelve thousand travellers will arrive replied franz which will make it s	91.74346320811783
my friend said morcerf let us enjoy the present without gloomy forebodings for t	39.458089612311106
at least we can have a window	63.49540861198542
in the corso	12.761769614072845
ah a window exclaimed signor pastriniutterly impossible there was only one left 	249.79840223836933
the two young men looked at each other with an air of stupefaction	7.193587110175167
well said franz to albert do you know what is the best thing we can do it is to 	15.712783864215371
ah the devil no cried albert i came to rome to see the carnival and i will thoug	25.915644245912368
bravo an excellent idea	119.71829819990941
we will disguise ourselves as monster pulchinellos or shepherds of the landes an	80.43510377694767
do your excellencies still wish for a carriage from now to sunday morning	127.52329151824568
parbleu said albert do you think we are going to run about on foot in the street	27.597072116817987
i hasten to comply with your excellencies wishes only i tell you beforehand the 	90.06861130757555
and as i am not a millionaire like the gentleman in the next apartments said fra	37.02313324603952
but excellencysaid pastrini still striving to gain his point	183.72760378863663
now go returned franz or i shall go myself and bargain with your affettatore who	115.48352335350405
do not give yourselves the trouble excellency returned signor pastrini with the 	96.39798125024882
and now we understand each other	41.61337741624847
when do you wish the carriage to be here	34.98161659411558
in an hour	19.761357884570593
in an hour it will be at the door	17.35966378087009
an hour after the vehicle was at the door it was a hack conveyance which was ele	29.029577379767314

the genius for laudation characteristic of the race was in that phrase	187.50082494110308
franz and albert descended the carriage approached the palace their excellencies	123.65929403343897
where do your excellencies wish to go asked he	22.546752656030957
to saint peters first and then to the colosseum returned albert	58.38995765490384
but albert did not know that it takes a day to see saint peters and a month to s	33.27389447886557
the day was passed at saint peters alone	51.42869451355275
suddenly the daylight began to fade away franz took out his watchit was halfpast	113.78781276636306
they returned to the hotel at the door franz ordered the coachman to be ready at	26.20055120523705
he wished to show albert the colosseum by moonlight as he had shown him saint pe	54.34669159359335

he was to leave the city by the porta del popolo skirt the outer wall and reente	26.542508936546962
they sat down to dinner	49.404856681769154
signor pastrini had promised them a banquet he gave them a tolerable repast	114.10392559065771
at the end of the dinner he entered in person	19.110104890435956
franz thought that he came to hear his dinner praised and began accordingly but 	185.4642690193903
excellency said pastrini i am delighted to have your approbation but it was not 	20.469899072059633
did you come to tell us you have procured a carriage asked albert lighting his c	53.315052405407485

it is much more convenient at pariswhen anything can not be done you pay double 	152.56864005517184
that is what all the french say returned signor pastrini somewhat piqued for tha	71.09914271170285

it is of course understood that albert resided in the aforesaid street appeared 	80.34908243003916
signor pastrini remained silent a short time it was evident that he was musing o	32.68818110312419
but said franz in his turn interrupting his hosts meditations you had some motiv	30.587410212922915
20099 m	1.1200207478371569
ah yes you have ordered your carriage at eight oclock precisely	58.20393259532606

you intend visiting il colosseo	693.9992862213888
you mean the colosseum	43.686465309033785
it is the same thing	7.726340195815346
you have told your coachman to leave the city by the porta del popolo to drive r	32.71058721064282
these are my words exactly	106.11410935672309
well this route is impossible	302.4750937934645
very dangerous to say the least	81.32998336321376
dangerousand why	1815.6209611675263
on account of the famous luigi vampa	20.07630630561897
pray who may this famous luigi vampa be inquired albert he may be very famous at	100.6952085346947
what do you not know him	16.258435615552468
i have not that honor	86.17321395900596
you have never heard his name	33.326667697513365
well then he is a bandit compared to whom the decesaris and the gasparones were 	34.95403786675527
now then albert cried franz here is a bandit for you at last	41.2708201329305
i forewarn you signor pastrini that i shall not believe one word of what you are	46.528887073179995
once upon a time well go on	335.61100895780737
signor pastrini turned toward franz who seemed to him the more reasonable of the	37.0515317730693
excellency said he gravely addressing franz if you look upon me as a liar it is 	39.09268159303234
albert does not say you are a liar signor pastrini said franz but that he will n	28.23293344216063
but if your excellency doubt my veracity	80.97776216495073
signor pastrini returned franz you are more susceptible than cassandra who was a	23.38714779990926

this replied signor pastrini that you will go out by one but i very much doubt y	72.76091966130187
why asked franz	15.89473421739111
because after nightfall you are not safe fifty yards from the gates	142.27241634149516

do you know signor pastrini said albert lighting a second cigar at the first tha	24.696492373144377
doubtless signor pastrini found this pleasantry compromising for he only answere	222.15464051311525
your excellency knows that it is not customary to defend yourself when attacked 	77.18920332626486
what cried albert whose courage revolted at the idea of being plundered tamely n	72.52368045742178
no for it would be useless	27.915421748434365
what could you do against a dozen bandits who spring out of some pit ruin or aqu	143.05800254399475

my dear albert returned franz your answer is sublime and worthy the let him die 	106.67623158086111
albert poured himself out a glass of lacryma christi which he sipped at interval	92.98984126233528

your excellencies permit it asked the host	78.79070736098036

the host sat down after having made each of them a respectful bow which meant th	110.63234765463731

why should an exception be made in her favor	136.22943632028756
i thought that my entreaties	77.38039277166375

all savage natures appreciate a desperate deed	743.8811341215677
no other of the bandits would perhaps have done the same but they all understood	137.15282952967655

the young peasant girl at first timid and scared soon recovered herself	209.102079571046

twice or thrice during the dance the young girl had glanced at luigi and each ti	80.05941990769092
thus it was almost tremblingly that she resumed her lovers arm	120.89199652584111
the quadrille had been most perfect and it was evident there was a great demand 	82.13668912069565
one of the cavaliers then hastened to invite teresa without whom it was impossib	51.239113293950815
the truth was that luigi had not felt the strength to support another such trial	80.65559831982885
teresa had yielded in spite of herself but when she looked at the agitated count	89.67217382784781
she herself was not exempt from internal emotion and without having done anythin	203.87756962065376
why she did not know but yet she did not the less feel that these reproaches wer	60.596467711250895

and what said your cavalier to you	102.2897065539436
he said it only depended on myself to have it and i had only one word to say	69.45017894809753
he was right said luigi	25.546156128807645
do you desire it as ardently as you say	25.22308983011163
well then you shall have it	17.286403589539376
the young girl much astonished raised her head to look at him but his face was s	45.25692769952581
as luigi spoke thus he left her	73.51886906060305

she then returned to her room calling for help as loudly as she could when sudde	74.8919729671989
when she recovered her father was by her side	83.17244312088705
all the servants surrounded her offering her assistance	434.3199568845051

the next day at the usual hour the two young peasants were on the borders of the	15.569459331444971

the young girl was very pensive but seeing luigi so cheerful she on her part ass	107.22031645145165
luigi took her arm beneath his own and led her to the door of the grotto	31.10363714491571
then he paused	73.03385630192814
the young girl perceiving that there was something extraordinary looked at him s	106.45645767931828
teresa said luigi yesterday evening you told me you would give all the world to 	60.42147483758371
yes replied teresa with astonishment but i was mad to utter such a wish	44.17891262450154
and i replied very well you shall have it	51.29474010605627
yes replied the young girl whose astonishment increased at every word uttered by	70.51228117790114
i have promised no more than i have given you teresa said luigi proudly	33.53854292341036
go into the grotto and dress yourself	59.499988769865766
at these words he drew away the stone and showed teresa the grotto lighted up by	52.92423388735291
teresa uttered a cry of joy and without inquiring whence this attire came or eve	102.71944121008654
luigi pushed the stone behind her for on the crest of a small adjacent hill whic	59.149836926110616
when he saw luigi he put his horse into a gallop and advanced toward him	33.1492454499293
luigi was not mistaken	21.334121539330738
the traveller who was going from palestrina to tivoli had mistaken his way the y	59.255699697151144
luigi threw his cloak on the ground placed his carbine on his shoulder and freed	33.306189985156564
in ten minutes luigi and the traveller reached the crossroads	48.25312305484343
on arriving there with an air as majestic as that of an emperor he stretched his	57.96319581641992
that is your road excellency and now you can not again mistake	117.05677492587746
and here is your recompense said the traveller offering the young herdsman some 	89.84071706090826
thank you said luigi drawing back his hand i render a service i do not sell it	29.693800362419733
well replied the traveller who seemed used to this difference between the servil	95.3202158453262
ah yes that is another thing	32.3678825773322
then said the traveller take these two venetian sequins and give them to your br	49.08485987428924
and then do you take this poniard said the young herdsman you will not find one 	31.145229843912933
i accept it answered the traveller but then the obligation will be on my side fo	55.768688718737906
for a dealer perhaps but for me who engraved it myself it is hardly worth a pias	136.4472237331546
what is your name inquired the traveller	22.84659431830082
luigi vampa replied the shepherd with the same air as he would have replied alex	34.82872429872475
and yours	4419.532902773321
i said the traveller am called sinbad the sailor	82.28153441058987
franz dpinay started with surprise	136.72565220191328
sinbad the sailor he said	70.4960095837521
yes replied the narrator that was the name which the traveller gave to vampa as 	53.353632438674644
well and what may you have to say against this name inquired albert it is a very	29.75662697705813
franz said no more	72.49042021629431
the name of sinbad the sailor as may well be supposed awakened in him a world of	100.53927993327967

as he came within two or three hundred paces of the grotto he thought he heard a	45.85548249914036
he listened to know whence this sound could proceed	286.46862335204304
a moment afterwards he thought he heard his own name pronounced distinctly	73.60182451720253
the cry proceeded from the grotto	181.78706628795516
he bounded like a chamois cocking his carbine as he went and in a moment reached	94.82159557606161
three cries for help came more distinctly to his ear	198.08529476456383
he cast his eyes around him and saw a man carrying off teresa as nessus the cent	53.86025039849497
this man who was hastening towards the wood was already threequarters of the way	99.70979605527059
vampa measured the distance the man was at least two hundred paces in advance of	56.55776949280317
the young shepherd stopped as if his feet had been rooted to the ground then he 	34.0759829877425
the ravisher stopped suddenly his knees bent under him and he fell with teresa i	137.6190032944662
the young girl rose instantly but the man lay on the earth struggling in the ago	89.2451758634309
vampa then rushed towards teresa for at ten paces from the dying man her legs ha	106.8183473589157
fortunately she was unscathed and it was fright alone that had overcome teresa	125.65313083832385
when luigi had assured himself that she was safe and unharmed he turned towards 	57.00184682539121
he had just expired with clenched hands his mouth in a spasm of agony and his ha	69.29209573720263
his eyes remained open and menacing	163.72284829500234
vampa approached the corpse and recognized cucumetto	101.56116813572427
from the day on which the bandit had been saved by the two young peasants he had	23.930487065225517
from that time he had watched them and profiting by the moment when her lover ha	70.06507531486153
vampa gazed on him for a moment without betraying the slightest emotion while on	63.380913632761555
suddenly vampa turned toward his mistress	57.03017604649393
ah said hegood good you are dressed it is now my turn to dress myself	126.30948223379883
20125 m	1.1258106254521705
teresa was clothed from head to foot in the garb of the count of sanfelices daug	32.60028782759845
vampa took cucumettos body in his arms and conveyed it to the grotto while in he	47.401834778335896
if a second traveller had passed he would have seen a strange thinga shepherdess	77.24936887797863
he would no doubt have believed that he had returned to the times of florian and	38.165174121773305
at the end of a quarter of an hour vampa quitted the grotto his costume was no l	15.702795872365655
he wore a vest of garnetcolored velvet with buttons of cut gold a silk waistcoat	88.95575866841678
teresa uttered a cry of admiration	15.84886678384779
vampa in this attire resembled a painting by lopold robert or schnetz	67.38391256208637
he had assumed the entire costume of cucumetto	47.089658108953664
the young man saw the effect produced on his betrothed and a smile of pride pass	73.62734379389069
now he said to teresa are you ready to share my fortune whatever it may be	35.117191130260196
oh yes exclaimed the young girl enthusiastically	15.29659686931625
and follow me wherever i go	151.08697195622912
to the worlds end	120.96522885875055
then take my arm and let us on we have no time to lose	46.912201767610384
the young girl did so without questioning her lover as to where he was conductin	61.97055750548256
they went towards the forest and soon entered it	64.74663187315804
we need scarcely say that all the paths of the mountain were known to vampa he t	56.78408517504687
at the end of this time they had reached the thickest part of the forest	16.785611648135262
a torrent whose bed was dry led into a deep gorge	316.11961857803215
vampa took this wild road which enclosed between two ridges and shadowed by the 	99.41393334040822
teresa had become alarmed at the wild and deserted look of the plain around her 	151.5014314924678
suddenly about ten paces from them a man advanced from behind a tree and aimed a	95.13449742092031
not another step he said or you are a dead man	42.98216839777994
what then said vampa raising his hand with a gesture of disdain while teresa no 	25.642325782433325
who are you inquired the sentinel	34.621812415591904
i am luigi vampa shepherd of the sanfelice farm	65.96995740958756
what do you want	4.964121732530179
i would speak with your companions who are in the glade at rocca bianca	55.77411386954006
follow me then said the sentinel or as you know your way go first	63.808606578164934
vampa smiled disdainfully at this precaution on the part of the bandit went befo	46.30259122772048
at the end of ten minutes the bandit made them a sign to stop	21.28328209661459
the two young persons obeyed	78.72374791863996
then the bandit thrice imitated the cry of a crow a croak answered this signal	191.19019515254485
good said the sentry you may now go on	70.24481541727755
luigi and teresa again set forward as they went on teresa clung tremblingly to h	55.43185129830369
the retreat of rocca bianca was at the top of a small mountain which no doubt in	29.883170876711038

i wish to say that i am tired of a shepherds life was vampas reply	41.881809788540295
ah i understand said the lieutenant and you seek admittance into our ranks	83.49649771965734
welcome cried several bandits from ferrusino pampinara and anagni who had recogn	75.56600290255955
yes but i came to ask something more than to be your companion	47.99902857975699
and what may that be inquired the bandits with astonishment	74.52540399073638
i come to ask to be your captain said the young man	21.486006998893266
the bandits shouted with laughter	351.96243000123155
and what have you done to aspire to this honor demanded the lieutenant	57.16671768705211
i have killed your chief cucumetto whose dress i now wear and i set fire to the 	173.03524667245122

i say he is a myth replied albert and never had an existence	56.68163800457065
and what may a myth be inquired pastrini	64.4929478071129
the explanation would be too long my dear landlord replied franz	74.7181895733217
and you say that signor vampa exercises his profession at this moment in the env	33.46171549229957
and with a boldness of which no bandit before him ever gave an example	241.4214429619194
then the police have vainly tried to lay hands on him	140.17813534113415
why you see he has a good understanding with the shepherds in the plains the fis	42.94033696589269
they seek for him in the mountains and he is on the waters they follow him on th	62.22915452606335
and how does he behave towards travellers	251.20191001209116
alas his plan is very simple	147.23292235983627
it depends on the distance he may be from the city whether he gives eight hours 	161.06278564778435
at the sixtieth minute of this hour if the money is not forthcoming he blows out	97.77927576074961

the clock struck nine as the door opened and a coachman appeared	67.27802729813538
excellencies said he the coach is ready	52.57832049412243

franz had so managed his route that during the ride to the colosseum they passed	123.46021055609418
the road selected was a continuation of the via sistina then by cutting off the 	91.44677270011397
this itinerary possessed another great advantagethat of leaving franz at full li	246.789293126072
seated with folded arms in a corner of the carriage he continued to ponder over 	50.61640011237522

the very name assumed by his host of monte cristo and again repeated by the land	146.38747963679342

thus then the young men made no attempt at resistance but blindly and confidingl	76.12799417362922

perhaps i am but one thing i have resolved on and that is to stop at nothing to 	65.94467088771123
i should hate and despise myself as a coward did i desert the brave fellow in hi	182.10946522644474
and what do you mean to do	7.791854474122137
to surround the scaffold with twenty of my best men who at a signal from me will	134.75131097990985
that seems to me as hazardous as uncertain and convinces me that my scheme is fa	38.96602695025857
and what is your excellencys project	45.53619175387403
just this	195.0265419916348
i will so advantageously bestow 2000 piastres that the person receiving them sha	257.34225561401985
and do you feel sure of succeeding	77.77784045587536
pardieu exclaimed the man in the cloak suddenly expressing himself in french	70.98491462091476
what did your excellency say inquired the other	35.70363602214075
i said my good fellow that i would do more singlehanded by the means of gold tha	50.91667959025055
leave me then to act and have no fears for the result	74.79368866236891
at least there can be no harm in myself and party being in readiness in case you	117.09345245285921
none whatever	4084.7460511165364
take what precautions you please if it is any satisfaction to you to do so but r	45.7653100868214
remember the execution is fixed for the day after tomorrow and that you have but	56.493081284162876
and what of that is not a day divided into twentyfour hours each hour into sixty	150.99787995169729
and how shall i know whether your excellency has succeeded or not	63.708795132851904
oh that is very easily arranged	104.5563242249276
i have engaged the three lower windows at the caf rospoli should i have obtained	52.1577109651093
and whom will you employ to carry the reprieve to the officer directing the exec	48.86720475443559

his dress will procure him the means of approaching the scaffold itself and he w	103.26042942589636
your excellency said the man you are fully persuaded of my entire devotion to yo	63.91604095827579
nay i flatter myself that there can be no doubt of it replied the cavalier in th	40.402007743838695
well then only fulfil your promise of rescuing peppino and henceforward you shal	116.39171382262985
have a care how far you pledge yourself my good friend for i may remind you of y	78.72142057173194
let that day come sooner or later your excellency will find me what i have found	111.34214641203478
hush interrupted the stranger i hear a noise	102.48450618276304
tis some travellers who are visiting the colosseum by torchlight	193.55359059424416
twere better we should not be seen together those guides are nothing but spies a	269.2576674574454
well then if you obtain the reprieve	46.83049019043343
the middle window at the caf rospoli will be hung with white damask bearing a re	88.22457727923458
and if you fail	50.996875403150256
then all three windows will have yellow draperies	175.03478105546904
and then	31.7434506162
and then my good fellow use your daggers in any way you please and i further pro	109.5715268207507
we understand each other perfectly then	136.92294672796123
adieu your excellency depend upon me as firmly as i do upon you	59.57130144659628
saying these words the transteverin disappeared down the staircase while his com	69.59591144377427
the next minute franz heard himself called by albert who made the lofty building	71.05318549202384
franz however did not obey the summons till he had satisfied himself that the tw	63.756294771957506
in ten minutes after the strangers had departed franz was on the road to the pia	26.04679191216856
franz let him proceed without interruption and in fact did not hear what was sai	77.55877777283868
one of the two men whose mysterious meeting in the colosseum he had so unintenti	35.88280211627073
it was more especially when this man was speaking in a manner half jesting half 	60.133073702988185
and the more he thought the more entire was his conviction that the person who w	101.36232339694104
20139 m	1.1120575635997552
under any other circumstances franz would have found it impossible to resist his	38.88236551466687
as we have seen therefore he permitted his former host to retire without attempt	145.42923313419845
in vain did franz endeavor to forget the many perplexing thoughts which assailed	140.35076111894452
slumber refused to visit his eyelids and the night was passed in feverish contem	87.76981221021975
worn out at length he fell asleep at daybreak and did not awake till late	116.44017531618944
like a genuine frenchman albert had employed his time in arranging for the eveni	65.1556350518152
at five oclock albert returned delighted with his days work he had been occupied	50.89426290231555
yes in a single day he had accomplished what his more seriousminded companion wo	166.12143532086375
neither had he neglected to ascertain the name of the piece to be played that ni	48.70463185815551
the opera of parisina was announced for representation and the principal actors 	97.89207952620603
the young men therefore had reason to consider themselves fortunate in having th	182.37094397551508
albert had never been able to endure the italian theatres with their orchestras 	48.63003492261906
still in spite of this albert displayed his most dazzling and effective costumes	64.46266357524117
sometimes albert would affect to make a joke of his want of success but internal	208.45458564266957
and the thing was so much the more annoying as according to the characteristic m	74.85616312183855
alas poor albert none of those interesting adventures fell in his way the lovely	255.76598007011862
yet he could not restrain a hope that in italy as elsewhere there might be an ex	48.407632953672596
albert besides being an elegant welllooking young man was also possessed of cons	115.08300254767617
it was therefore no small mortification to him to have visited most of the princ	77.0250730510586
albert however hoped to indemnify himself for all these slights and indifference	131.86613775440637
the carnival was to commence on the morrow therefore albert had not an instant t	44.204473252457895
with this design he had engaged a box in the most conspicuous part of the theatr	33.36995215513766
the box taken by albert was in the first circle although each of the three tiers	112.89832518727323
another motive had influenced alberts selection of his seatwho knew but that thu	141.02052793702154
these united considerations made albert more lively and anxious to please than h	133.2751782764074
totally disregarding the business of the stage he leaned from his box and began 	81.12977039771151
the truth was that the anticipated pleasures of the carnival with the holy week 	65.39355698573016
the actors made their entries and exits unobserved or unthought of at certain co	142.5375813652263
towards the close of the first act the door of a box which had been hitherto vac	35.61801037891
the quick eye of albert caught the involuntary start with which his friend behel	56.41079180802406
do you know the woman who has just entered that box	59.000005470207334
yes what do you think of her	20.279536467987153
oh she is perfectly lovelywhat a complexion and such magnificent hair is she fre	87.22359376001883
no a venetian	123.3833497278585
and her name is	58.21675626238375
countess g	5.363304045876246
ah i know her by name exclaimed albert she is said to possess as much wit and cl	70.71579095620083
i was to have been presented to her when i met her at madame villeforts ball	71.83203999454639
shall i assist you in repairing your negligence asked franz	72.13151284791225
my dear fellow are you really on such good terms with her as to venture to take 	54.56830972042722
why i have only had the honor of being in her society and conversing with her th	38.76516224925392
at that instant the countess perceived franz and graciously waved her hand to hi	43.10996295346961
upon my word said albert you seem to be on excellent terms with the beautiful co	22.908786105819757
you are mistaken in thinking so returned franz calmly but you merely fall into t	122.20958680532213
is there indeed my good fellow pray tell me is it sympathy of heart	95.88480709255313
no of taste continued franz gravely	373.98361223923143
and in what manner has this congeniality of mind been evinced	233.27478700385524
by the countesss visiting the colosseum as we did last night by moonlight and ne	127.49270884050809
you were with her then	139.21664843191974
i was	26.565243331424504
and what did you say to her	15.752675462518008
oh we talked of the illustrious dead of whom that magnificent ruin is a glorious	184.38997360215453
upon my word cried albert you must have been a very entertaining companion alone	32.42212520236924
20143 m	1.1575373480886022
and you will probably find your theme illchosen	125.15728759943788
but said albert breaking in upon his discourse never mind the past let us only r	208.33752662755174
are you not going to keep your promise of introducing me to the fair subject of 	29.15040218967305
certainly directly the curtain falls on the stage	155.57229723469547
what a confounded long time this first act lasts	297.0610812621997
i believe on my soul that they never mean to finish it	97.42240967371217
oh yes they will only listen to that charming finale	152.92028358695492
how exquisitely coselli sings his part	815.9712175453934
but what an awkward inelegant fellow he is	116.87701483790838
well then what do you say to la specchia did you ever see anything more perfect 	44.01529014947386
why you know my dear fellow when one has been accustomed to malibran and sontag 	25.73739699648721
at least you must admire morianis style and execution	280.13617963035233
i never fancied men of his dark ponderous appearance singing with a voice like a	154.91413541859
my good friend said franz turning to him while albert continued to point his gla	36.410474732632224
the curtain at length fell on the performances to the infinite satisfaction of t	68.3180836530224
franz who had mutely interrogated the countess and received from her a gracious 	81.80698887492763
this important task was just completed as they arrived at the countesss box	113.3089091085905
at the knock the door was immediately opened and the young man who was seated be	31.046092816385045
franz presented albert as one of the most distinguished young men of the day bot	34.33962529957596
franz added that his companion deeply grieved at having been prevented the honor	204.08338333926528
the countess in reply bowed gracefully to albert and extended her hand with cord	123.0769128060728
albert was soon deeply engrossed in discoursing upon paris and parisian matters 	167.87937508961707
franz perceived how completely he was in his element and unwilling to interfere 	63.69831533620085
sitting alone in the front of a box immediately opposite but situated on the thi	71.62822092953397
behind her but in deep shadow was the outline of a masculine figure but the feat	92.0839176582264
franz could not forbear breaking in upon the apparently interesting conversation	545.6665920767839
all i can tell about her replied the countess is that she has been at rome since	45.953205442570145
sometimes she is accompanied by the person who is now with her and at others she	73.16746357099406
and what do you think of her personal appearance	53.32301027244722
oh i consider her perfectly lovelyshe is just my idea of what medora must have b	117.48365854996307
franz and the countess exchanged a smile and then the latter resumed her convers	70.79048627363338
the curtain rose on the ballet which was one of those excellent specimens of the	40.487143448376074
the ballet was called poliska	121.11771734296019
however much the ballet might have claimed his attention franz was too deeply oc	104.76568089499231
of this he took no heed but was as far as appearances might be trusted enjoying 	129.54390659711095
the ballet at length came to a close and the curtain fell amid the loud unanimou	97.85899000599566
owing to the very judicious plan of dividing the two acts of the opera with a ba	37.71623783398171
the overture to the second act began and at the first sound of the leaders bow a	86.99352268100506
the countenance of the person who had addressed her remained so completely in th	58.526852403545846
the curtain rose and the attention of franz was attracted by the actors and his 	42.582460042771146
most of my readers are aware that the second act of parisina opens with the cele	31.45013010559938
the injured husband goes through all the emotions of jealousy until conviction s	682.4717082938673
this duet is one of the most beautiful expressive and terrible conceptions that 	63.42227132902694
franz now listened to it for the third time yet its notes so tenderly expressive	169.0552624837935
excited beyond his usual calm demeanor franz rose with the audience and was abou	90.36160607629306
the occupant of the box in which the greek girl sat appeared to share the univer	76.99940416568984
all doubt of his identity was now at an end his singular host evidently resided 	262.360948563847
the surprise and agitation occasioned by this full confirmation of franzs former	317.12739489716614
countess returned franz totally unheeding her raillery i asked you a short time 	130.12040034994044
nay answered the countess i know no more of him than yourself	41.58130396779713
perhaps you never before noticed him	369.06211596432894
what a questionso truly french do you not know that we italians have eyes only f	85.4561425822864
true replied franz	5.672935377121193
all i can say is continued the countess taking up the lorgnette and directing it	101.31100640331154
how ghastly pale he is	741.8977606963816
oh he is always as colorless as you now see him said franz	37.351666930703246
then you know him almost screamed the countess	126.42149768639997
oh pray do for heavens sake tell us all aboutis he a vampire or a resuscitated c	116.93002732658067
i fancy i have seen him before and i even think he recognizes me	75.10515070830358
and i can well understand said the countess shrugging up her beautiful shoulders	85.39825834346478
the sensation experienced by franz was evidently not peculiar to himself another	212.4290915488324
inquired franz after the countess had a second time directed her lorgnette at th	65.02261089145132
20147 m	1.1068105689795753
why that he is no other than lord ruthven himself in a living form	78.27255786187605
this fresh allusion to byron5 drew a smile to franzs countenance although he cou	89.72217306159044
i must positively find out who and what he is said franz rising from his seat	91.84987307982455
no no cried the countess you must not leave me	19.58730493562442
i depend upon you to escort me home	162.23199923147354
oh indeed i can not permit you to go	33.79336181283393
is it possible whispered franz that you entertain any fear	56.77774956625411
ill tell you answered the countess	37.66841141874151
byron had the most perfect belief in the existence of vampires and even assured 	96.35276117867785
the description he gave me perfectly corresponds with the features and character	254.65552434742182
oh he is the exact personification of what i have been led to expect the coalbla	38.58258607926887
then observe too that the woman with him is altogether unlike all others of her 	226.02793287105735
she is a foreignera stranger	85.30867830037182
nobody knows who she is or where she comes from	199.60919827958728
no doubt she belongs to the same horrible race he does and is like himself a dea	128.63597584919944
i entreat of you not to go near himat least tonight and if tomorrow your curiosi	107.90822418366919
for that purpose i mean to keep you all to myself	51.85800011979393
franz protested he could not defer his pursuit till the following day for many r	84.59379897253602
listen to me said the countess and do not be so very headstrong	22.616441443545668
i am going home	78.79051950951936
i have a party at my house tonight and therefore can not possibly remain till th	81.36652342011308
now i can not for one instant believe you so devoid of gallantry as to refuse a 	105.73045344152158
there was nothing else left for franz to do but to take up his hat open the door	77.24841116430764
it was quite evident by her manner that her uneasiness was not feigned and franz	43.84350263921091
franz could even feel her arm tremble as he assisted her into the carriage	122.25977108242382
upon arriving at her hotel franz perceived that she had deceived him when she sp	42.45894208664197
excuse my little subterfuge said the countess in reply to her companions halfrep	54.6091637063437
franz essayed to smile	165.8982051389277
nay said she do not smile it ill accords with the expression of your countenance	71.58734906315824
however promise me one thing	135.38054134182377
what is it	5.225778553423399
promise me i say	37.86707795068634
i will do anything you desire except relinquish my determination of finding out 	238.1953476581124
i have more reasons than you can imagine for desiring to know who he is from whe	102.39516480586565
where he comes from i am ignorant but i can readily tell you where he is going t	35.97466468204404
let us only speak of the promise you wished me to make said franz	48.128403805819744
well then you must give me your word to return immediately to your hotel and mak	32.01890389650839
there are certain affinities between the persons we quit and those we meet after	208.82836198671973
for heavens sake do not serve as a conductor between that man and me	70.09040439269226
pursue your chase after him tomorrow as eagerly as you please but never bring hi	146.86886298560518
and now goodnight go to your rooms and try to sleep away all recollections of th	94.40180700745162
for my own part i am quite sure i shall not be able to close my eyes	27.963289561694086
so saying the countess quitted franz leaving him unable to decide whether she we	108.09114596982779
upon his return to the hotel franz found albert in his dressinggown and slippers	24.21102503275249
my dear fellow cried he springing up is it really you why i did not expect to se	45.12867529931288
my dear albert replied franz i am glad of this opportunity to tell you once and 	19.78480666169792
i should have thought the continual failures you have met with in all your own l	75.03495438380432
upon my soul these women would puzzle the very devil to read them aright	209.25937765601032
why herethey give you their handthey press yours in returnthey keep up a whisper	492.33911068266553
why if a parisian were to indulge in a quarter of these marks of flattering atte	61.540950561296825
and the very reason why the women of this fine country where sounds the si as da	152.58646494355372
besides you must have perceived that the countess was really alarmed	92.71555401773381
at what at the sight of that respectable gentleman sitting opposite to us in the	55.951065694504926
i can assure you that this hobgoblin of yours is a deuced finelooking fellowadmi	54.28177564550689
indeed i feel quite sure from the cut of his clothes they are made by a firstrat	73.49520971156338
he was rather too pale certainly but then you know paleness is always looked upo	190.39342303703663
franz smiled for he well remembered that albert particularly prided himself on t	154.34830201770032
well that tends to confirm my own ideas said franz that the countesss suspicions	142.09939198148555
did he speak in your hearing and did you catch any of his words	105.30177870909549
i did but they were uttered in the romaic dialect	71.00607292669336
i knew that from the mixture of greek words	84.02903192873451
i do nt know whether i ever told you that when i was at college i was ratherrath	27.42820425843259
he spoke the romaic language did he	85.33349570163966
i think so	40.89029207547447
that settles it murmured franz	160.91086871122175
tis he past all doubt	2513.2136949764895
what do you say	5.008364305966672
nothing nothing	592.9125744810602
but tell me what were you thinking about when i came in	40.325635789403464
oh i was arranging a little surprise for you	58.379629000486766
of what nature	934.2201741512943
why you know it is quite impossible to procure a carriage	40.511263542518336
certainly and i also know that we have done all that human means afforded to end	110.39478977807941
now then in this difficulty a bright idea has flashed across my brain	139.64395071329648
franz looked at albert as though he had not much confidence in the suggestions o	20.74075649884326
i tell you what m	54.30195563664724
franz cried albert you deserve to be called out for such a misgiving and incredu	48.08088757168789
and i promise to give you the satisfaction of a gentleman if your scheme turns o	65.11901543414382
well then hearken to me	40.111660594133
i listen	2913.3207883136397
you agree do you not that obtaining a carriage is out of the question	99.08445209864239
i do	18.406620841560304
neither can we procure horses	480.7866526533655
true we have offered any sum but have failed	222.8110069720636
well now what do you say to a cart i dare say such a thing might be had	59.81016059762534
very possibly	1578.98381214641
and a pair of oxen	42.82069129136053
as easily found as the cart	235.63445953144475
then you see my good fellow with a cart and a couple of oxen our business can be	47.06958842274957
the cart must be tastefully ornamented and if you and i dress ourselves as neapo	140.27622707050833
it would add greatly to the effect if the countess would join us in the costume 	98.48589778423626
our group would then be quite complete more especially as the countess is quite 	180.61965917308973
well said franz this time m	47.61926379681123
albert i am bound to give you credit for having hit upon a most capital idea	90.2360064176343
and quite a national one too replied albert with gratified pride	165.6259861823841
a mere masque borrowed from our own festivities	190.39106259854043
ha ha ye romans you thought to make us unhappy strangers trot at the heels of yo	102.2030691426661
but you do nt know us when we ca nt have one thing we invent another	61.08574063569778
and have you communicated your triumphant idea to anybody	347.30372990110845
only to our host	261.60478916084
upon my return home i sent for him and i then explained to him what i wished to 	42.39347654761118
he assured me that nothing would be easier than to furnish all i desired	92.600987755584
one thing i was sorry for when i bade him have the horns of the oxen gilded he t	63.89205963169958
and where is he now	34.69265874298734
our host	354.31026265223744
gone out in search of our equipage by tomorrow it might be too late	113.22411391264556
then he will be able to give us an answer tonight	31.10058203275877
oh i expect him every minute	237.5272977171941
at this instant the door opened and the head of signor pastrini appeared	17.808601790321163
permesso inquired he	149.33088533719828
certainlycertainly cried franz	17.70181612313182
come in my host	132.08734162107976
now then asked albert eagerly have you found the desired cart and oxen	103.706505388348
better than that replied signor pastrini with the air of a man perfectly well sa	32.989060430775126
take care my worthy host said albert better is a sure enemy to well	156.9784405735711
let your excellencies only leave the matter to me returned signor pastrini in a 	60.15547202059329
but what have you done asked franz	10.469144401355058
speak out there s a worthy fellow	106.83255915730469
your excellencies are aware responded the landlord swelling with importance that	150.23128954385712
i should think we did know it exclaimed albert since it is owing to that circums	60.03294263716527
when then the count of monte cristo hearing of the dilemma in which you are plac	21.425051970983564
the friends looked at each other with unutterable surprise	26.5807336141928
but do you think asked albert that we ought to accept such offers from a perfect	81.71361657585486
what sort of person is this count of monte cristo asked franz of his host	26.94179398210814
a very great nobleman but whether maltese or sicilian i can not exactly say but 	102.47790915830763
it seems to me said franz speaking in an undertone to albert that if this person	26.92303769179629
he would have writtenor	117.16583634029652
at this instant someone knocked at the door	37.46281020121237
come in said franz	19.871426516260392
a servant wearing a livery of considerable style and richness appeared at the th	70.54756039722504
please to deliver these from the count of monte cristo to vicomte albert de morc	34.9404899097234
franz dpinay	218.5171851839744
the count of monte cristo continued the servant begs these gentlemens permission	89.74164137748969
faith franz whispered albert there is not much to find fault with here	104.30530023097543
tell the count replied franz that we will do ourselves the pleasure of calling o	33.6732851593864
the servant bowed and retired	48.27621799309619
that is what i call an elegant mode of attack said albert you were quite correct	67.87501888513114
the count of monte cristo is unquestionably a man of firstrate breeding and know	27.792750657185156
then you accept his offer said the host	69.37640164940377
of course we do replied albert	25.148432785450208
still i must own i am sorry to be obliged to give up the cart and the group of r	47.646655873293035
what say you franz	41.70432694157706
oh i agree with you the windows in the palazzo rospoli alone decided me	82.5381375534116
the truth was that the mention of two places in the palazzo rospoli had recalled	51.470916112165646
franz passed the night in confused dreams respecting the two meetings he had alr	112.72833748034256
the next day must clear up every doubt and unless his near neighbor and wouldbe 	352.30429528807423
eight oclock found franz up and dressed while albert who had not the same motive	69.91585996838201
the first act of franz was to summon his landlord who presented himself with his	48.26505463511928
pray signor pastrini asked franz is not some execution appointed to take place t	157.80602013168163
yes your excellency but if your reason for inquiry is that you may procure a win	100.43180605849423
oh no answered franz i had no such intention and even if i had felt a wish to wi	37.356110955399735
ah exclaimed mine host i did not think it likely your excellency would have chos	103.06494126438777
very possibly i may not go answered franz but in case i feel disposed give me so	109.63967910616417
what particulars would your excellency like to hear	202.6298393777873
why the number of persons condemned to suffer their names and description of the	81.62922500428313
that happens just lucky your excellency only a few minutes ago they brought me t	135.1176084191641
what are they	28.660524564487755
sort of wooden tablets hung up at the corners of streets the evening before an e	93.90893129685767
the reason for so publicly announcing all this is that all good and faithful cat	327.7961027200833
and these tablets are brought to you that you may add your prayers to those of t	79.88492015523254
oh dear no your excellency i have not time for anybodys affairs but my own and t	83.707221212838
upon my word that is a most delicate attention on your part signor pastrini crie	50.537115893641584
why your excellency returned the landlord chuckling and rubbing his hands with i	68.49909057499391
i see that plainly enough my most excellent host and you may rely upon me to pro	84.93104525564466
meanwhile oblige me by a sight of one of these tavolettas	72.35415052589521
nothing can be easier than to comply with your excellencys wish said the landlor	55.4724392190514
then taking the tablet from the wall he handed it to franz who read as follows	44.87965805225151
the public is informed that on wednesday february 23rd being the first day of th	86.73415142728169
john lateran and the latter convicted of being an accomplice of the atrocious an	57.87882012593097
the firstnamed malefactor will be mazzolato the second culprit decapitato	184.2078850599266
the prayers of all good christians are entreated for these unfortunate men that 	168.31012149378918
this was precisely what franz had heard the evening before in the ruins of the c	41.324747537793314
no part of the programme differedthe names of the condemned persons their crimes	132.44241880593555
in all probability therefore the transteverin was no other than the bandit luigi	64.94542279687033
time was getting on however and franz deemed it advisable to awaken albert but a	94.24802853911144
the anticipated delights of the carnival had so run in his head as to make him l	78.53496874144068
now my excellent signor pastrini said franz addressing his landlord since we are	75.04636889787734
most assuredly replied he	46.740852067354396
the count of monte cristo is always an early riser and i can answer for his havi	30.45663513549642
then you really consider we shall not be intruding if we pay our respects to him	57.06962113662678
20155 m	1.101968172775014
oh i am quite sure	14.282114584890365
i will take all the blame on myself if you find i have led you into an error	69.72306314442534
well then if it be so are you ready albert	62.9784260997851
let us go and return our best thanks for his courtesy	69.4779691880829
yes let us do so	19.591998825253224
the landlord preceded the friends across the landing which was all that separate	236.72923933158305
i signori francesi	299.1336732096833
the domestic bowed respectfully and invited them to enter	129.79357959308354
they passed through two rooms furnished in a luxurious manner they had not expec	75.0883563237038
the richest turkey carpets covered the floor and the softest and most inviting c	191.4039178377612
splendid paintings by the first masters were ranged against the walls intermingl	91.47023531745734
if your excellencies will please to be seated said the man i will let the count 	39.324587762309065
and with these words he disappeared behind one of the tapestried portires	63.37299586517836
as the door opened the sound of a guzla reached the ears of the young men but wa	23.45994311214093
franz and albert looked inquiringly at each other then at the gorgeous furnishin	24.559322758984788
everything seemed more magnificent at a second view than it had done at their fi	155.10572176224034
well said franz to his friend what think you of all this	27.06051558509133
why upon my soul my dear fellow it strikes me that our elegant and attentive nei	88.35171644580335
hush hush replied franz we shall ascertain who and what he ishe comes	104.79780763689523
as franz spoke he heard the sound of a door turning on its hinges and almost imm	37.600855257262296
albert instantly rose to meet him but franz remained in a manner spellbound on h	39.1871181418614

franz and i have to thank you a thousand times count returned albert you extrica	52.850872553672794
indeed returned the count motioning the two young men to sit down	21.651416033233296
it was the fault of that blockhead pastrini that i did not sooner assist you in 	43.657706712326764
he did not mention a syllable of your embarrassment to me when he knows that alo	84.03568350733917
as soon as i learned i could in any way assist you i most eagerly seized the opp	76.74018467612204
the two young men bowed	15.07788618554601
franz had as yet found nothing to say he had come to no determination and as not	81.30574875079203
he resolved therefore to let things take their course without making any direct 	252.45302819702297
moreover he had this advantage he was master of the counts secret while the coun	52.348743874697924
however he resolved to lead the conversation to a subject which might possibly c	113.30004855174069
count said he you have offered us places in your carriage and at your windows in	53.582263024682305
can you tell us where we can obtain a sight of the piazza del popolo	24.997188322428194
ah said the count negligently looking attentively at morcerf is there not someth	33.67273120870361
yes returned franz finding that the count was coming to the point he wished	43.95003401736319
stay i think i told my steward yesterday to attend to this perhaps i can render 	93.60412199565067
he extended his hand and rang the bell thrice	59.63015893627529
did you ever occupy yourself said he to franz with the employment of time and th	39.84049402763344
when i ring once it is for my valet twice for my majordomo thrice for my steward	127.59999326719415
here he is	16.49531279042397
a man of about fortyfive or fifty entered exactly resembling the smuggler who ha	243.68381477627545
it was evident he had his orders	28.619452314851014
monsieur bertuccio said the count you have procured me windows looking on the pi	25.494407394807308
yes excellency returned the steward but it was very late	42.858993092450355
did i not tell you i wished for one replied the count frowning	35.201319060850395
and your excellency has one which was let to prince lobanieff but i was obliged 	119.66133979293456
that will dothat will do monsieur bertuccio spare these gentlemen all such domes	260.0552250374463
you have the window that is sufficient	96.6021949797391
give orders to the coachman and be in readiness on the stairs to conduct us to i	57.53036244456844
the steward bowed and was about to quit the room	42.333410477921554
ah continued the count be good enough to ask pastrini if he has received the tav	36.76258091837744
there is no need to do that said franz taking out his tablets for i saw the acco	19.255887135857538
very well you can retire m	57.57726389055809
bertuccio i need you no longer	79.51707624490447
let us know when breakfast is ready	137.1116993713987
these gentlemen added he turning to the two friends will i trust do me the honor	91.27482476017249
but my dear count said albert we shall abuse your kindness	23.84576278823007
not at all on the contrary you will give me great pleasure	21.24683398392993
you will one or other of you perhaps both return it to me at paris	123.8305299177478
bertuccio lay covers for three	399.0596668372715
he then took franzs tablets out of his hand	45.450201335720266
we announce he read in the same tone with which he would have read a newspaper t	53.389223535206376

hum the first will be mazzolato the second decapitato	68.37635545266207
yes continued the count it was at first arranged in this way but i think since y	39.70374829003021
really said franz	5.458329766742454
yes i passed the evening at the cardinal rospigliosis and there mention was made	95.55631387999226
for andrea rondolo asked franz	17.169145372871405
no replied the count carelessly for the other he glanced at the tablets as if to	47.31622437325724
you are thus deprived of seeing a man guillotined but the mazzolata still remain	186.91683333388346
the mandaa6 never fails never trembles never strikes thirty times ineffectually 	1025.232205594331
ah added the count in a contemptuous tone do not tell me of european punishments	24.71524131704398
really count replied franz one would think that you had studied the different to	87.44876888839747
there are at least few that i have not seen said the count coldly	45.48589886295867
and you took pleasure in beholding these dreadful spectacles	328.12012747327384
my first sentiment was horror the second indifference the third curiosity	368.1323415339658
curiositythat is a terrible word	109.80495693871681
why so in life our greatest preoccupation is death is it not then curious to stu	139.91375691931714
i do not quite understand you replied franz pray explain your meaning for you ex	65.14237009820029
listen said the count and deep hatred mounted to his face as the blood would to 	60.92423612973929
if a man had by unheardof and excruciating tortures destroyed your father your m	181.97326961822807
yes i know said franz that human justice is insufficient to console us she can g	75.37915262961165
i will put another case to you continued the count that where society attacked b	248.58604222423259
but are there not a thousand tortures by which a man may be made to suffer witho	56.715784537664575
yes answered franz and it is to punish them that duelling is tolerated	87.50053244120967
ah duelling cried the count a pleasant manner upon my soul of arriving at your e	116.20687959300022
and remember moreover that it is often he who comes off victorious from the stri	131.25724745504533
no no continued the count had i to avenge myself it is not thus i would take rev	55.406218219367254
then you disapprove of duelling you would not fight a duel asked albert in his t	45.87966128997442
oh yes replied the count understand me i would fight a duel for a trifle for an 	50.127325494592
oh i would fight for such a cause but in return for a slow profound eternal tort	140.5507398854562
but said franz to the count with this theory which renders you at once judge and	44.66192638098846
hatred is blind rage carries you away and he who pours out vengeance runs the ri	306.0135783436302

what matters this punishment as long as he is avenged on my word i almost regret	92.95659144948254
as he spoke a servant opened one of the four doors of the apartment saying	43.3070136517056
al suo commodo	520.1575747181635
the two young men arose and entered the breakfastroom	37.57546671698766
during the meal which was excellent and admirably served franz looked repeatedly	207.30909096943657
as for the count he just touched the dishes he seemed to fulfil the duties of a 	46.6432667602724
this brought back to franz in spite of himself the recollection of the terror wi	38.69298219984677
at the end of the breakfast franz took out his watch	15.703170260656675
well said the count what are you doing	9.02646431300354
you must excuse us count returned franz but we have still much to do	46.76223093141223
what may that be	45.31454027218548
we have no masks and it is absolutely necessary to procure them	38.42232709074113
do not concern yourself about that we have i think a private room in the piazza 	46.77148550432687
after the execution cried franz	81.68455453496242
before or after whichever you please	185.08738341353373
opposite the scaffold	138.625433099173
the scaffold forms part of the fte	273.3554837858961
count i have reflected on the matter said franz i thank you for your courtesy bu	47.13537437703129
but i warn you you will lose a very curious sight returned the count	78.66179639575495
you will describe it to me replied franz and the recital from your lips will mak	60.12934623960271
i have more than once intended witnessing an execution but i have never been abl	96.68583645044517
i replied the viscounti saw castaing executed but i think i was rather intoxicat	58.36006246398129
besides it is no reason because you have not seen an execution at paris that you	35.9629417946254
think what a figure you will make when you are asked how do they execute at rome	89.72247254215246
diable when a churchman is killed it should be with a different weapon than a lo	67.58229256873737
if you went to spain would you not see the bullfights well suppose it is a bullf	30.054288458277952
think of the eighty thousand applauding spectators the sage matrons who took the	85.42888607364961
shall you go then albert asked franz	12.132774243890253
ma foi yes like you i hesitated but the counts eloquence decides me	119.67434994603903
let us go then said franz since you wish it but on our way to the piazza del pop	16.632973192022636

on foot yes in a carriage no	229.4573344921257
i will go on foot then	44.012960529154725
is it important that you should go that way	58.881654605846094
yes there is something i wish to see	27.715317667802797

we will send the carriage to wait for us on the piazza del popolo by the via del	19.182713461338796
excellency said a servant opening the door a man in the dress of a penitent wish	57.798480712487496

i will be with you directly	44.30843773749793
the young men rose and returned into the salon while the count again apologizing	71.350193757355
albert who was a great smoker and who had considered it no small sacrifice to be	41.56367113664168
well asked franz what think you of the count of monte cristo	15.759038954946973
what do i think said albert evidently surprised at such a question from his comp	31.48629266372152
such was alberts opinion of the count and as franz well knew that albert profess	60.65700332031617
but said he did you observe one very singular thing	94.37943755637961
how attentively he looked at you	158.31143935665833
at me	719.1405455671614
albert reflected	1023.7930091769879

franz smiled an instant after the count entered	63.21861607437775
i am now quite at your service gentlemen said he	28.180962189944534

it consisted as we have said of a small dressingroom opening into a bedroom and 	66.71150750112834
on chairs were laid elegant masquerade costumes of blue and white satin	144.06051298963487

as you left the choice of your costumes to me said the count to the two friends 	46.07640728171859
franz heard the words of the count but imperfectly and he perhaps did not fully 	80.11704717514685

one of them lifted the plank took out a flask of wine drank some and then passed	78.98104279410393
these two men were the executioners assistants	56.578863062948166

it was evident that the execution was in the eyes of the people only the commenc	25.369718318153755
suddenly the tumult ceased as if by magic and the doors of the church opened	34.59087193666719
a brotherhood of penitents clothed from head to foot in robes of gray sackcloth 	81.13874597405501
20169 m	1.0923773087105675
behind the penitents came a man of vast stature and proportions	55.14130869773888
he was naked with the exception of cloth drawers at the left side of which hung 	51.33615407580542
this man was the executioner	37.39393772350668
he had moreover sandals bound on his feet by cords	154.2564042280533
behind the executioner came in the order in which they were to die first peppino	79.31084980086194
each was accompanied by two priests	63.56020408985462
neither had his eyes bandaged	90.01253860178673
peppino walked with a firm step doubtless aware of what awaited him	181.36091369220054
andrea was supported by two priests	52.93867098614505
each of them from time to time kissed the crucifix a confessor held out to them	162.68145321684898
at this sight alone franz felt his legs tremble under him	88.18504150908423

and yet here are two culprits	121.85957045588532
yes but only one of these two is about to die the other has many years to live	97.4363005968003
if the pardon is to come there is no time to lose	40.33979064161347
and see here it is said the count	47.38606054014965

a pardon cried the people with one voice a pardon	198.2188983631235
at this cry andrea raised his head	21.914795839747956
pardon for whom cried he	111.92016842952943
peppino remained breathless	507.73394525260295
a pardon for peppino called rocca priori said the principal friar	109.6781641399081

you have no right to put me to death alone	49.07193004704785

franz sprang back but the count seized his arm and held him before the window	49.02664986773149

the recommendation was needless	473.2846742756085

nothing replied the count only as you see the carnival has commenced	58.817589781646475
make haste and dress yourself	231.491437274399
in fact said franz this horrible scene has passed away like a dream	57.41074361226407
it is but a dream a nightmare that has disturbed you	54.828858537586
yes that i have suffered but the culprit	58.03958504200263

it must be allowed that andrea was not very handsome the hideous scoundrel come 	85.81757117454795
franz felt it would be ridiculous not to follow his two companions example	80.17326318544872

at one of these encounters accidentally or purposely alberts mask fell off	108.4023907262575
he instantly rose and cast the remainder of the bouquets into the carriage	67.1661588924314
doubtless one of the charming females albert had detected beneath their coquetti	83.23826461349562
albert seized it and as franz had no reason to suppose it was meant for him he s	37.57204465347919
albert placed it in his buttonhole and the carriage went triumphantly on	73.31840916718629
well said franz to him there is the beginning of an adventure	25.020889733364385
laugh if you pleasei really think so	95.95483217291714
so i will not abandon this bouquet	106.2185467638
pardieu returned franz laughing in token of your ingratitude	71.78115927507886
the jest however soon appeared to become earnest for when albert and franz again	154.98218353936835

tell it to me	15.270816144338646
it would frighten you too much	94.44935406695919
so much the more reason	42.01845276596447
at least wait until the story has a conclusion	233.23463495457338
very well i prefer complete histories but tell me how you made his acquaintance 	150.96181155877028
no it was he who introduced himself to us	45.67874542342353
last night after we left you	88.84494862968253
through what medium	1335.022512503247
the very prosaic one of our landlord	93.30288244410754
he is staying then at the htel de londres with you	35.39855126634611
not only in the same hotel but on the same floor	30.36762417274255
what is his name for of course you know	28.26710850170101
the count of monte cristo	4.688861199055569
that is not a family name	43.33829996804652
no it is the name of the island he has purchased	29.440595612833082
and he is a count	44.40003726597538
a tuscan count	312.2716856367353
well we must put up with that said the countess who was herself from one of the 	32.19168848764262
what sort of a man is he	32.82071984493313

you hear m	155.86648671046626

the beautiful greek of yesterday	1060.184223255309
no we heard i think the sound of her guzla but she remained perfectly invisible	180.0677463975157
when you say invisible interrupted albert it is only to keep up the mystery for 	64.40904773736541
where was this window with white hangings asked the countess	116.76833362596562
at the rospoli palace	21.57833590739062
the count had three windows at the rospoli palace	49.750348539846826
did you pass through the corso	17.167270678221737
well did you notice two windows hung with yellow damask and one with white damas	68.81468583795778
why he must be a nabob	34.804776029771524
do you know what those three windows were worth	27.709794058492434
two or three hundred roman crowns	19.466952617804793
two or three thousand	6.932543995724329
the deuce	902.1712203958378
does his island produce him such a revenue	243.99658659725648
it does not bring him a bajocco	50.93506208413043
then why did he purchase it	49.912496695012294
for a whim	201.68996687204947
he is an original then	65.72680418013762
in reality observed albert he seemed to me somewhat eccentric were he at paris a	167.22455647672174
this morning he made two or three exits worthy of didier or anthony	52.59843151947655
at this moment a fresh visitor entered and according to custom franz gave up his	43.52598458837253
this circumstance had moreover the effect of changing the conversation an hour a	102.32888080636853
signor pastrini had already set about procuring their disguises for the morrow a	115.43468939877454
the next morning at nine oclock he entered franzs room followed by a tailor who 	24.79078736487984
albert was impatient to see how he looked in his new dressa jacket and breeches 	69.8933601155478
this picturesque attire set him off to great advantage and when he had bound the	212.55392252395478

gentlemen said he although a companion is agreeable perfect freedom is sometimes	261.6927476779139

make use of it i pray you for your pleasure or your business	51.87218346461465
the young men wished to decline but they could find no good reason for refusing 	115.00675038644276
the count of monte cristo remained a quarter of an hour with them conversing on 	20.568416969290922
he was as we have already said perfectly well acquainted with the literature of 	52.779915679521146
a glance at the walls of his salon proved to franz and albert that he was a conn	24.25145949464419
a few words he let fall showed them that he was no stranger to the sciences and 	61.99452708001648
the two friends did not venture to return the count the breakfast he had given t	30.624216248759
they told him so frankly and he received their excuses with the air of a man who	48.23682401527716
albert was charmed with the counts manners and he was only prevented from recogn	42.89899627152872
the permission to do what he liked with the carriage pleased him above all for t	238.7014308519716
at halfpast one they descended the coachman and footman had put on their livery 	109.89824807465058
albert had fastened the faded bunch of violets to his buttonhole	92.22506153464576
at the first sound of the bell they hastened into the corso by the via vittoria	18.140964570651303

the day was as gay as the preceding one perhaps even more animated and noisy the	133.07698450061002
it is almost needless to say that the flirtation between albert and the fair pea	48.08105952264881
in the evening on his return franz found a letter from the embassy informing him	41.50055562576199
at each previous visit he had made to rome he had solicited and obtained the sam	65.6663439087997
peters successors who has set the rare example of all the virtues	175.50028836941777
he did not then think of the carnival for in spite of his condescension and touc	33.91063252735017
on his return from the vatican franz carefully avoided the corso he brought away	95.92148269893217
at ten minutes past five albert entered overjoyed	66.7767828034413
the harlequin had reassumed her peasants costume and as she passed she raised he	165.75721831861037
she was charming	108.17746151340882
franz congratulated albert who received his congratulations with the air of a ma	55.849775211220454
he had recognized by certain unmistakable signs that his fair incognita belonged	146.314972293183
he had made up his mind to write to her the next day	28.38333192182281
franz remarked while he gave these details that albert seemed to have something 	101.45951994585864
he insisted upon it declaring beforehand that he was willing to make any sacrifi	92.59436465367018
albert let himself be pressed just as long as friendship required and then avowe	170.95515846129678
albert attributed to franzs absence the extreme kindness of the fair peasant in 	155.28740030238606
franz was not sufficiently egotistical to stop albert in the middle of an advent	30.304873070487115
he felt assured that the perfect indiscretion of his friend would duly inform hi	134.28069992009407
he therefore promised albert that he would content himself the morrow with witne	83.51047368487735
the next morning he saw albert pass and repass holding an enormous bouquet which	69.84311993199601
this belief was changed into certainty when franz saw the bouquet conspicuous by	184.92744344749437
the evening was no longer joy but delirium	104.13250920357538
albert nothing doubted but that the fair unknown would reply in the same manner	172.59504109867189
franz anticipated his wishes by saying that the noise fatigued him and that he s	127.45745362455636
albert was not deceived for the next evening franz saw him enter triumphantly sh	45.447568222098035
well said he was i mistaken	44.91777744567175
she has answered you cried franz	72.35528907272125
this word was pronounced in a manner impossible to describe	58.585236668959936
franz took the letter and read	13.242034427426654

when you arrive at the first step of the church of san giacomo be sure to fasten	27.912520077189974
until then you will not see me	26.931589094159587
constancy and discretion	429.12838248615657
well asked he when franz had finished what do you think of that	30.77893508446859
i think that the adventure is assuming a very agreeable appearance	73.46500691630827

franz and albert had received that morning an invitation from the celebrated rom	62.55051105329718

whether she goes there or not my opinion is still the same returned albert	105.47801881416413
you have read the letter	34.465159364442776
you know how imperfectly the women of the mezzo cito are educated in italy this 	72.33693650133095
well read the letter again	182.06223226423597
look at the writing and find if you can any blemish in the language or orthograp	72.04258787936341
the writing was in reality charming and the orthography irreproachable	208.4925594778984
you are born to good fortune said franz as he returned the letter	43.52499874621416
laugh as much as you will replied albert i am in love	26.10801400503298

after dinner the count of monte cristo was announced	16.248185999487156
they had not seen him for two days	18.685716508997146
signor pastrini informed them that business had called him to civita vecchia	55.187078241926024
he had started the previous evening and had only returned an hour since	72.92729917619867

whether he kept a watch over himself or whether by accident he did not sound the	105.59456832085746
the man was an enigma to franz	48.76265716865937
the count must feel sure that franz recognized him and yet he had not let fall a	73.71653763135278
on his side however great franzs desire was to allude to their former interview 	163.48623574166785
the count had learned that the two friends had sent to secure a box at the argen	20.785953355254016
in consequence he brought them the key of his ownat least such was the apparent 	128.63634388020492
franz and albert made some difficulty alleging their fear of depriving him of it	88.02967798182746
this assurance determined the two friends to accept it	150.2882508494162

he was at least forty and yet it was easy to understand that he was formed to ru	25.881491986206843
and to complete his resemblance with the fantastic heroes of the english poet th	131.89273811625785
albert was constantly expatiating on their good fortune in meeting such a man	193.83279516343347

a knot of rosecolored ribbons fell from his shoulder almost to the ground	64.28527208207773
in order that there might be no confusion franz wore his peasants costume	95.96636308272869

a new source of noise and movement was added to the crowd	110.37126205457736
the sellers of moccoletti entered on the scene	203.86765378890203

you might as well have tried to stop number three of the barberi who gained the 	130.66014011110505
who can tell the night is gloomy and the tiber is very near the via macello	46.36107069905989
franz felt a shudder run through his veins at observing that the feeling of the 	63.977299680031074
i informed them at the hotel that i had the honor of passing the night here duke	84.01120348700034

the duke was not mistaken when he saw franz the servant came up to him	30.793527023009297
your excellency he said the master of the htel de londres has sent to let you kn	22.005924073793206
a letter from the viscount exclaimed franz	54.94218089855577
and who is the man	22.73075239116907
i do not know	5.297805690242929
why did he not bring it to me here	24.72865645201762
the messenger did not say	52.275669255303384
and where is the messenger	44.10299234006167

yes if it is not any serious affair otherwise i can not answer as to what i may 	56.49844220057632
be prudent in any event said the countess	44.96410804527081
oh pray be assured of that	56.28134233000174
franz took his hat and went away in haste	37.70029794074347
he had sent away his carriage with orders for it to fetch him at two oclock fort	42.080309186919855
as he came near the hotel franz saw a man in the middle of the street	14.324055635830836
he had no doubt that it was the messenger from albert	29.802429021271518
the man was wrapped up in a large cloak	32.20138359431884
he went up to him but to his extreme astonishment the stranger first addressed h	99.54025106126741
what wants your excellency of me inquired the man retreating a step or two as if	75.74551439166822
are not you the person who brought me a letter inquired franz from the viscount 	78.11316342432659
your excellency lodges at pastrinis hotel	119.1549318795615

20199 m	1.058475972638404
then it is to your excellency that this letter is addressed	36.05808708902633
is there any answer inquired franz taking the letter from him	40.69800776543528
yesyour friend at least hopes so	501.22869465931393
come upstairs with me and i will give it to you	26.394104448506674
i prefer waiting here said the messenger with a smile	74.96092745342577
and why	59.99136355517189
your excellency will know when you have read the letter	42.04103936086723
shall i find you here then	41.739759258497905
franz entered the hotel	56.43573247191113
on the staircase he met signor pastrini	82.06888191528833
well said the landlord	25.04586160834564
wellwhat responded franz	176.14870351072926
you have seen the man who desired to speak with you from your friend he asked of	40.929140806596415
yes i have seen him he replied and he has handed this letter to me	27.002492957376607
light the candles in my apartment if you please	123.11101505168267
the innkeeper gave orders to a servant to go before franz with a light	63.6536209024052
the young man had found signor pastrini looking very much alarmed and this had o	96.3242797513644
it was written and signed by albert	56.95210086873816
franz read it twice before he could comprehend what it contained	187.33379702369808
it was thus worded	79.94021091525659
my dear fellow	7.822526241655473
the moment you have received this have the kindness to take the letter of credit	77.7229705201976
run to torlonia draw from him instantly four thousand piastres and give them to 	71.5565313346383
it is urgent that i should have this money without delay	81.52447035578159
i do not say more relying on you as you may rely on me	34.7721548786566
your friend	72.05206981616784
albert de morcerf	16.836285290428616
i now believe in italian banditti	241.80301737330853
below these lines were written in a strange hand the following in italian	100.93470470744614
se alle sei della mattina le quattro mille piastre non sono nelle mie mani alla 	5.598635873303363
luigi vampa	14.693799666385374
if by six in the morning the four thousand piastres are not in my hands by seven	65.99792854588516
this second signature explained everything to franz who now understood the objec	124.00898030940773
albert then had fallen into the hands of the famous bandit chief in whose existe	48.174301550339706
there was no time to lose	15.25431746633229
he hastened to open the secrtaire and found the pocketbook in the drawer and in 	44.173256726064466
there were in all six thousand piastres but of these six thousand albert had alr	75.73988015019751
as to franz he had no letter of credit as he lived at florence and had only come	35.99921193148128
thus seven or eight hundred piastres were wanting to them both to make up the su	40.91984223399628
true he might in such a case rely on the kindness of signor torlonia	70.67163165882918
he was therefore about to return to the palazzo bracciano without loss of time w	43.17216015091155
he remembered the count of monte cristo	11.946897377955146
franz was about to ring for signor pastrini when that worthy presented himself	132.50343910732977
my dear sir he said hastily do you know if the count is within	35.76041633762937
yes your excellency he has this moment returned	144.84478318606585
is he in bed	84.00960111574068
i should say no	117.01804432287965
then ring at his door if you please and request him to be so kind as to give me 	64.29728941891398
signor pastrini did as he was desired and returning five minutes after he said	90.88915559345608
the count awaits your excellency	102.55534099271905
franz went along the corridor and a servant introduced him to the count	53.20695085834755
he was in a small room which franz had not yet seen and which was surrounded wit	49.68709631323524
the count came towards him	45.022560805204456
well what good wind blows you hither at this hour said he have you come to sup w	103.62632668960171
no i have come to speak to you of a very serious matter	26.783818767999758
a serious matter said the count looking at franz with the earnestness usual to h	38.79178931440315
are we alone	137.23447247754092
yes replied the count going to the door and returning	38.9125983696883
franz gave him alberts letter	96.26793890302632
read that he said	17.300356034118682
the count read it	80.83794874408174
well well said he	11.666061197649352
did you see the postscript	20.84527898049186
i did indeed	145.33536887032102
se alle sei della mattina le quattro mille piastre non sono nelle mie mani alla 	5.815998531819326
luigi vampa	14.787600200070319
what think you of that inquired franz	30.192152650390526
have you the money he demands	69.94660480481824
yes all but eight hundred piastres	246.33065675402875
the count went to his secrtaire opened it and pulling out a drawer filled with g	47.49337461381496
you see on the contrary i come to you first and instantly replied franz	47.141016165036596
and i thank you have what you will and he made a sign to franz to take what he p	36.78709569940045
is it absolutely necessary then to send the money to luigi vampa asked the young	41.9426050540339
judge for yourself replied he	46.110793646932926
the postscript is explicit	255.05351571069545
i think that if you would take the trouble of reflecting you could find a way of	48.837771924983976
how so returned the count with surprise	53.76292445575377
if we were to go together to luigi vampa i am sure he would not refuse you alber	21.467307174863794
what influence can i possibly have over a bandit	406.1027075985385
have you not just rendered him a service that can never be forgotten	78.69237206353685
what is that	7.0499024350812425
have you not saved peppinos life	41.01642386278769
well well said the count who told you that	13.899238162082977
no matter i know it	16.82122717401035
the count knit his brows and remained silent an instant	100.48104865285735
and if i went to seek vampa would you accompany me	53.85687324658736
if my society would not be disagreeable	79.40151437434042
be it so	8.292790194600418
it is a lovely night and a walk without rome will do us both good	118.59189809676354
shall i take any arms	89.4521070527699
for what purpose	24.08363063526417
any money	124.9370846103605
it is useless	10.23757551083765
where is the man who brought the letter	18.99023960715323
in the street	31.694038309794006
he awaits the answer	429.76544126770784
i must learn where we are going	75.86979086345644
i will summon him hither	146.5831983347123
it is useless he would not come up	30.546708108309716
to your apartments perhaps but he will not make any difficulty at entering mine	107.77745430785755
the count went to the window of the apartment that looked on to the street and w	22.405945832962946
the man in the mantle quitted the wall and advanced into the middle of the stree	29.84894204692247
salite said the count in the same tone in which he would have given an order to 	13.37759694523768
the messenger obeyed without the least hesitation but rather with alacrity and m	247.7165707054972
ah it is you peppino said the count	15.169515765461043
but peppino instead of answering threw himself on his knees seized the counts ha	53.54358149743069
ah said the count you have then not forgotten that i saved your life that is str	34.00260176347711

no excellency and never shall i forget it returned peppino with an accent of pro	39.143772218921626
never that is a long time but it is something that you believe so	33.911885713853366
rise and answer	173.37733929727304
peppino glanced anxiously at franz	55.27751883507426
oh you may speak before his excellency said he he is one of my friends	38.69145085926128
you allow me to give you this title continued the count in french it is necessar	30.630992680993636
you can speak before me said franz i am a friend of the counts	29.53514814147307
good returned peppino	25.941688486438625
i am ready to answer any questions your excellency may address to me	53.33098204238293
how did the viscount albert fall into luigis hands	65.33732870488949
excellency the frenchmans carriage passed several times the one in which was ter	86.91984084285237
the chiefs mistress	8813.338295248685
the frenchman threw her a bouquet teresa returned itall this with the consent of	165.70980158139164
what cried franz was luigi vampa in the carriage with the roman peasants	36.93960940474228
it was he who drove disguised as the coachman replied peppino	103.20323024186106
well said the count	6.3505890847766935
well then the frenchman took off his mask teresa with the chiefs consent did the	61.76682177981087
the frenchman asked for a rendezvous teresa gave him oneonly instead of teresa i	87.2624904365643
what exclaimed franz the peasant girl who snatched his mocoletto from him	47.32028573166341
was a lad of fifteen replied peppino	39.16552322381891
but it was no disgrace to your friend to have been deceived beppo has taken in p	49.46204163273207
and beppo led him outside the walls said the count	60.861025048764404
exactly so a carriage was waiting at the end of the via macello	24.869119711014957
beppo got in inviting the frenchman to follow him and he did not wait to be aske	37.600030509999065
he gallantly offered the righthand seat to beppo and sat by him	178.3828043888056
beppo told him he was going to take him to a villa a league from rome the french	28.03715026742676
the coachman went up the via di ripetta and the porta san paolo and when they we	28.393660416055926
at the same time four of the band who were concealed on the banks of the almo su	18.223354768254286
the frenchman made some resistance and nearly strangled beppo but he could not r	50.83007741863765
they made him get out walk along the banks of the river and then brought him to 	59.10822122857628
well said the count turning towards franz it seems to me that this is a very lik	14.629934032470747
what do you say to it	10.89834647582887
why that i should think it very amusing replied franz if it had happened to anyo	36.5605466260391
and in truth if you had not found me here said the count it might have proved a 	35.96440801843945
and shall we go and find him inquired franz	31.840084750046675
oh decidedly sir	677.8675350725183
he is in a very picturesque placedo you know the catacombs of st	31.37254362534492
i was never in them but i have often resolved to visit them	81.36407914617374
well here is an opportunity made to your hand and it would be difficult to contr	43.41963219607206
have you a carriage	22.147759909935107
that is of no consequence i always have one ready day and night	178.6744565685197
always ready	2453.7370545323583
i am a very capricious being and i should tell you that sometimes when i rise or	58.693811157745166
the count rang and a footman appeared	70.64679996254942
order out the carriage he said and remove the pistols which are in the holsters	55.91108734284901
you need not awaken the coachman ali will drive	157.24199496376147
in a very short time the noise of wheels was heard and the carriage stopped at t	21.871294801274935
the count took out his watch	25.074343448453938
halfpast twelve he said	388.0772931016237
we might start at five oclock and be in time but the delay may cause your friend	116.65547021947229
are you still resolved to accompany me	27.772342498368545
more determined than ever	235.75730021770474
well then come along	96.87606154778791
franz and the count went downstairs accompanied by peppino	43.69725727071948
at the door they found the carriage	17.135742663276854
ali was on the box in whom franz recognized the dumb slave of the grotto of mont	77.41246364451916
franz and the count got into the carriage	22.301598672574567
peppino placed himself beside ali and they set off at a rapid pace	47.76809947785275
ali had received his instructions and went down the corso crossed the campo vacc	38.80280606026495
then the porter raised some difficulties but the count of monte cristo produced 	53.65150994472337
the road which the carriage now traversed was the ancient appian way and bordere	129.0803410064372

a short time before they reached the baths of caracalla the carriage stopped pep	29.172156845362895
in ten minutes said the count to his companion we shall be there	25.164830793052076
he then took peppino aside gave him an order in a low voice and peppino went awa	28.746635842739323
five minutes elapsed during which franz saw the shepherd going along a narrow pa	69.44928481035228
now said the count let us follow him	13.448603668564584
franz and the count in their turn then advanced along the same path which at the	63.48230003720167
they then perceived two men conversing in the obscurity	77.44975489419988
ought we to go on asked franz of the count or should we pause	64.35682673944133
let us go on peppino will have warned the sentry of our coming	51.923310295851955
one of the two men was peppino and the other a bandit on the lookout	40.262854732162566
franz and the count advanced and the bandit saluted them	58.25077208912733
your excellency said peppino addressing the count if you will follow me the open	25.72587565415923
go on then replied the count	16.999480958498168
they came to an opening behind a clump of bushes and in the midst of a pile of r	23.686529280732877
peppino glided first into this crevice after they got along a few paces the pass	243.37805874511457
peppino passed lighted his torch and turned to see if they came after him	112.16154358576993
the count first reached an open space and franz followed him closely	125.66589361187624
the passageway sloped in a gentle descent enlarging as they proceeded still fran	243.3565901272025
they went on a hundred and fifty paces in this way and then were stopped by who 	75.3890737107755
a friend responded peppino and advancing alone towards the sentry he said a few 	140.76832040647156
behind the sentinel was a staircase with twenty steps	145.46002604539262
franz and the count descended these and found themselves in a mortuary chamber	72.06059088183487
five corridors diverged like the rays of a star and the walls dug into niches wh	84.4383603455984

the count laid his hand on franzs shoulder	29.669194954359643
would you like to see a camp of bandits in repose he inquired	120.60595115502184
exceedingly replied franz	12.217284661892847
come with me then	30.916570288328614
peppino put out the torch	73.03911510497936
peppino obeyed and franz and the count were in utter darkness except that fifty 	94.78606366935614
they advanced silently the count guiding franz as if he had the singular faculty	62.48322906224397
franz himself however saw his way more plainly in proportion as he went on towar	85.8187169703863
three arcades were before them and the middle one was used as a door	79.99874417491127
these arcades opened on one side into the corridor where the count and franz wer	42.35758018833723

the valet left the room	47.298572796755735
albert threw himself on the divan tore off the cover of two or three of the pape	26.35691478890118
these papers become more and more stupid every day	336.5388733535485
a moment after a carriage stopped before the door and the servant announced m	41.09526022042882
lucien debray	14.649560479788814
a tall young man with light hair clear gray eyes and thin and compressed lips dr	59.32759655665938
goodmorning lucien goodmorning said albert your punctuality really alarms me	89.87722363824973
what do i say punctuality you whom i expected last you arrive at five minutes to	121.6532324569165
no my dear fellow returned the young man seating himself on the divan reassure y	32.35529842667368
ah true you drive don carlos out of spain	59.64807496877915
no no my dear fellow do not confound our plans	59.662354771922615
we take him to the other side of the french frontier and offer him hospitality a	43.47124710054826
at bourges	18.982354120392788
yes he has not much to complain of bourges is the capital of charles vii	26.350826317380655

and you another order for i see you have a blue ribbon at your buttonhole	75.55418510833992
yes they sent me the order of charles iii	32.9270387440723
returned debray carelessly	115.24516508206298
come do not affect indifference but confess you were pleased to have it	145.72515606533648
oh it is very well as a finish to the toilet	52.06609312655814
it looks very neat on a black coat buttoned up	122.55470605960404
and makes you resemble the prince of wales or the duke of reichstadt	44.109775019003685
it is for that reason you see me so early	40.36769177725965
because you have the order of charles iii	17.36531011265402
and you wish to announce the good news to me	64.93950810356607
no because i passed the night writing lettersfiveandtwenty despatches	355.4709761286668
i returned home at daybreak and strove to sleep but my head ached and i got up t	81.39935364179634

really my dear albert replied lucien lighting a manilla at a rosecolored taper t	35.738375032489586
you do not know your own good fortune	29.78523878516903
and what would you do my dear diplomatist replied morcerf with a slight degree o	29.470631978649166
by introducing to you a new acquaintance	176.63267004009506
a man or a woman	36.800087439757945
a man	24.30619575047067
i know so many men already	84.67923650536059
but you do not know this man	10.495270533398841
where does he come fromthe end of the world	73.61912892091546
farther still perhaps	666.2313495810496
the deuce i hope he does not bring our breakfast with him	105.86378748329429
oh no our breakfast comes from my fathers kitchen	168.52791797104084
are you hungry	52.87615546284657
humiliating as such a confession is i am	136.9088448252562
but i dined at m	127.90195577915128
de villeforts and lawyers always give you very bad dinners	282.0687622290635
you would think they felt some remorse did you ever remark that	181.53603294034548
ah depreciate other persons dinners you ministers give such splendid ones	1253.2564165006147
yes but we do not invite people of fashion	105.79313936465947
if we were not forced to entertain a parcel of country boobies because they thin	116.32169402629587
well take another glass of sherry and another biscuit	137.8093068861673
your spanish wine is excellent	104.41303566385777
you see we were quite right to pacify that country	136.50084626666344
yes but don carlos	31.992821849702477
well don carlos will drink bordeaux and in ten years we will marry his son to th	57.634178718302266
you will then obtain the golden fleece if you are still in the ministry	63.03009966759774
i think albert you have adopted the system of feeding me on smoke this morning	94.60337080441332
well you must allow it is the best thing for the stomach but i hear beauchamp in	40.3858571205681
about what	63.03049038502563
about the papers	75.34555287210488
my dear friend said lucien with an air of sovereign contempt do i ever read the 	18.409043442146157
then you will dispute the more	75.76010758069019
beauchamp announced the servant	148.87820098380345
come in come in said albert rising and advancing to meet the young man	27.641705070258492
here is debray who detests you without reading you so he says	123.76530017142547
he is quite right returned beauchamp for i criticise him without knowing what he	59.66693527340459
goodday commander	23681.30272179862
ah you know that already said the private secretary smiling and shaking hands wi	114.52686686891525
and what do they say of it in the world	16.964029976196574
in which world we have so many worlds in the year of grace 1838	68.1006558030022
in the entire political world of which you are one of the leaders	90.46563670657076
they say that it is quite fair and that sowing so much red you ought to reap a l	58.18564571591151
come come that is not bad said lucien	30.85221408285814
why do you not join our party my dear beauchamp with your talents you would make	50.8608443291335
i only await one thing before following your advice that is a minister who will 	111.13697554226341
my dear albert one word for i must give poor lucien a respite	83.41750385836447
do we breakfast or dine i must go to the chamber for our life is not an idle one	89.05940231799713
you only breakfast i await two persons and the instant they arrive we shall sit 	261.42609366668194
chapter 40	1366.4757422171285
the breakfast	2065.470623449275
and what sort of persons do you expect to breakfast said beauchamp	31.998398171985915
a gentleman and a diplomatist	109.88294729794362
then we shall have to wait two hours for the gentleman and three for the diploma	49.92630268124246
i shall come back to dessert keep me some strawberries coffee and cigars	195.0546287763238
i shall take a cutlet on my way to the chamber	39.60141919604009

be it so i will stay i must do something to distract my thoughts	57.14306158415853
you are like debray and yet it seems to me that when the minister is out of spir	25.53267492557005
ah you do not know with what i am threatened	27.684179176158906
i shall hear this morning that m	103.92659826504263
danglars make a speech at the chamber of deputies and at his wifes this evening 	122.32852375080772
the devil take the constitutional government and since we had our choice as they	89.72568132519218
i understand you must lay in a stock of hilarity	95.21005791152406
do not run down m	271.53451547123905
danglars speeches said debray he votes for you for he belongs to the opposition	135.98592708227017
pardieu that is exactly the worst of all	62.316454834183546
i am waiting until you send him to speak at the luxembourg to laugh at my ease	66.31429970262755
my dear friend said albert to beauchamp it is plain that the affairs of spain ar	20.16663031866505
recollect that parisian gossip has spoken of a marriage between myself and mlle	74.12435614005139
eugnie danglars i can not in conscience therefore let you run down the speeches 	124.47243452114927
ah this marriage will never take place said beauchamp	61.72657303657798
the king has made him a baron and can make him a peer but he can not make him a 	42.29154494595749
the viscount of morcerf can only we d a marchioness	179.75770476517803
but two million francs make a nice little sum replied morcerf	82.1590950283148
it is the social capital of a theatre on the boulevard or a railroad from the ja	34.919728238810066
never mind what he says morcerf said debray do you marry her	38.489936745101076
you marry a moneybag label it is true well but what does that matter it is bette	85.00486518127249
you have seven martlets on your arms give three to your wife and you will still 	100.45987329523608
de guise had who so nearly became king of france and whose cousin was emperor of	186.40299980256577
on my word i think you are right lucien said albert absently	16.556324584444724
to be sure besides every millionaire is as noble as a bastardthat is he can be	104.49282653618614
do not say that debray returned beauchamp laughing for here is chteaurenaud who 	38.10046941095714
he will sully it then returned lucien for i am lowvery low	131.38223323668814

a rich uniform half french half oriental set off his graceful and stalwart figur	80.79552014444785
the young officer bowed with easy and elegant politeness	184.19435863325288

it is very well for you who risk your life every day but for me who only did so 	72.36626144214787
we gather from all this baron that captain morrel saved your life	223.16263492467277
exactly so	90.83950229299063
on what occasion asked beauchamp	21.28560626659023
beauchamp my good fellow you know i am starving said debray do not set him off o	38.28265346634219
well i do not prevent your sitting down to table replied beauchamp chteaurenaud 	67.46612202895672
gentlemen said morcerf it is only a quarter past ten and i expect someone else	54.29139224262645

well since we are not to sit down to table said debray take a glass of sherry an	25.349699265779424
you all know that i had the fancy of going to africa	56.36994738297967
it is a road your ancestors have traced for you said albert gallantly	84.19198668471795
yes but i doubt that your object was like theirsto rescue the holy sepulchre	129.2945905710991
you are quite right beauchamp observed the young aristocrat	39.74849139169617
it was only to fight as an amateur	51.83665204133417
i can not bear duelling ever since two seconds whom i had chosen to arrange an a	204.31512341861153

you are mistaken for i have made a vow never to return to africa	26.242881757275303
you were very much frightened then asked beauchamp	73.79781586880074
well yes and i had good reason to be so replied chteaurenaud	60.17784998606341
i was retreating on foot for my horse was dead	114.09070497165523
six arabs came up full gallop to cut off my head	43.965670727303134

20237 m	1.0353651055921553
heroic action interrupted chteaurenaud	181.46177696925753
i was chosen	97.37099797411692
but that is not allafter rescuing me from the sword he rescued me from the cold 	71.46957613799084
martin but by giving me the whole then from hunger by sharing with meguess what	289.8877198944222
a strasbourg pie asked beauchamp	124.0119960826553
no his horse of which we each of us ate a slice with a hearty appetite	147.90710613255382
it was very hard	42.2339895352937
the horse said morcerf laughing	99.72396557204021
no the sacrifice returned chteaurenaud ask debray if he would sacrifice his engl	88.46532811284212
not for a stranger said debray but for a friend i might perhaps	54.081277418943934
i divined that you would become mine count replied morrel besides as i had the h	65.13522616034804
the history to which m	230.7396230251999
morrel alludes continued chteaurenaud is an admirable one which he will tell you	126.29316121455959
what time do you breakfast albert	65.99242147933944
at halfpast ten	104.65877931361838
precisely asked debray taking out his watch	36.99266614817616
oh you will give me five minutes grace replied morcerf for i also expect a prese	50.06669746209189
of whom	67.99166656114173
of myself cried morcerf parbleu do you think i can not be saved as well as anyon	40.88961939963938
what shall we do said debray we have only one monthyon prize	28.80442969997547
well it will be given to someone who has done nothing to deserve it said beaucha	34.127139743159645
and where does he come from asked debray	33.7159908554135
you have already answered the question once but so vaguely that i venture to put	96.6929366346573
really said albert i do not know when i invited him three months ago he was then	32.548734683005144
and you think him capable of being exact demanded debray	79.97612657310619
i think him capable of everything	72.64000369913742
well with the five minutes grace we have only ten left	135.78888198264215
i will profit by them to tell you something about my guest	95.85737815312417
i beg pardon interrupted beauchamp are there any materials for an article in wha	97.53680161190114
yes and for a most curious one	92.99405375385318
go on then for i see i shall not get to the chamber this morning and i must make	33.16580720039064
i was at rome during the last carnival	62.93600736052617
we know that said beauchamp	16.802128025463443
yes but what you do not know is that i was carried off by bandits	47.26469797312486
there are no bandits cried debray	34.05654696930361
yes there are and most hideous or rather most admirable ones for i found them ug	148.10902330760337
come my dear albert said debray confess that your cook is behindhand that the oy	20.93128612972801
say so at once we are sufficiently wellbred to excuse you and to listen to your 	86.54134794383742
and i say to you fabulous as it may seem i tell it as a true one from beginning 	105.89847277827974
the brigands had carried me off and conducted me to a gloomy spot called the cat	151.56371647559502
i know it said chteaurenaud i narrowly escaped catching a fever there	161.74645335111126
and i did more than that replied morcerf for i caught one	58.86051644946732
i was informed that i was prisoner until i paid the sum of 4000 roman crownsabou	101.54329972455353
unfortunately i had not above 1500	206.92333176469964
i was at the end of my journey and of my credit	27.540551623730792
i wrote to franzand were he here he would confirm every wordi wrote then to fran	149.0783160403786
but franz did come with the four thousand crowns said chteaurenaud	63.92222819902388
a man whose name is franz dpinay or albert de morcerf has not much difficulty in	46.95515964277834
no he arrived accompanied simply by the guest i am going to present to you	71.2766072052365
ah this gentleman is a hercules killing cacus a perseus freeing andromeda	32.896295168556954
no he is a man about my own size	57.91973596154514
armed to the teeth	264.0113533648106
he had not even a knittingneedle	39.409820840935495
but he paid your ransom	93.2080773627255
he said two words to the chief and i was free	50.94485097993733
and they apologized to him for having carried you off said beauchamp	141.73836102244366
just so	91.93216149713307
why he is a second ariosto	18.801400292542418
no his name is the count of monte cristo	15.865516761090715
there is no count of monte cristo said debray	10.899926398252738
i do not think so added chteaurenaud with the air of a man who knows the whole o	17.662449475440557
does anyone know anything of a count of monte cristo	36.133000971758165
he comes possibly from the holy land and one of his ancestors possessed calvary 	113.87960048011507
i think i can assist your researches said maximilian	33.19216494073876
monte cristo is a little island i have often heard spoken of by the old sailors 	90.81234743990079
precisely cried albert	22.819141339549237

he is rich then	60.29595972413102
i believe so	91.24775732652303
but that ought to be visible	94.92845229548256
that is what deceives you debray	32.787816282346014
i do not understand you	8.046627022914693

which means	3011.394497964671
which means that my count of monte cristo is one of those fishermen	43.071313639923325
he has even a name taken from the book since he calls himself sinbad the sailor 	109.45559812984416

my dear albert said debray what you tell us is so extraordinary	35.650991565514296

they are too much taken up with interfering in the affairs of their countrymen w	38.01609216789178

for a man not connected with newspapers here is the pendant to the famous seaser	107.2050306784883
wild eyes the iris of which contracts or dilates at pleasure said debray facial 	59.914662432924544
just so lucien returned morcerf you have described him feature for feature	81.44823543684323
yes keen and cutting politeness	2445.6479388530465
this man has often made me shudder and one day when we were viewing an execution	62.51526617243793
did he not conduct you to the ruins of the colosseum and suck your blood asked b	76.22461518311188

when i look at you parisians idlers on the boulevard de gand or the bois de boul	19.19779369217902
i am highly flattered returned beauchamp	147.76900706685933
at the same time added chteaurenaud your count of monte cristo is a very fine fe	19.583256483648885
there are no italian banditti said debray	37.98698151403854
no vampire cried beauchamp	68.20607948261555
no count of monte cristo added debray	23.67178874638252
there is halfpast ten striking albert	328.40312888995345

confess you have dreamed this and let us sit down to breakfast continued beaucha	38.57696601855696
but the sound of the clock had not died away when germain announced his excellen	39.954213142698364
the involuntary start everyone gave proved how much morcerfs narrative had impre	927.7601205807118
he had not heard a carriage stop in the street or steps in the antechamber the d	53.7831936602187
the count appeared dressed with the greatest simplicity but the most fastidious 	67.61059269946983
every article of dresshat coat gloves and bootswas from the first makers	157.49848154904078
he seemed scarcely fiveandthirty	360.58380538401707
but what struck everybody was his extreme resemblance to the portrait debray had	176.90484210993205
the count advanced smiling into the centre of the room and approached albert who	43.05838690736235
punctuality said monte cristo is the politeness of kings according to one of you	49.48927840338498
however i hope you will excuse the two or three seconds i am behindhand five hun	45.042423483044686
my dear count replied albert i was announcing your visit to some of my friends w	28.09110655237567
they are the count of chteaurenaud whose nobility goes back to the twelve peers 	59.50790503018482

no one could have said what caused the counts voice to vibrate so deeply and wha	73.56477238101002
you have never seen our africans count said albert	28.631040809151486
never replied the count who was by this time perfectly master of himself again	80.44910436818395
well beneath this uniform beats one of the bravest and noblest hearts in the who	102.62108661088625

de morcerf interrupted morrel	28.607227377358587
let me go on captain	48.37004606650441
and we have just heard continued albert of a new deed of his and so heroic a one	67.67978125300071
at these words it was still possible to observe in monte cristo the concentrated	58.07130975297347
ah you have a noble heart said the count so much the better	23.344781268632605
this exclamation which corresponded to the counts own thought rather than to wha	140.2155719397079
but at the same time the intonation was so soft that however strange the speech 	55.23757397809468
20245 m	1.1281304330701571
why should he doubt it said beauchamp to chteaurenaud	23.113395254930158
in reality replied the latter who with his aristocratic glance and his knowledge	130.38629160651033
what say you morrel	41.81776251755453
ma foi he has an open look about him that pleases me in spite of the singular re	71.03929572220451
gentlemen said albert germain informs me that breakfast is ready	38.871928582266726
my dear count allow me to show you the way	21.390355025668185
they passed silently into the breakfastroom and everyone took his place	74.30306472034175
gentlemen said the count seating himself permit me to make a confession which mu	27.008873666079985
i am a stranger and a stranger to such a degree that this is the first time i ha	29.910941615970938
the french way of living is utterly unknown to me and up to the present time i h	74.78331103908664
i beg you therefore to excuse if you find anything in me too turkish too italian	80.06972790392807
now then let us breakfast	28.95461402405578
with what an air he says all this muttered beauchamp decidedly he is a great man	84.23619888966498
a great man in his own country added debray	57.780321220508114
a great man in every country m	138.1491966290842
debray said chteaurenaud	9.719529952722926
the count was it may be remembered a most temperate guest	117.45705179066887
albert remarked this expressing his fears lest at the outset the parisian mode o	153.42827066705235
my dear count said he i fear one thing and that is that the fare of the rue du h	17.798359376451586
i ought to have consulted you on the point and have had some dishes prepared exp	66.58425966939677
did you know me better returned the count smiling you would not give one thought	72.07660496497911
i eat everywhere and of everything only i eat but little and today that you repr	207.83426737160048
what cried all the guests you have not eaten for fourandtwenty hours	89.71892162268794
no replied the count i was forced to go out of my road to obtain some informatio	26.228313737030913
and you ate in your carriage asked morcerf	43.16260926169512
no i slept as i generally do when i am weary without having the courage to amuse	113.34165595800214
but you can sleep when you please monsieur said morrel	51.71582494049505
you have a recipe for it	34.0433955733214
an infallible one	196.2060275161096
that would be invaluable to us in africa who have not always any food to eat and	39.78342866693471
yes said monte cristo but unfortunately a recipe excellent for a man like myself	60.50269053454657
may we inquire what is this recipe asked debray	57.64792141549204
oh yes returned monte cristo i make no secret of it	26.494982253387825
it is a mixture of excellent opium which i fetched myself from canton in order t	35.81798719855406
these two ingredients are mixed in equal proportions and formed into pills	228.51841162831758
ten minutes after one is taken the effect is produced	118.5919546458007
ask baron franz dpinay i think he tasted them one day	233.77654665213174
yes replied morcerf he said something about it to me	30.005681222710216
but said beauchamp who as became a journalist was very incredulous you always ca	158.74745795875808
would it be an indiscretion to ask to see those precious pills continued beaucha	78.37212495766968
no monsieur returned the count and he drew from his pocket a marvellous casket f	27.679750646797185
this ball had an acrid and penetrating odor	120.41310395645444
there were four or five more in the emerald which would contain about a dozen	75.77820848515202
the casket passed around the table but it was more to examine the admirable emer	75.91354211383964
and is it your cook who prepares these pills asked beauchamp	98.65237680020424
oh no monsieur replied monte cristo i do not thus betray my enjoyments to the vu	25.038816348917646
i am a tolerable chemist and prepare my pills myself	123.67462597387998
this is a magnificent emerald and the largest i have ever seen said chteaurenaud	57.70614431407357
i had three similar ones returned monte cristo	94.7789679247591
i gave one to the sultan who mounted it in his sabre another to our holy father 	153.30065904150973
i kept the third for myself and i had it hollowed out which reduced its value bu	115.20725362703378
everyone looked at monte cristo with astonishment he spoke with so much simplici	49.45049795637741
however the sight of the emerald made them naturally incline to the former belie	54.9230069624992
and what did these two sovereigns give you in exchange for these magnificent pre	123.36505378332245
the sultan the liberty of a woman replied the count the pope the life of a man s	74.99989870988173
and it was peppino you saved was it not cried morcerf it was for him that you ob	53.17709750922409
perhaps returned the count smiling	36.892055337435856
my dear count you have no idea what pleasure it gives me to hear you speak thus 	55.87462769358484
i had announced you beforehand to my friends as an enchanter of the arabian nigh	49.006373882278254
for example here is debray who reads and beauchamp who prints every day a member	138.59793749518505

germain ten fifteen or twenty thieves have been arrested in a caf on the bouleva	67.84369647403858

ah said monte cristo you promised me never to mention that circumstance	47.10921969089533
it was not i who made that promise cried morcerf it must have been someone else 	47.10109986209082
pray speak of it for i shall not only i trust relate the little i do know but al	75.95199454754204
it seems to me returned the count smiling that you played a sufficiently importa	47.42109640941003

well you promise me if i tell all i know to relate in your turn all that i do no	49.432132676136156
that is but fair replied monte cristo	22.701425093135057
well said morcerf for three days i believed myself the object of the attentions 	38.38885969425135

i assure you franz and i were lost in admiration	71.70620505462877
nothing more simple returned the count	58.28722577684603
i had known the famous vampa for more than ten years	86.8596397760631

with the condition that they should sin no more said beauchamp laughing	140.23997796164994
i see they kept their promise	287.0894540439572
no monsieur returned monte cristo upon the simple condition that they should res	64.81703105231828

bravo count bravo	935.8984322233758
it is frank at least said morrel	21.194711798123517

the affair is still in projection	155.50317436359268

we were speaking of a suitable habitation for the count of monte cristo	25.1746063055093

where shall we lodge this new guest in our great capital	188.76832646967887
faubourg saintgermain said chteaurenaud	4.988950351820454
the count will find there a charming hotel with a court and garden	142.56327528810914

you have no idea then morrel asked chteaurenaud you do not propose anything	27.358661107875687

undeceive yourself monsieur replied monte cristo i am quite sure that on the con	21.429143974191696
he knows my tastes my caprices my wants	445.60310366113623
he has been here a week with the instinct of a hound hunting by himself	67.46052461958836
he will arrange everything for me	111.75580999451131

bertuccio who understands hiring windows so well	431.72614427733777
yes you saw him the day i had the honor of receiving you he has been a soldier a	41.0216071013361
i would not be quite sure that he has not been mixed up with the police for some	32.348055693521154
and you have chosen this honest citizen for your steward said debray	93.87266709359407
of how much does he rob you every year	172.84458950972288
on my word replied the count not more than another	31.43847991299878
i am sure he answers my purpose knows no impossibility and so i keep him	169.03478831864027
then continued chteaurenaud since you have an establishment a steward and a hote	53.31287881758021
albert smiled	98.30197972411713
he thought of the fair greek he had seen in the counts box at the argentina and 	26.905012890966937
i have something better than that said monte cristo i have a slave	28.82305354097832

who will tell her	99.59295059107589
the first person who sees her	178.8163685979378
she only speaks romaic	564.5920524706232
that is different	38.562832104040076
but at least we shall see her said beauchamp or do you keep eunuchs as well as m	41.316541147263635
oh no replied monte cristo i do not carry brutalism so far	30.058029082433443
everyone who surrounds me is free to quit me and when they leave me will no long	105.5806219002818
they had long since passed to dessert and cigars	104.44689700365802
my dear albert said debray rising it is halfpast two	25.12945707556581
your guest is charming but you leave the best company to go into the worst somet	75.36251258856728
i must return to the ministers	56.948461963352585
i will tell him of the count and we shall soon know who he is	36.82342443577929
take care returned albert no one has been able to accomplish that	37.84662554094934
oh we have three millions for our police it is true they are almost always spent	158.28019008761052
and when you know will you tell me	39.920686780980766

au revoir albert	2.583936004125631
gentlemen good morning	1302.4648147213834
as he left the room debray called out loudly my carriage	86.37273394476537
bravo said beauchamp to albert i shall not go to the chamber but i have somethin	12.290387273009793
for heavens sake beauchamp returned morcerf do not deprive me of the merit of in	37.69722401566617

directly i have given my card to the count who has promised to pay us a visit at	39.27490914136381
be sure i shall not fail to do so returned the count bowing	30.682163662865793
and maximilian morrel left the room with the baron de chteaurenaud leaving monte	30.850139833614655
chapter 41	1167.6338199092236
the presentation	3681.6904282305304
when albert found himself alone with monte cristo my dear count said he allow me	52.9079590146008
you who are accustomed to the palaces of italy can amuse yourself by calculating	76.1804666976169
as we pass from one room to another i will open the windows to let you breathe	99.40089802428737
monte cristo had already seen the breakfastroom and the salon on the ground floo	33.902071672752314
albert led him first to his atelier which was as we have said his favorite apart	77.99852606918647
monte cristo quickly appreciated all that albert had collected hereold cabinets 	115.3905529122258
morcerf had expected he should be the guide on the contrary it was he who under 	69.35057000639196
they descended to the first floor albert led his guest into the salon	38.46266403519007
the salon was filled with the works of modern artists there were landscapes by d	78.39466275472476
albert expected to have something new this time to show to the traveller but to 	99.79974483253058
from the salon they passed into the bedchamber it was a model of taste and simpl	41.23123421554481
a single portrait signed by lopold robert shone in its carved and gilded frame	173.44638479464064
this portrait attracted the count of monte cristos attention for he made three r	57.9370552134462
it was the portrait of a young woman of five or sixandtwenty with a dark complex	26.540022059741386
she wore the picturesque costume of the catalan fisherwomen a red and black bodi	47.83560300593626
she was looking at the sea and her form was outlined on the blue ocean and sky	51.078975510534605
the light was so faint in the room that albert did not perceive the pallor that 	57.508256005614676
silence prevailed for an instant during which monte cristo gazed intently on the	67.51761423542217
you have there a most charming mistress viscount said the count in a perfectly c	63.88173245574302

you do not know my mother she it is whom you see here	45.40652005640163
she had her portrait painted thus six or eight years ago	115.06868084155114
this costume is a fancy one it appears and the resemblance is so great that i th	64.75317740718324
the countess had this portrait painted during the counts absence	179.36547219941355
she doubtless intended giving him an agreeable surprise but strange to say this 	218.95556479420654
it is true between ourselves that m	168.48565371509335

monte cristo bowed without making any answer he accepted the offer without enthu	124.51333551306843
albert summoned his servant and ordered him to acquaint m	79.58334431194
and madame de morcerf of the arrival of the count of monte cristo	9.942224995663835
albert followed him with the count	47.745441136652715
when they arrived at the antechamber above the door was visible a shield which b	42.132833169883234
monte cristo stopped and examined it attentively	82.98146325155463

it is not indiscreet returned morcerf with the simplicity of conviction	29.66140784673596
you have guessed rightly	41.27885013394203
these are our arms that is those of my father but they are as you see joined to 	89.99927688997796
by her side i am spanish but the family of morcerf is french and i have heard on	32.032456939371635

ah here is my mother cried the viscount	38.01950028789741
monte cristo turned round hastily and saw madame de morcerf at the entrance of t	29.186662009367033
she had been there some moments and had heard the last words of the visitor	61.26408877813193
the latter rose and bowed to the countess who inclined herself without speaking	92.38928328367494
ah good heavens madame said the count are you ill or is it the heat of the room 	54.277815604114124
are you ill mother cried the viscount springing towards her	68.66345124251217
she thanked them both with a smile	58.02918001281454

the footman obeyed his orders	123.83472232557222
a long pause ensued which lasted until all the flowers were removed	203.97889428063118
what is this name of monte cristo inquired the countess when the servant had tak	18.22692653262013

i must tell you that i have not come to any decided opinion respecting him but i	44.5742285621713
i do not ask you of his origin but what he is	30.577216847368266

why he pleases me in spite of franz dpinay who tries to convince me that he is a	33.391233326451335
the countess shuddered	556.7184472048998

the count never plays he only drinks pure water tinged with a little sherry and 	213.9691513282716
what then have i to fear from him	90.39004848080715

the countess made no reply	59.70948529867633

i trust all this will soon be taken away	73.16997561962494
bertuccio bowed	93.44994962779792
as the steward had said the notary awaited him in the small salon	53.862831558500204
he was a simplelooking lawyers clerk elevated to the extraordinary dignity of a 	75.74273333548497
you are the notary empowered to sell the country house that i wish to purchase m	95.26609761898038

the steward made a gesture that signified i do not know	55.27830959197999
the notary looked at the count with astonishment	22.454310949695795
what said he does not the count know where the house he purchases is situated	81.98115241548886

ah that is different the house you purchase is at auteuil	50.25371404193213

and where is auteuil asked the count	18.4312303223242
close by here monsieur replied the notarya little beyond passy a charming situat	217.5549656581657
so near as that said the count but that is not in the country	33.0058254409851
what made you choose a house at the gates of paris m	61.355622974552766
i cried the steward with a strange expression	61.00394590459343
his excellency did not charge me to purchase this house	57.78957936834737
if his excellency will recollectif he will think	76.62832959790609
ah true observed monte cristo i recollect now	59.08156423491235

it is a charming place well supplied with springwater and fine trees a comfortab	128.90282900178914
i suppose the count has the tastes of the day	76.59278516860543

the steward left the room with a faltering step and returned with a bundle of ba	21.725204649899755
and now demanded the count are all the forms complied with	101.53071140410135

and your fee	595.6590649180348

see this gentleman out said the count to bertuccio	26.811739081669906
and the steward followed the notary out of the room	61.77495126430006
scarcely was the count alone when he drew from his pocket a book closed with a l	24.452414039733107

bertuccio cried he striking a light hammer with a pliant handle on a small gong	82.03026624597929
the steward appeared at the door	35.35529907249674
monsieur bertuccio said the count did you never tell me that you had travelled i	24.577141343098678
in some parts of franceyes excellency	168.39947070818195

well what is there surprising in that when i live at auteuil you must come there	47.13890322510158
bertuccio hung down his head before the imperious look of his master and remaine	37.66065276423961

monte cristo noticed as they descended the staircase that bertuccio signed himse	73.27629333303294
anyone but a man of exhaustless thirst for knowledge would have had pity on seei	70.83407808453035
in twenty minutes they were at auteuil the stewards emotion had continued to aug	70.28569161837035

bertuccio knocked the door opened and the concierge appeared	37.259406061477165
what is it asked he	12.657929097266509
it is your new master my good fellow said the footman	42.4657250388139
and he held out to the concierge the notarys order	118.04869197736149
the house is sold then demanded the concierge and this gentleman is coming to li	55.791483219570615

the steward obeyed in silence but it was easy to see from the manner in which th	40.6793819593965
they went over a tolerably large ground floor a first floor consisted of a salon	167.5888810287003
ah here is a private staircase said the count that is convenient	42.77748714393598

and pray how do you know that	21.80692257045854
it ought to do so at least	27.68384915699284
well let us be sure of that	14.146533532323597
bertuccio sighed and went on first the stairs did indeed lead to the garden	149.8405235629689
at the outer door the steward paused	73.74476911573522
go on monsieur bertuccio said the count	8.859046685908112

no monsieur it is impossible i can go no farther	54.01846865459678
what does this mean demanded the irresistible voice of monte cristo	47.14908666894731
why you must see your excellency cried the steward that this is not natural that	37.83535706880461

bertuccio raised the lantern and obeyed	62.870918848697755
the door as it opened disclosed a gloomy sky in which the moon strove vainly to 	104.81175060971374
the steward wished to turn to the left	78.63074518374552

bertuccio said the count i am very glad to tell you that while you gesticulate y	18.709641916082862
i knew you were a corsican	31.194009651544054

i do not deny it returned the count but why are you thus agitated	41.613883410842824
it is a bad sign a quiet conscience does not occasion such paleness in the cheek	220.24479401708865
but your excellency replied bertuccio hesitatingly did not the abb busoni who he	40.052583418662195

or as you are a corsican that you had been unable to resist the desire of making	50.53532062641252
yes my good master cried bertuccio casting himself at the counts feet it was sim	46.8170268238366
i understand that but i do not understand what it is that galvanizes you in this	30.096278936966115
but monsieur it is very natural returned bertuccio since it was in this house th	32.97837334875603

oh it was not on him monsieur it was on another	77.81000184841069
this is strange returned monte cristo seeming to yield to his reflections that y	48.13965033118188
monsieur said the steward it is fatality i am sure	23.15789254979181
first you purchase a house at auteuilthis house is the one where i have committe	55.60347487311239
this is not chance for chance in this case is too much like providence	128.37420485875205
well amiable corsican let us suppose it is providence	127.20517746954525
i always suppose anything people please and besides you must concede something t	288.31755666558627
come collect yourself and tell me all	97.14106938982597
i have related it but once and that was to the abb busoni	56.56796463540244
such things continued bertuccio shaking his head are only related under the seal	120.3101984791749
then said the count i refer you to your confessor	30.210420439665853
turn chartreux or trappist and relate your secrets but as for me i do not like a	44.433077229750836

you are no longer in my service monsieur bertuccio	16.908028890391943
oh your excellency your excellency cried the steward struck with terror at this 	44.90145953980944
that is different replied monte cristo but if you intend to tell an untruth refl	26.01801187255293

de villefort	1.0570180430850602
what cried monte cristo it was m	35.34237079829762
de villefort	1.0522583715499054
your excellency knows him	51.901502229843885
the former royal attorney at nmes	137.01764988950393
who married the marquis of saintmrans daughter	60.53607911413724
who enjoyed the reputation of being the most severe the most upright the most ri	77.1031237269211
well monsieur said bertuccio this man with this spotless reputation	52.63126010009855
was a villain	197.83212990378198
bah replied monte cristo impossible	62.86606240744949
it is as i tell you	14.471540411101032
ah really said monte cristo	11.404868298812024
have you proof of this	39.15481424486593
i had it	76.36056399934499
and you have lost it how stupid	132.25725609015015
yes but by careful search it might be recovered	223.1383742535358
really returned the count relate it to me for it begins to interest me	66.6587547074669
and the count humming an air from lucia went to sit down on a bench while bertuc	36.74093803238711
bertuccio remained standing before him	127.38478571350663

the vendetta	1714.1415343299616
at what point shall i begin my story your excellency asked bertuccio	69.91686012993513
where you please returned monte cristo since i know nothing at all of it	41.82867126404003
i thought the abb busoni had told your excellency	34.175684313183325
some particulars doubtless but that is seven or eight years ago and i have forgo	42.275868647025554
then i can speak without fear of tiring your excellency	96.44363643470456
go on m	15.617001444685489
bertuccio you will supply the want of the evening papers	208.73338701550196
the story begins in 1815	513.2657308852419
ah said monte cristo 1815 is not yesterday	45.573619225866445
no monsieur and yet i recollect all things as clearly as if they had happened bu	77.17915575652025
i had a brother an elder brother who was in the service of the emperor he had be	66.0552292880759
this brother was my only friend we became orphansi at five he at eighteen	299.67618916809994

when the emperor returned from the island of elba my brother instantly joined th	51.65227813506488
but that is the history of the hundred days m	48.897564644431334

excuse me excellency but these details are necessary and you promised to be pati	81.64218767468276
go on i will keep my word	36.81517273525269
one day we received a letter	73.25809140631124
i should tell you that we lived in the little village of rogliano at the extremi	20.278235889779126
this letter was from my brother	100.20735914895582
he told us that the army was disbanded and that he should return by chteauroux c	54.308908403293366
in the smuggling line said monte cristo	55.2673717921389
eh your excellency everyone must live	313.5716245723571
certainly go on	103.8621953455013
i loved my brother tenderly as i told your excellency and i resolved not to send	63.19646339244124
i possessed a thousand francs	112.09535142898639
i left five hundred with assunta my sisterinlaw and with the other five hundred 	92.22426996399018
it was easy to do so and as i had my boat and a lading to take in at sea everyth	52.53557877932768
but after we had taken in our cargo the wind became contrary so that we were fou	74.0153256274698
at last however we succeeded and worked up to arles	173.57288789132443
i left the boat between bellegarde and beaucaire and took the road to nmes	25.69493223578804
we are getting to the story now	88.48621143738671
yes your excellency excuse me but as you will see i only tell you what is absolu	28.58766606958247
just at this time the famous massacres took place in the south of france	23.684394694249587
three brigands called trestaillon truphemy and graffan publicly assassinated eve	236.40120800138195
you have doubtless heard of these massacres your excellency	60.98643687093097
vaguely i was far from france at that period	61.66102996825535
go on	7.469439119763821
as i entered nmes i literally waded in blood at every step you encountered dead 	203.6888627565073
at the sight of this slaughter and devastation i became terrified not for myself	70.15503833949448
i hastened to the innkeeper	68.08575236226488
my misgivings had been but too true	139.1573804332195
my brother had arrived the previous evening at nmes and at the very door of the 	32.58473096701453
i did all in my power to discover the murderers but no one durst tell me their n	60.88752680593024
i then thought of that french justice of which i had heard so much and which fea	71.59468857361455
and this kings attorney was named villefort asked monte cristo carelessly	81.32994458206487
yes your excellency he came from marseilles where he had been deputy procureur	68.8404820035807
his zeal had procured him advancement and he was said to be one of the first who	51.93385868572403
then said monte cristo you went to him	21.745010456851464
monsieur i said my brother was assassinated yesterday in the streets of nmes i k	37.48283178044046
you are the representative of justice here and it is for justice to avenge those	92.0933585843866
who was your brother asked he	35.84823040401236
a lieutenant in the corsican battalion	65.14746451502502
a soldier of the usurper then	90.9084869886735
a soldier of the french army	41.83557296416413
well replied he he has smitten with the sword and he has perished by the sword	57.98019629746255
you are mistaken monsieur i replied he has perished by the poniard	95.05011308994793
what do you want me to do asked the magistrate	10.648328558081099
i have already told youavenge him	145.64110084161473
on whom	51.666011032315915
on his murderers	152.7056177550814
how should i know who they are	56.52638646616585
order them to be sought for	78.51662117323673
why your brother has been involved in a quarrel and killed in a duel	74.59156673533253
all these old soldiers commit excesses which were tolerated in the time of the e	98.51558207376986
monsieur i replied it is not for myself that i entreat your interferencei should	55.70123756632218
pray try and obtain a small government pension for her	278.1850004738035
every revolution has its catastrophes returned m	423.13684473891396
de villefort your brother has been the victim of this	24.85037253073096
it is a misfortune and government owes nothing to his family	83.70322983665216
if we are to judge by all the vengeance that the followers of the usurper exerci	60.45620231488657
what has happened is quite natural and in conformity with the law of reprisals	52.86636099694063
what cried i do you a magistrate speak thus to me	130.9551687705532
all these corsicans are mad on my honor replied m	51.164781866362205
de villefort they fancy that their countryman is still emperor	247.58915150496344
you have mistaken the time you should have told me this two months ago it is too	48.65186029862121
go now at once or i shall have you put out	43.00507821686271
i looked at him an instant to see if there was anything to hope from further ent	69.91729353771808
but he was a man of stone	18.657323971607077
i approached him and said in a low voice well since you know the corsicans so we	48.29410776509549
you think that it was a good deed to kill my brother who was a bonapartist becau	24.68102917056596
well i who am a bonapartist also declare one thing to you which is that i will k	70.69273029400809
from this moment i declare the vendetta against you so protect yourself as well 	102.89008372717106
and before he had recovered from his surprise i opened the door and left the roo	43.19726188948436
well well said monte cristo such an innocent looking person as you are to do tho	55.42590442487396
bertuccio and to a kings attorney at that but did he know what was meant by the 	88.8187288288411
he knew so well that from that moment he shut himself in his house and never wen	53.88897116524323
fortunately i was so well concealed that he could not find me	27.27840495050535
then he became alarmed and dared not stay any longer at nmes so he solicited a c	97.55312769723679
but as you know a corsican who has sworn to avenge himself cares not for distanc	69.06060123389
the most important thing was not to kill him onlyfor i had an opportunity of doi	57.32987841447299
i no longer belonged to myself for i had my sisterinlaw to protect and provide f	88.06200529873219
for three months i watched m	111.60217599755669
de villefort for three months he took not a step outofdoors without my following	109.3022075789568
at length i discovered that he went mysteriously to auteuil	61.323595314904104
i followed him thither and i saw him enter the house where we now are only inste	46.19480675906008
monte cristo made a sign with his head to show that he could discern in the dark	26.32447801757266
as i had nothing more to do at versailles i went to auteuil and gained all the i	39.76702281281579
if i wished to surprise him it was evident this was the spot to lie in wait for 	81.42951789115305
the house belonged as the concierge informed your excellency to m	101.59647838572589
de saintmran villeforts fatherinlaw	42.948937557356544
de saintmran lived at marseilles so that this country house was useless to him a	58.848056073203495
one evening as i was looking over the wall i saw a young and handsome woman who 	48.42343554351775
de villefort	1.0485168677825731
when she was sufficiently near for me to distinguish her features i saw she was 	93.62572730767874
as she had a loose muslin dress on and as nothing concealed her figure i saw she	174.37042692766317
a few moments after the little door was opened and a man entered	20.267984066032724
the young woman hastened to meet him	19.774842012511698
they threw themselves into each others arms embraced tenderly and returned toget	166.53186812969668
the man was m	265.32095566437613
de villefort i fully believed that when he went out in the night he would be for	41.16351003131262
20291 m	1.2886345417732894
and asked the count did you ever know the name of this woman	28.23153337565428
no excellency returned bertuccio you will see that i had no time to learn it	29.2661263481197
go on	8.640356420215005
that evening continued bertuccio i could have killed the procureur but as i was 	47.051669878017194
three days after about seven oclock in the evening i saw a servant on horseback 	27.191342859071995
i concluded that he was going to versailles and i was not deceived	23.314545017017924
three hours later the man returned covered with dust his errand was performed an	105.98167289491116
i descended rapidly although i had not seen villeforts face i recognized him by 	136.44149829991576
i crossed the street and stopped at a post placed at the angle of the wall and b	40.08692779679762
this time i did not content myself with looking but i took my knife out of my po	41.45096434397987
my first care was to run to the door he had left the key in it taking the simple	69.13710857560744
nothing then preventing my escape by this means i examined the grounds	162.8735586438362
the garden was long and narrow a stretch of smooth turf extended down the middle	146.14170045910654
in order to go from the door to the house or from the house to the door m	28.17701177425737
de villefort would be obliged to pass by one of these clumps of trees	26.202469011766983
20293 m	1.6708969197360797
it was the end of september the wind blew violently	41.85470819571476
the faint glimpses of the pale moon hidden momentarily by masses of dark clouds 	108.48817884179438
i hid myself in the one nearest to the path villefort must take and scarcely was	264.1700229591339
two hours passed thus during which i imagined i heard moans repeatedly	164.84092955459164
midnight struck	734.5320481867726
as the last stroke died away i saw a faint light shine through the windows of th	40.84461427040133
the door opened and the man in the mantle reappeared	26.90149788968593
the terrible moment had come but i had so long been prepared for it that my hear	103.99495854997112
i drew my knife from my pocket again opened it and made ready to strike	100.20019201642036
the man in the mantle advanced towards me but as he drew near i saw that he had 	38.177423726930975
i was afraid not of a struggle but of a failure	65.99465571950901
when he was only a few paces from me i saw that what i had taken for a weapon wa	42.9134712166381
i was still unable to divine for what reason m	125.40867166764956
de villefort had this spade in his hands when he stopped close to the thicket wh	55.95810953830415
i then perceived that he was hiding something under his mantle which he laid on 	119.67446407644732
then i confess curiosity mingled with hatred i wished to see what villefort was 	68.93469051426501
then an idea crossed my mind which was confirmed when i saw the procureur lift f	105.98111700037207
i let him place the box in the hole he had made then while he stamped with his f	90.32576416067002
i am giovanni bertuccio thy death for my brothers thy treasure for his widow tho	133.86208516772408
i know not if he heard these words i think he did not for he fell without a cry	57.21506871149033
i felt his blood gush over my face but i was intoxicated i was delirious and the	52.85597605518977
in a second i had disinterred the box then that it might not be known i had done	61.55351150813875
ah said monte cristo it seems to me this was nothing but murder and robbery	39.916936930741095
no your excellency returned bertuccio it was a vendetta followed by restitution	71.12125071717139
and was the sum a large one	163.77274207490655
it was not money	57.99153272151439
ah i recollect replied the count did you not say something of an infant	43.73161970517189
yes excellency i hastened to the river sat down on the bank and with my knife fo	65.94441932923532
in a fine linen cloth was wrapped a newborn child	307.6190865515595
its purple visage and its violetcolored hands showed that it had perished from s	149.12524023698396
after a moment i fancied that i felt a slight pulsation of the heart and as i ha	24.82889852388442
in my turn i uttered a cry but a cry of joy	38.00232683552625
god has not cursed me then i cried since he permits me to save the life of a hum	61.962195458040256
20295 m	1.2596508238213606
and what did you do with the child asked monte cristo	17.054772435183324
it was an embarrassing load for a man seeking to escape	64.77389900188145
i had not for a moment the idea of keeping it but i knew that at paris there was	45.80512090415645
as i passed the city gates i declared that i had found the child on the road and	59.371150234006706
no objection was raised but they pointed out the asylum which was situated at th	111.95561018953566

in your service excellency where everything is learned	303.0605177731965
go on i am curious to know two things	83.65594651653473
what are they your excellency	41.07743195888415
what became of this little boy for i think you told me it was a boy m	81.78284610723152
no excellency i do not recollect telling you that	51.50995466938497
i thought you did i must have been mistaken	64.97652250509171
no you were not for it was in reality a little boy	56.40678403491235
but your excellency wished to know two things what was the second	92.15252911713812
the second was the crime of which you were accused when you asked for a confesso	65.81973314409758

what matter you know i take but little sleep and i do not suppose you are very m	90.3903932921356
bertuccio bowed and resumed his story	114.983391135432

the man who was with caderousse was evidently a stranger to the south of france 	36.19725536634237

an exclamation of joy was heard and the staircase creaked beneath a feeble step	53.44035487005292

there s only the price we are not agreed about	97.33348967141129
how not agreed about said caderousse	297.4158422816669
i thought we agreed for the price i asked	164.2241936421188
that is replied the jeweller i offered 40000 francs	73.97443204303374
forty thousand cried la carconte we will not part with it for that sum	84.37967678612726
the abb told us it was worth 50000 without the setting	157.6693541391375
what was the abbs name asked the indefatigable questioner	64.78378346860347
the abb busoni said la carconte	18.725430623672057
he was a foreigner	28.40332901663023

that did more honor to your heart than to your experience m	249.47700364406668
had you known this edmond dants of whom they spoke	41.72920201617115
no your excellency i had never heard of him before and never but once afterwards	78.07447310740221

however i will not go back on my word and i will give 45000	26.84904558660669

ah true replied the jeweller and he reset the stone	36.53912722091569
no matter observed caderousse replacing the box in his pocket someone else will 	108.11006349313331
yes continued the jeweller but someone else will not be so easy as i am or conte	39.44251379835595
it is not natural that a man like you should possess such a diamond	36.953747487766925
he will inform against you	280.6396913840808
you will have to find the abb busoni and abbs who give diamonds worth two thousa	135.4576413282274

caderousse and his wife looked eagerly at each other	30.63227803556552
no said caderousse we are not rich enough to lose 5000 francs	14.75511192436525
as you please my dear sir said the jeweller i had however as you see brought you	42.379480120084956
and he drew from his pocket a handful of gold and held it sparkling before the d	26.74785917138777
there was evidently a severe struggle in the mind of caderousse it was plain tha	47.67959945620913
he turned towards his wife	38.810874041127164
what do you think of this he asked in a low voice	11.190370212833182
let him have itlet him have it she said	125.89056264745297
if he returns to beaucaire without the diamond he will inform against us and as 	52.7046307368745
well then so i will said caderousse so you may have the diamond for 45000 francs	48.99439921473812
but my wife wants a gold chain and i want a pair of silver buckles	106.79283199323251
the jeweller drew from his pocket a long flat box which contained several sample	53.644257644922185
here he said i am very straightforward in my dealingstake your choice	46.757671219008316
the woman selected a gold chain worth about five louis and the husband a pair of	253.4759086412409
i hope you will not complain now said the jeweller	35.78658351408557

caderousse counted and again counted the gold and the notes then handed them to 	191.23031266019817
during this time the jeweller made the diamond play and sparkle in the lamplight	55.013460745641446
well inquired the jeweller is the cash all right	103.39789600984581
yes said caderousse	3.9609609463573614
give me the pocketbook la carconte and find a bag somewhere	122.64157664906537
la carconte went to a cupboard and returned with an old leathern pocketbook and 	22.039969474041687
from the former she took some greasy letters and put in their place the banknote	102.50014527052058

you can not think of going out in such weather as this	78.79397604809857

it seemed as though they were both inspired at the same time with some horrible 	56.07376587800231
well then a good journey to you said caderousse	30.66324508097603
thanks replied the jeweller	34.99067529712916
he then took his cane which he had placed against an old cupboard and went out	31.908334969720325
at the moment when he opened the door such a gust of wind came in that the lamp 	46.937743480813836

caderousse followed him slowly to the threshold	50.968748156420865

if you had been a man you would not have let him go from here	40.22475350387401

caderousses hands still grasped the gold and banknotes and la carconte called up	251.46832747570477

oh no answered caderousse that was not my reason i can assure you but the circum	31.17557820215598
the jeweller smiled	322.44183883321443
have you any other guests in your house inquired he	33.35563439777531
nobody but ourselves replied caderousse the fact is we do not lodge travellersin	108.87722081701553
then i am afraid i shall very much inconvenience you	55.33928463144823
inconvenience us not at all my dear sir said la carconte in her most gracious ma	43.13896755396942
not at all i assure you	19.990633021635347
but where will you manage to stow me	76.22061714778765
in the chamber overhead	93.87221947490318
surely that is where you yourselves sleep	391.0546323011904
never mind that we have a second bed in the adjoining room	41.185430853057
caderousse stared at his wife with much astonishment	78.94967733081505
the jeweller meanwhile was humming a song as he stood warming his back at the fi	163.6470607087988

and you asked joannes	22.73752227177791
i do nt want any supper said caderousse	25.24004801676612
we dined so very late hastily interposed la carconte	370.2741577390373
then it seems i am to eat alone remarked the jeweller	70.44369027103801
oh we shall have the pleasure of waiting upon you answered la carconte with an e	48.19378514914602
from time to time caderousse darted on his wife keen searching glances but rapid	144.60538651626203
the storm still continued	808.4203736530603
there there said la carconte do you hear that upon my word you did well to come 	46.84700652022253
nevertheless replied the jeweller if by the time i have finished my supper the t	32.85039809323785
its the mistral said caderousse and it will be sure to last till tomorrow mornin	70.69060666390696
he sighed heavily	604.4372311445277

yes chimed in la carconte they will have a wretched night of it	85.94788065208125

caderousse meanwhile continued to pace the room in gloomy silence sedulously avo	130.94243075483928
i believe the storm is over said he	77.5818215466484
but as if to contradict his statement at that instant a violent clap of thunder 	58.566103895662316
trembling and awestruck caderousse hastily shut the door and returned to his gue	62.02782203473325
you must be tired said she to the jeweller i have spread a pair of white sheets 	57.90915912527029
joannes stayed for a while to see whether the storm seemed to abate in its fury 	108.7237076142511
he passed over my head and i heard the flooring creak beneath his footsteps	77.85851019178568
the quick eager glance of la carconte followed him as he ascended while caderous	89.66152746278489
all these circumstances did not strike me as painfully at the time as they have 	57.61274665215907
overhead i could accurately distinguish every movement of the jeweller who after	308.22269677163956
insensibly my eyelids grew heavy deep sleep stole over me and having no suspicio	253.00412192595041
i looked into the kitchen once more and saw caderousse sitting by the side of a 	71.71403549206309
la carconte continued to gaze on him for some time then shrugging her shoulders 	58.56747230988165
at this moment the expiring embers threw up a fresh flame from the kindling of a	33.09997281774053

the womans lips seemed to move as though she were talking but because she merely	210.76369389121228
confused sights and sounds seemed to float before me and gradually i fell into a	137.8869353206922

weak and tottering footsteps resounded across the chamber above me and the next 	136.62639493551265

the poorly fastened boards which alone divided me from it yielded to my efforts 	573.7068158940316
hastily snatching up the lighted candle i hurried to the staircase about midway 	254.9106534186318
it was that of la carconte	18.421372043365878
the pistol i had heard had doubtless been fired at her	264.578090019104
the shot had frightfully lacerated her throat leaving two gaping wounds from whi	278.7336462333266

i rushed towards the staircase clutching my hair and uttering a groan of horror	105.74351204599843
upon reaching the room below i found five or six customhouse officers and two or	72.39117972930433
they threw themselves upon me	285.9580624428438
i made no resistance i was no longer master of my senses	61.327630756586856
when i strove to speak a few inarticulate sounds alone escaped my lips	100.55270427149972
as i noticed the significant manner in which the whole party pointed to my blood	157.18959349779718
i pointed to the spot where i had concealed myself	59.71065264984013

as a punishment for the crime i had committed answered bertuccio	72.27904603328048
oh those villeforts are an accursed race	182.00633260747887
truly they are murmured the count in a lugubrious tone	54.94089718835593

bertuccio bowed respectfully and turned away sighing heavily	174.77123630389391

there is the little door opening into the garden	81.91987960211357

summon bertuccio said the count	9.58280576603719
almost immediately bertuccio entered the apartment	52.282911045008824
did your excellency desire to see me inquired he	27.450944611844626
i did replied the count	45.93192267423263
you no doubt observed the horses standing a few minutes since at the door	60.40298087530489
certainly your excellency	19.22339679856475
i noticed them for their remarkable beauty	359.91008783145065
then how comes it said monte cristo with a frown that when i desired you to purc	33.44925634093672
at the look of displeasure added to the angry tone in which the count spoke ali 	65.19591243756736
it is not your fault my good ali said the count in the arabic language and with 	16.683392873609073
you do not understand the points of english horses	50.06439370673794
the countenance of poor ali recovered its serenity	161.14836437853182
permit me to assure your excellency said bertuccio that the horses you speak of 	27.939165550303457
monte cristo shrugged his shoulders	28.116642101942954
it seems sir steward said he that you have yet to learn that all things are to b	89.3937326607675
his excellency is not perhaps aware that m	62.89844576970208
danglars gave 16000 francs for his horses	83.49566162495695
very well	2.2611542455662423
then offer him double that sum a banker never loses an opportunity of doubling h	189.35403962916703
is your excellency really in earnest inquired the steward	90.72556701321888
monte cristo regarded the person who durst presume to doubt his words with the l	88.49587427956241
i have to pay a visit this evening replied he	54.97488632378132
i desire that these horses with completely new harness may be at the door with m	151.3964287384629
bertuccio bowed and was about to retire but when he reached the door he paused a	24.30769091900838
at five oclock replied the count	14.141812405296923
i beg your excellencys pardon interposed the steward in a deprecating manner for	48.60026986328021
i am perfectly aware of that fact answered monte cristo calmly	57.97969865158159
then turning towards ali he said let all the horses in my stables be led before 	70.42672927786049
request her also to oblige me by saying whether it is her pleasure to dine with 	168.57525687844506
now leave me and desire my valet de chambre to come hither	99.78989455574572
scarcely had ali disappeared when the valet entered the chamber	60.5884933133068
monsieur baptistin said the count you have been in my service one year the time 	18.104181968988737
you suit me very well	132.06674740880098
baptistin bowed low	57.33028847118401
it only remains for me to know whether i also suit you	93.30960071844945
oh your excellency exclaimed baptistin eagerly	16.727272034927495
listen if you please till i have finished speaking replied monte cristo	54.54561181985285
you receive 1500 francs per annum for your services heremore than many a brave s	151.13971728281416
you live in a manner far superior to many clerks who work ten times harder than 	189.11365700352732
then though yourself a servant you have other servants to wait upon you take car	181.7368838582129
again you make a profit upon each article you purchase for my toilet amounting i	264.8509900210283
nay indeed your excellency	56.74821979688551
i am not condemning you for this monsieur baptistin but let your profits end her	133.32844428495937
it would be long indeed ere you would find so lucrative a post as that you have 	59.89638071871833
i neither illuse nor illtreat my servants by word or action	368.288604559294
an error i readily forgive but wilful negligence or forgetfulness never	572.8987282048233
my commands are ordinarily short clear and precise and i would rather be obliged	145.80668731423233
i am rich enough to know whatever i desire to know and i can promise you i am no	43.78691471606194
if then i should learn that you had taken upon yourself to speak of me to anyone	86.91362407369917
you may now retire	356.3352977350786
i never caution my servants a second timeremember that	185.60644054560595
baptistin bowed and was proceeding towards the door	52.64739964975658
i forgot to mention to you said the count that i lay yearly aside a certain sum 	56.3328930322858
you have been in my service a year your fund has already begun to accumulatelet 	57.83509259856577
this address delivered in the presence of ali who not understanding one word of 	66.15092521640537
baptistin only to be conceived by such as have occasion to study the character a	121.98671712494144
i assure your excellency said he that at least it shall be my study to merit you	44.5065944978484
ali as my model	296.1021054548366
by no means replied the count in the most frigid tones ali has many faults mixed	40.25412981157219
he can not possibly serve you as a pattern for your conduct not being as you are	93.81507610402483
baptistin opened his eyes with astonishment	21.503887406814638
you seem incredulous said monte cristo who repeated to ali in the arabic languag	34.02889433780878
the nubian smiled assentingly to his masters words then kneeling on one knee res	76.45620417327585
this corroboration of the lesson he had just received put the finishing stroke t	145.19613998083483
the count then motioned the valet de chambre to retire and to ali to follow to h	24.41362929163403
as the hand of the clock pointed to five the count struck thrice upon his gong	118.37573877040431
when ali was wanted one stroke was given two summoned baptistin and three bertuc	147.88545574280295
the steward entered	341.91993680623204
my horses said monte cristo	31.57472047096971
they are at the door harnessed to the carriage as your excellency desired	51.13854933045381
does your excellency wish me to accompany him	13.370821043084504
no the coachman ali and baptistin will go	39.7460654103492
the count descended to the door of his mansion and beheld his carriage drawn by 	40.762157352533585
as he passed them he said	64.4363263252928
they are extremely handsome certainly and you have done well to purchase them al	85.81879881353157
indeed your excellency i had very considerable difficulty in obtaining them and 	106.57535879630551
does the sum you gave for them make the animals less beautiful inquired the coun	185.85707607238268
nay if your excellency is satisfied it is all that i could wish	33.85235800871512
whither does your excellency desire to be driven	32.10387489429811
to the residence of baron danglars rue de la chausse dantin	22.654580099393744
this conversation had passed as they stood upon the terrace from which a flight 	98.6486135824621
as bertuccio with a respectful bow was moving away the count called him back	95.17274667624699
i have another commission for you m	86.0655007151175
bertuccio said he i am desirous of having an estate by the seaside in normandyfo	36.1564580102135
you see i give you a wide range	101.00557607993487
it will be absolutely necessary that the place you may select have a small harbo	66.03910449155204
she draws only fifteen feet	724.2215203541532
she must be kept in constant readiness to sail immediately i think proper to giv	100.32703037865292
make the requisite inquiries for a place of this description and when you have m	90.33592941326937
the corvette must now i think be on her way to fcamp must she not	175.56339824816246
20333 m	1.1311594240006044
certainly your excellency i saw her put to sea the same evening we quitted marse	77.95699300179697
and the yacht	187.985681018772
was ordered to remain at martigues	72.35642763746318
tis well	12.880909311585151
i wish you to write from time to time to the captains in charge of the two vesse	55.08076191211201
and the steamboat	158.89801432081572
she is at chlons	16.200421803120374
the same orders for her as for the two sailing vessels	159.00048632999625
very good	14.98050482804993
when you have purchased the estate i desire i want constant relays of horses at 	184.05063585460638
your excellency may depend upon me	43.01432760648178
the count made a gesture of satisfaction descended the terrace steps and sprang 	91.24601693026895
danglars was engaged at that moment presiding over a railroad committee	155.35672357869745
but the meeting was nearly concluded when the name of his visitor was announced	61.78667610054073
as the counts title sounded on his ear he rose and addressing his colleagues who	94.99143737163386
gentlemen pardon me for leaving you so abruptly but a most ridiculous circumstan	163.04684184519863
i confess this is the drollest thing i have ever met with in the course of my ex	31.42984626230266
i took the trouble this morning to call on the pretended countif he were a real 	134.73646902350472
but would you believe it he was not receiving	80.43387644402975
so the master of monte cristo gives himself airs befitting a great millionaire o	46.72604418694293
i made inquiries and found that the house in the champslyses is his own property	86.08811630102406
but pursued danglars with one of his sinister smiles an order for unlimited cred	45.86016197585464
i am very anxious to see this man	20.208504196230628
i suspect a hoax is intended but the instigators of it little knew whom they had	181.306266805294
they laugh best who laugh last	4697.574353372958
having delivered himself of this pompous address uttered with a degree of energy	123.51143844314
it was to this apartment he had desired his guest to be shown with the purpose o	47.87347083806198
he found the count standing before some copies of albano and fattore that had be	90.7944218908088
the count turned round as he heard the entrance of danglars into the room	31.565040946959606
with a slight inclination of the head danglars signed to the count to be seated 	49.45870441979731
the count sat down	35.00230657323947
20335 m	1.2719740937498856
i have the honor i presume of addressing m	58.233803344113554
de monte cristo	3.3917383027083483
the count bowed	24.31253056401316
and i of speaking to baron danglars chevalier of the legion of honor and member 	105.45825440149135
monte cristo repeated all the titles he had read on the barons card	81.09001125478825
danglars felt the irony and compressed his lips	69.98039969732116
you will i trust excuse me monsieur for not calling you by your title when i fir	125.14392007279574
so much so replied monte cristo that while you call yourself baron you are not w	49.406823819897625
upon my word monsieur said danglars with affected carelessness i attach no sort 	58.183287432077954
but you have discarded your titles after the example set you by messrs	155.3932492420483
de montmorency and lafayette that was a noble example to follow monsieur	57.88356730940354
why replied danglars not entirely so with the servantsyou understand	249.61753485839787
i see to your domestics you are my lord the journalists style you monsieur while	194.14156108210162
these are distinctions very suitable under a constitutional government	152.51452335995847
i understand perfectly	466.7258029643156
again danglars bit his lips he saw that he was no match for monte cristo in an a	27.789106426658194
permit me to inform you count said he bowing that i have received a letter of ad	36.93554075362177
i am glad to hear it baronfor i must claim the privilege of addressing you after	65.09607266482871
i have acquired the bad habit of calling persons by their titles from living in 	211.76806403040226
but as regards the letter of advice i am charmed to find that it has reached you	73.1962177270681
you have received a regular letter of advice	107.1180608542298
yes said danglars but i confess i did nt quite comprehend its meaning	65.370392805528
and for that reason i did myself the honor of calling upon you in order to beg f	45.50565131894166
go on monsieur	27.027863741110124
here i am ready to give you any explanation you desire	24.116675440410905
why said danglars in the letteri believe i have it about mehere he felt in his b	69.52698526300549
well this letter gives the count of monte cristo unlimited credit on our house	87.87178079211363
well baron what is there difficult to understand about that	157.48766735783653
merely the term unlimitednothing else certainly	1192.6327907291845
is not that word known in france the people who wrote are anglogermans you know	112.09193060253965
oh as for the composition of the letter there is nothing to be said but as regar	43.477663108463005
is it possible asked the count assuming all air and tone of the utmost simplicit	51.02718364352402
is it possible that thomson   french are not looked upon as safe and solvent ban	46.28206249957981
thomson   french are perfectly solvent replied danglars with an almost mocking s	72.30007294548219
is in fact unlimited said monte cristo	22.553811877387922
precisely what i was about to say cried danglars	31.469601705484276
now what is vague is doubtful and it was a wise man who said when in doubt keep 	128.7910714430805
meaning to say rejoined monte cristo that however thomson   french may be inclin	50.759957774191506
not at all	15.551644275216878
plainly enough messrs	144.06346683635942
thomson   french set no bounds to their engagements while those of m	186.45375940611214
danglars have their limits he is a wise man according to his own showing	203.09570292821854
monsieur replied the banker drawing himself up with a haughty air the extent of 	40.579452898720184
it seems then reserved for me said monte cristo coldly to be the first to do so	34.524974427602615
by what right sir	170.86640865245548
by right of the objections you have raised and the explanations you have demande	62.227552195339925
once more danglars bit his lips	48.257034723337966
it was the second time he had been worsted and this time on his own ground	29.416122872868712
his forced politeness sat awkwardly upon him and approached almost to impertinen	150.25142056950895
monte cristo on the contrary preserved a graceful suavity of demeanor aided by a	91.47001723568196
well sir resumed danglars after a brief silence i will endeavor to make myself u	32.78100037106302
why truly replied monte cristo determined not to lose an inch of the ground he h	55.9135134995308
the banker thought the time had come for him to take the upper hand	54.85689253860104
so throwing himself back in his armchair he said with an arrogant and purseproud	87.9328510765588
let me beg of you not to hesitate in naming your wishes you will then be convinc	36.6584528612272
i beg your pardon interposed monte cristo	18.58815761585433
i said a million replied danglars with the confidence of ignorance	68.67009804505285
but could i do with a million retorted the count	49.42966955988813
my dear sir if a trifle like that could suffice me i should never have given mys	66.41420276238455
a million excuse my smiling when you speak of a sum i am in the habit of carryin	68.04028294269742
and with these words monte cristo took from his pocket a small case containing h	32.978467700773976
a man like danglars was wholly inaccessible to any gentler method of correction	113.0029733462176
the effect of the present revelation was stunning he trembled and was on the ver	72.70532465000137
the pupils of his eyes as he gazed at monte cristo dilated horribly	85.04277243323513
come come said monte cristo confess honestly that you have not perfect confidenc	44.08360699191465
i understand and foreseeing that such might be the case i took in spite of my ig	44.54754071625746
see here are two similar letters to that you have yourself received one from the	175.33525539212624
now sir you have but to say the word and i will spare you all uneasiness by pres	71.9658164384878
the blow had struck home and danglars was entirely vanquished with a trembling h	92.4385935838601
oh sir said danglars after he had convinced himself of the authenticity of the d	30.03870753432072
nay answered monte cristo with the most gentlemanly air tis not for such triflin	31.179108999683912
then you can let me have some money can you not	60.04702825075119
whatever you say my dear count i am at your orders	23.453399879825785
why replied monte cristo since we mutually understand each otherfor such i presu	86.23799706862125
you are quite sure that not a lurking doubt or suspicion lingers in your mind	67.18457712647617
oh my dear count exclaimed danglars i never for an instant entertained such a fe	25.159497568785763
no you merely wished to be convinced nothing more but now that we have come to s	67.31265124025768
six millions gasped danglarsso be it	87.79279191534233
then if i should require more continued monte cristo in a careless manner why of	80.33781907169315
however we shall see	17.770209333159524
be kind enough then to send me 500000 francs tomorrow	72.23842282349538
i shall be at home till midday or if not i will leave a receipt with my steward	55.94159525684879
the money you desire shall be at your house by ten oclock tomorrow morning my de	103.22468852725457
how would you like to have it in gold silver or notes	84.91679105798946
half in gold and the other half in banknotes if you please said the count rising	107.57690282761159
i must confess to you count said danglars that i have hitherto imagined myself a	41.89609134722842
may i presume to ask whether you have long possessed it	87.73244641256129
it has been in the family a very long while returned monte cristo a sort of trea	57.7487830151077
the period appointed by the testator for the disposal of these riches occurred o	126.85682178477279
your ignorance on the subject therefore is easily accounted for	223.22532053449913
however you will be better informed as to me and my possessions ere long	92.14035805617715
and the count while pronouncing these latter words accompanied them with one of 	209.8217086024398
with your tastes and means of gratifying them continued danglars you will exhibi	78.99475262281148
if i mistake not you are an admirer of paintings at least i judged so from the a	83.93936718104725
if you will permit me i shall be happy to show you my picture gallery composed e	78.99720105692316
not a modern picture among them	502.76497489606487
i can not endure the modern school of painting	85.4114529870483
you are perfectly right in objecting to them for this one great faultthat they h	106.23571814566634
or will you allow me to show you several fine statues by thorwaldsen bartoloni a	87.49218813805727
you have a right to be unjust to them monsieur they are your compatriots	71.66600631935407
but all this may come later when we shall be better known to each other	67.17990001827056
for the present i will confine myself if perfectly agreeable to you to introduci	77.76860625034702
monte cristo bowed in sign that he accepted the proffered honor danglars rang an	168.05670186547766
is the baroness at home inquired danglars	122.5140979355344

nay madame	113.01649904380703
this time i have merely come from cadiz	62.575063004259185
you have selected a most unfavorable moment for your first visit	113.36819541163115
paris is a horrible place in summer	164.24173561525274
balls parties and ftes are over the italian opera is in london the french opera 	86.988047263099
as for the thatre franais you know of course that it is nowhere	26.987676986944802

at this instant the favorite attendant of madame danglars entered the boudoir ap	41.3168071151576
madame danglars turned very pale then exclaimed	100.3086616324874
i can not believe it the thing is impossible	33.12567010349877
i assure you madame replied the woman it is as i have said	22.561265974341016
turning impatiently towards her husband madame danglars demanded is this true	184.93132342036748
is what true madame inquired danglars visibly agitated	93.08588912164706
what my maid tells me	237.16728490510152
but what does she tell you	32.603933340619925
that when my coachman was about to harness the horses to my carriage he discover	135.54667730121244
i desire to know what is the meaning of this	25.781376384553226
be kind enough madame to listen to me said danglars	39.3338051676159
oh yes i will listen monsieur for i am most curious to hear what explanation you	57.498165567956725
these two gentlemen shall decide between us but first i will state the case to t	184.20516212795442
gentlemen continued the baroness among the ten horses in the stables of baron da	110.91467535357488
but to you at least m	94.20004381103256
debray i need not give a further description because to you my beautiful pair of	129.87474327606768
well i had promised madame de villefort the loan of my carriage to drive tomorro	36.03735728414859
no doubt m	391.45910694957263
danglars has sacrificed them to the selfish consideration of gaining some thousa	176.0168818918721
oh what a detestable crew they are these mercenary speculators	153.57619890138633
madame replied danglars the horses were not sufficiently quiet for you they were	51.51935043781145
nonsense retorted the baroness you could not have entertained any alarm on the s	54.45096788285896
but perhaps you have disposed of the coachman as well as the horses	62.699282859015725
my dear love pray do not say any more about them and i promise you another pair 	91.48851241779295
the baroness shrugged her shoulders with an air of ineffable contempt while her 	30.64486421370267
you are setting up an establishment of course	71.43506209329747
why yes replied the count	22.463713707596284
i should have liked to have made you the offer of these horses	51.43023949284893
i have almost given them away as it is but as i before said i was anxious to get	48.45333489639074
they were only fit for a young man	33.32193239869019
i am much obliged by your kind intentions towards me said monte cristo but this 	54.77980738340173
there they are	20.146556884666047
come m	552.4545176505057
debray you are a connoisseur i believe let me have your opinion upon them	124.43878587262414
as debray walked towards the window danglars approached his wife	63.36387050526698
i could not tell you before others said he in a low tone the reason of my partin	30.73657108046058
some madman or fool bent upon ruining himself as fast as he can actually sent hi	304.92652285990863
come do nt look so angry and you shall have 4000 francs of the money to do what 	43.705728119148624
there what do you think now of the affair was nt i right to part with the horses	148.1593160511902
madame danglars surveyed her husband with a look of withering contempt	27.61918202918529
great heavens suddenly exclaimed debray	160.11754216519782
what is it asked the baroness	13.037478593470853
i can not be mistaken there are your horses the very animals we were speaking of	60.49648811731898
my dappled grays demanded the baroness springing to the window	66.9249788415293
tis indeed they said she	103.21582906138296
danglars looked absolutely stupefied	1039.0425420569052
how very singular cried monte cristo with wellfeigned astonishment	41.155826272560425
i can not believe it murmured the banker	29.96140259511619
madame danglars whispered a few words in the ear of debray who approached monte 	20.07159209323223
i scarcely know replied the count it was a little surprise prepared for me by my	65.06569137518423
debray conveyed the counts reply to the baroness	57.63678957864676
poor danglars looked so crestfallen and discomfited that monte cristo assumed a 	68.91037054505784
see said the count how very ungrateful women are	62.787212763541945
your kind attention in providing for the safety of the baroness by disposing of 	138.18642083193672
but so it is a woman will often from mere wilfulness prefer that which is danger	232.23396264313553
therefore in my opinion my dear baron the best and easiest way is to leave them 	77.15954284197943
danglars made no reply he was occupied in anticipations of the coming scene betw	67.54047648944542

excellent murmured monte cristo to himself as he came away	38.632236354356735
all has gone according to my wishes	219.3474381116734
the domestic peace of this family is henceforth in my hands	146.59808700604464

but he went on with his peculiar smile i am here in paris and have plenty of tim	43.64736158266055
with these reflections he entered his carriage and returned home	90.9669396107569
two hours afterwards madame danglars received a most flattering epistle from the	36.526619494811555
the horses were sent back wearing the same harness she had seen on them in the m	112.47909172716173
to danglars monte cristo also wrote requesting him to excuse the whimsical gift 	153.01561721308292
during the evening monte cristo quitted paris for auteuil accompanied by ali	31.470382020681647
the following day about three oclock a single blow struck on the gong summoned a	55.557916320188625
ali observed his master as the nubian entered the chamber you have frequently ex	82.43508594119233
ali drew himself up proudly and then returned a sign in the affirmative	51.19682551081334
i thought i did not mistake	49.30657605954479
with your lasso you could stop an ox	254.7021574358337
again ali repeated his affirmative gesture	182.15410468843868
or a tiger	166.556168928866
ali bowed his head in token of assent	9.78753202202567
a lion even	2182.8880732599373
ali sprung forwards imitating the action of one throwing the lasso then of a str	170.88229710440712
i understand said monte cristo you wish to tell me you have hunted the lion	39.698968191618796
ali smiled with triumphant pride as he signified that he had indeed both chased 	145.21476536741426
but do you believe you could arrest the progress of two horses rushing forwards 	93.67766294164262
the nubian smiled	50.031054841350304
it is well said monte cristo	6.037304628387293
then listen to me	34.921984525449346
ere long a carriage will dash past here drawn by the pair of dappled gray horses	238.11596819331973
ali descended to the street and marked a straight line on the pavement immediate	105.08528742545437
the count patted him gently on the shoulder his usual mode of praising ali who p	45.49840450169144

in the vehicle was a young woman and a child of about seven or eight clasped in 	76.54623340634191
terror seemed to have deprived them even of the power of uttering a cry	86.07260079454528
the carriage creaked and rattled as it flew over the rough stones and the slight	68.552972897549
ali suddenly cast aside his chibouque drew the lasso from his pocket threw it so	126.36484486437766
gladly availing himself of this opportunity the coachman leaped from his box but	126.0204730024982
all this was achieved in much less time than is occupied in the recital	140.1469235353246
the brief space had however been sufficient for a man followed by a number of se	58.24066245423503

de villefort had the reputation of being the least curious and the least weariso	48.80593642463952
he gave a ball every year at which he appeared for a quarter of an hour onlythat	49.182417134572184
he was never seen at the theatres at concerts or in any place of public resort	124.98254833398022
occasionally but seldom he played at whist and then care was taken to select par	215.89312982790298
such was the man whose carriage had just now stopped before the count of monte c	50.56875438489285
the valet de chambre announced m	30.957853788543257
de villefort at the moment when the count leaning over a large table was tracing	37.04844008132092
petersburg to china	408.3084820230486
the procureur entered with the same grave and measured step he would have employ	123.3832320603829
he was the same man or rather the development of the same man whom we have heret	27.053484113440796

he dressed entirely in black with the exception of his white tie and his funeral	72.60042387740525
although master of himself monte cristo scrutinized with irrepressible curiosity	183.05582911970026
sir said villefort in the squeaky tone assumed by magistrates in their oratorica	55.62116239228855
i have come therefore to discharge this duty and to express to you my overwhelmi	56.614621406151805
and as he said this the eye severe of the magistrate had lost nothing of its hab	100.32741309663136
he spoke in a voice of the procureurgeneral with the rigid inflexibility of neck	67.75091434086401
monsieur replied the count with a chilling air i am very happy to have been the 	17.16445083539803
de villefort is not usually lavish of the favor which he now bestows on mea favo	135.88766039948464
villefort astonished at this reply which he by no means expected started like a 	184.61141114552757
he glanced around in order to seize on something on which the conversation might	74.35502393672108
he saw the map which monte cristo had been examining when he entered and said	55.653475859691284
you seem geographically engaged sir it is a rich study for you who as i learn ha	183.3249605441085
yes sir replied the count i have sought to make of the human race taken in the m	46.25814587750203

it is an algebraic axiom which makes us proceed from a known to an unknown quant	93.91967893613388
monte cristo pointed to a chair which the procureur was obliged to take the trou	31.856767134107272
villefort entered	262.5073604370929
thus the count was halfway turned towards his visitor having his back towards th	98.98551874655062
ah you philosophize replied villefort after a moments silence during which like 	44.4019427497458
why in truth sir was monte cristos reply man is but an ugly caterpillar for him 	100.02699902232177
now really let me ask sir have youdo you believe you have anything to do or to s	122.60058897709328
villeforts astonishment redoubled at this second thrust so forcibly made by his 	294.3590109378899
it was a long time since the magistrate had heard a paradox so strong or rather 	45.97165921583088
the procureur exerted himself to reply	134.5280192738335
sir he responded you are a stranger and i believe you say yourself that a portio	41.244861252030226
oh yesyes i do sir it is the pede claudo of the ancients	64.09238301785447

if this law were adopted sir said the procureur it would greatly simplify our le	169.88136910920616
it may perhaps come to this in time observed monte cristo you know that human in	113.37787223669781
in the meanwhile continued the magistrate our codes are in full force with all t	79.79187729310425

the english turkish japanese hindu laws are as familiar to me as the french laws	51.96912219728832
but with what motive have you learned all this inquired villefort in astonishmen	61.69596976083099
monte cristo smiled	34.79092095245418
really sir he observed i see that in spite of the reputation which you have acqu	36.56739860491132
pray sir explain yourself said villefort more and more astonished i really donot	74.39368019145361
i say sir that with the eyes fixed on the social organization of nations you see	71.91165190683134
it is thus that human weakness fails from its debilitated and imperfect organs	202.12272934577345

the nations took attila who was doomed to destroy them for a conqueror similar t	64.14081092616793
then said villefort more and more amazed and really supposing he was speaking to	99.40871900884012
and why not said monte cristo coldly	33.75900022340833
your pardon sir replied villefort quite astounded but you will excuse me if when	44.98363391124643
it is not usual with us corrupted wretches of civilization to find gentlemen lik	102.21759297241421
really sir retorted the count have you attained the eminent situation in which y	60.94448799987947
sir said villefort upon my word you overcome me	32.54817595173941
i really never heard a person speak as you do	106.00325396377406
because you remain eternally encircled in a round of general conditions and have	289.1771263686172
and you allow then sir that spheres exist and that these marked and invisible be	290.1690145515037
why should they not can you see the air you breathe and yet without which you co	101.43388196100149
then we do not see those beings to whom you allude	66.49665601569558
yes we do you see them whenever god pleases to allow them to assume a material f	130.2460425636551
you touch them come in contact with them speak to them and they reply to you	183.44484727349416

you have been served as you desire monsieur for you were warned just now and i n	87.1928630928377

that is to say replied villefort with hesitation that human nature being weak ev	39.8427072894645

but let us leave off this strain sir if the tone of it is displeasing to you i a	62.20153493292375
no noby no means said villefort who was afraid of seeming to abandon his ground	111.90463950768562
no by your brilliant and almost sublime conversation you have elevated me above 	302.8576929097568
but you know how the theologians in their collegiate chairs and philosophers in 	101.36536844197947

above us all sir was monte cristos response in a tone and with an emphasis so de	97.01918411867398
i have my pride for menserpents always ready to threaten everyone who would pass	269.58873716769745
but i lay aside that pride before god who has taken me from nothing to make me w	87.98435576573485
then count i admire you said villefort who for the first time in this strange co	40.45803115927381
yes and i say to you if you are really strong really superior really pious or im	97.71248525566546
yet you have unquestionably some ambition	369.0096768960348
i have sir	144.13946333861236
and what may it be	18.43631528397648
i too as happens to every man once in his life have been taken by satan into the	101.04295764798141
i wish to be providence myself for i feel that the most beautiful noblest most s	80.72885862354394
satan bowed his head and groaned	18.214102722767368
you mistake he said providence does exist only you have never seen him because t	128.1570193234583
you have seen nothing that resembles him because he works by secret springs and 	147.34684074818932
all i can do for you is to make you one of the agents of that providence	48.4242898845099
the bargain was concluded	442.3401528095116
i may sacrifice my soul but what matters it added monte cristo	76.82168298557251
if the thing were to do again i would again do it	82.9731146874268
villefort looked at monte cristo with extreme amazement	33.2087639694482
count he inquired have you any relations	93.9473149716728
no sir i am alone in the world	16.22405036739376
so much the worse	5.144242151297615
why asked monte cristo	11.266363376785144
because then you might witness a spectacle calculated to break down your pride	331.01781113023236
you say you fear nothing but death	355.4926730173669
i did not say that i feared it i only said that death alone could check the exec	48.34107403234354
and old age	695.1714172717301
my end will be achieved before i grow old	473.79679274815095
and madness	7631.339408329753

in contrast with the old man who is dragging his way to the tomb are two childre	37.71789244461187
and what is your deduction from this compensation sir inquired monte cristo	40.0311033005309
my deduction is replied villefort that my father led away by his passions has co	74.32996130807697
that god desirous in his mercy to punish but one person has visited this justice	375.2554745491209
monte cristo with a smile on his lips uttered in the depths of his soul a groan 	25.55983336151021
adieu sir said the magistrate who had risen from his seat i leave you bearing a 	43.93359631823735
besides you have made an eternal friend of madame de villefort	25.279464585389498
the count bowed and contented himself with seeing villefort to the door of his c	58.988584417430815
when he had gone monte cristo breathed a profound sigh and said	57.36433340451298
enough of this poison let me now seek the antidote	191.1990385162255
then sounding his bell he said to ali who entered	84.37492914659164

even ali who had hastened to obey the counts summons went forth from his masters	89.46934096446907
it was noon and monte cristo had set apart one hour to be passed in the apartmen	44.04906249985482
the young greek as we have already said occupied apartments wholly unconnected w	129.71432219737318
the rooms had been fitted up in strict accordance with oriental ideas the floors	71.2241500730641
hayde had three french maids and one who was a greek	52.23260071892067
the first three remained constantly in a small waitingroom ready to obey the sum	88.89033267483997
the young girl herself generally passed her time in the chamber at the farther e	144.62152247031608
this was a sort of boudoir circular and lighted only from the roof which consist	68.89867372488405

her attitude though perfectly natural for an eastern woman would in a european h	119.3365452367874
her dress which was that of the women of epirus consisted of a pair of white sat	67.0959916829808
she wore a blue and whitestriped vest with long open sleeves trimmed with silver	146.3576070055659
the junction of the bodice and drawers was entirely concealed by one of the many	64.3017351764363
tilted on one side of her head she had a small cap of goldcolored silk embroider	46.68915075661967
the extreme beauty of the countenance that shone forth in loveliness that mocked	107.65572336590695
and to complete the whole hayde was in the very springtide and fulness of youthf	53.83526705522687
monte cristo summoned the greek attendant and bade her inquire whether it would 	102.70685400663048
haydes only reply was to direct her servant by a sign to withdraw the tapestried	133.6690736106201
as monte cristo approached she leaned upon the elbow of the arm that held the na	62.219481823424665
why demand permission ere you enter are you no longer my master or have i ceased	299.6704733529134
monte cristo returned her smile	109.18442922098507
hayde said he you well know	48.41057606929955
why do you address me so coldlyso distantly asked the young greek	88.59065978652913
have i by any means displeased you oh if so punish me as you will but do notdo n	93.73083412463863
hayde replied the count you know that you are now in france and are free	22.406864674731
free to do what asked the young girl	14.737406447523583
free to leave me	54.23086067782389

i do nt wish to see anybody but you	38.50229976667629

i have never seen anyone i preferred to you and i have never loved anyone but yo	34.619096797086506
my poor child replied monte cristo that is merely because your father and myself	53.176603053609774
i do nt want anybody else to talk to me	43.60479959678315
my father said i was his joyyou style me your loveand both of you have called me	144.01792937314832
do you remember your father hayde	19.04517563117228
the young greek smiled	51.332727132178114
he is here and here said she touching her eyes and her heart	45.17816390317385
and where am i inquired monte cristo laughingly	75.78373716826005
you cried she with tones of thrilling tenderness you are everywhere monte cristo	92.41933343633252
you now understand hayde said the count that from this moment you are absolutely	58.585069055493115
within this mansion you are absolute mistress of your actions and may go abroad 	124.86716355082775
a carriage waits your orders and ali and myrtho will accompany you whithersoever	72.86633029764569
there is but one favor i would entreat of you	94.15792007198625

a rapid change took place in the young mans feelings	95.16221865731646

outwardly and in the eyes of the world i am surrounded by kindness and affection	60.85623680542401
the general remark is oh it can not be expected that one of so stern a character	166.53425040421845
villefort could lavish the tenderness some fathers do on their daughters	971.8434545312758

dear maximilian believe me when i assure you that if i do not attempt to resist 	34.591952324495246
but why valentine do you persist in anticipating the worstwhy picture so gloomy 	127.15272071419092
because i judge it from the past	80.35038509715528

now it is you who are unjust maximilian cried valentine but there is one thing i	30.081206961350055
and what is that inquired the young man perceiving that valentine hesitated	18.098726895100686

though it certainly does cost france somewhat dear to assert her rights in that 	401.7498302995235
brutal politics i must confess	245.88729382316896

the name of monte cristo sent an electric shock through the young man on the oth	24.946837122313834

but melancholy interrupted master edward snatching the feathers out of the tail 	203.76424680339824
madame de villefort merely cried be still edward she then added this young madca	149.3722620536986
but what detains her go edward and see	216.078305865167

madame de villefort at this really did turn pale and was very nearly angry with 	181.56451444284127
but madame replied the count continuing the conversation and looking by turns at	63.10732842232315
i do not think it likely sir mademoiselle de villefort is not very fond of socie	31.675651252005053

i do not recollect now all the various subjects of which we discoursed madame co	73.77072489611196
yes really sir you were in fact a medical man said madame de villefort since you	37.676665723343255
molire or beaumarchais would reply to you madame that it was precisely because i	62.17582502502302
at this moment the clock struck six	10.861527571254495
it is six oclock said madame de villefort evidently agitated	24.671439436152756
valentine will you not go and see if your grandpapa will have his dinner	65.16750434863138
valentine rose and saluting the count left the apartment without speaking	78.16991160300073

the count followed her with his eyes	36.53422291544987

madame de villefort closed the door carefully after the child the count appearin	34.256347949107266

and your precautions were successful	277.8237668393908
completely so	157.11952727869195
yes i remember now your mentioning to me at perugia something of this sort	105.91236017866362

true sir	32.42757533650022
the two favorite studies of my youth were botany and mineralogy and subsequently	147.23692416353262
and the more madame said monte cristo as the orientals do not confine themselves	64.11426888065023

oh yes indeed madame continued monte cristo the secret dramas of the east begin 	85.22589737442972
there are as many elixirs of every kind as there are caprices and peculiarities 	71.05115267316062
but sir remarked the young woman these eastern societies in the midst of which y	45.783491923682085

there disguised under other names and concealed under other costumes are police 	484.2911758819518

now replied the count shrugging his shoulders shall i tell you the cause of all 	21.320763616342695
five minutes afterwards the curtain falls and the spectators depart	62.64328025461588
they are ignorant of the consequences of the murder they see neither the police 	84.96300440872561

thus for instance the excellent abb adelmonte of whom i spoke just now made in t	84.7591422747997
yes i will mention one to you	58.286141839836
he had a remarkably fine garden full of vegetables flowers and fruit	102.15527205188387
from amongst these vegetables he selected the most simplea cabbage for instance	260.47519329760127
for three days he watered this cabbage with a distillation of arsenic on the thi	54.72845137077648
at that moment he cut it	63.66093625394885
in the eyes of everybody it seemed fit for table and preserved its wholesome app	138.11850244305526
it was only poisoned to the abb adelmonte	30.08657920805906
he then took the cabbage to the room where he had rabbitsfor the abb adelmonte h	21.955530354046722
well the abb adelmonte took a rabbit and made it eat a leaf of the cabbage	76.91720383658955
the rabbit died	1601.315963006393

to be a great chemist in the east one must direct chance and this is to be achie	52.79529521648393
madame de villefort was in deep thought yet listened attentively	101.54344498351286
but she exclaimed suddenly arsenic is indelible indestructible in whatsoever way	204.4496142227092
precisely so cried monte cristoprecisely so and this is what i said to my worthy	57.63629488023667
he reflected smiled and replied to me by a sicilian proverb which i believe is a	97.83188267274106
return on sunday	59.22920213377362
on the sunday following i did return to him	64.99588990362892
instead of having watered his cabbage with arsenic he had watered it this time w	96.3585503692677
now the cabbage had not the slightest appearance of disease in the world and the	44.733678509407625

apoplexy is a rare disease among fowls i believe but very common among men	280.1938918491193
madame de villefort appeared more and more thoughtful	41.88330762556055
it is very fortunate she observed that such substances could only be prepared by	72.31451956500722
by chemists and persons who have a taste for chemistry said monte cristo careles	64.20905113131732

oh no in the first place let us agree that the word poison does not exist becaus	50.78442204617159
what then is it	34.269271133514444
a skilful preparation of my friends the worthy abb adelmonte who taught me the u	88.42627476296532
oh observed madame de villefort it must be an admirable antispasmodic	38.70933257642218

undoubtedly and so should i prefer it after the effects i have seen produced but	152.16308731080764
but i said monte cristo rising as he spokei am gallant enough to offer it you	66.61789125042347
30079 m	1.2872911687154074
how kind you are	42.15644612225326
only remember one thinga small dose is a remedy a large one is poison	444.5315819362618
one drop will restore life as you have seen five or six will inevitably kill and	112.92853016647787
but i say no more madame it is really as if i were prescribing for you	33.908950904683934
the clock struck halfpast six and a lady was announced a friend of madame de vil	59.084494225222386
if i had had the honor of seeing you for the third or fourth time count instead 	77.76367437289704
a thousand thanks madame replied monte cristo but i have an engagement which i c	36.50055517619268
i have promised to escort to the acadmie a greek princess of my acquaintance who	39.21870999652503
adieu then sir and do not forget the prescription	53.23222642697192
ah in truth madame to do that i must forget the hours conversation i have had wi	98.21548832468723
monte cristo bowed and left the house	33.078057076734844
madame de villefort remained immersed in thought	55.58091620413932
he is a very strange man she said and in my opinion is himself the adelmonte he 	55.38609003172075
as to monte cristo the result had surpassed his utmost expectations	65.8093140510663

the curtain rose as usual to an almost empty house it being one of the absurditi	77.67173177701437
surely said albert as the door of a box on the first circle opened that must be 	37.03614653468924
and who is the countess g inquired chteaurenaud	19.609593399324986
what a question now do you know baron i have a great mind to pick a quarrel with	86.06213556414772
ah to be sure replied chteaurenaud the lovely venetian is it not	29.82063164244726
at this moment the countess perceived albert and returned his salutation with a 	18.621949458048284
you know her it seems said chteaurenaud	33.012255205222196
franz introduced me to her at rome replied albert	44.28274308864724
well then will you do as much for me in paris as franz did for you in rome	27.89689217969317
with pleasure	259.88688212361546
there was a cry of shut up from the audience	47.001518545168544
this manifestation on the part of the spectators of their wish to be allowed to 	37.58318094030167
the countess was present at the races in the champdemars said chteaurenaud	51.10565268160478
bless me i quite forgot the races	168.80345761617278
did you bet	69.83929010059855
oh merely a paltry fifty louis	308.56945173574223
and who was the winner	38.12387662097413
i staked on him	217.23257867451701
but there were three races were there not	126.87714806863022

what was it	14.830297270429865
oh shut up again interposed some of the audience	203.11807502681052
why it was won by a horse and rider utterly unknown on the course	120.39570772818544
is that possible	56.91222138395357
true as day	323.3201895918191
the fact was nobody had observed a horse entered by the name of vampa or that of	72.46280714216843
they were obliged to stuff at least twenty pounds weight of shot in the small ri	64.99155110469246
and was it not found out at last to whom the horse and jockey belonged	129.71388922983434
you say that the horse was entered under the name of vampa	51.18392510435407
exactly that was the title	51.42533495687005
then answered albert i am better informed than you are and know who the owner of	103.17356019320103

and this time the tone and manner in which the command was given betokened such 	108.32751736840463
leisurely turning round they calmly scrutinized the various countenances around 	666.5748543614759

now barring all that i mean to say she is a deuced fine girl	80.33575046322927
handsome certainly replied albert but not to my taste which i confess inclines t	106.61103976992976

it was rumored that she was an object of almost paternal interest to one of the 	38.95143474009873

so we meet again my travelling friend do we cried the countess extending her han	160.61918229353344
be assured replied albert that if i had been aware of your arrival in paris and 	24.146794768163776
allow me to introduce my friend baron de chteaurenaud one of the few true gentle	78.41189751500758
chteaurenaud bowed to the countess	40.47564849181679
so you were at the races baron inquired the countess eagerly	46.544264998527986
yes madame	42.65178657900407
well then pursued madame g with considerable animation you can probably tell me 	102.28599968060487
i am sorry to say i can not replied the baron and i was just asking the same que	31.00418159567317
are you very anxious to know countess asked albert	48.536327405527786
to know what	102.10934749968365
the name of the owner of the winning horse	45.07509247342053
excessively only imaginebut do tell me viscount whether you really are acquainte	200.83354007141602
i beg your pardon madame but you were about to relate some story were you not yo	50.59740881687244
pray continue	2387.6609797491333
well then listen	78.48558984330978
you must know i felt so interested in the splendid roan horse with his elegant l	102.82583281881713
imagine my surprise when upon returning home the first object i met on the stair	212.86713300705725
inside the cup was a small piece of paper on which were written these wordsfrom 	56.46076493042238
precisely i was sure of it said morcerf	14.357915535895785
sure of what	20.198995538417094
that the owner of the horse was lord ruthven himself	57.380364763396095
what lord ruthven do you mean	26.005775881629727
why our lord ruthventhe vampire of the salle argentina	45.95803733577911
is it possible exclaimed the countess is he here in paris	30.15079038050183
to be surewhy not	135.38060589631178
and you visit himmeet him at your own house and elsewhere	149.38023960615496
i assure you he is my most intimate friend and m	52.61372054150018
de chteaurenaud has also the honor of his acquaintance	28.656397607913757
but why are you so sure of his being the winner of the jockey club prize	79.14269878462528
was not the winning horse entered by the name of vampa	46.46843433510829
what of that	140.069959671633
why do you not recollect the name of the celebrated bandit by whom i was made pr	29.661209836136926
oh yes	12.732174725569125
and from whose hands the count extricated me in so wonderful a manner	195.80563275011514
to be sure i remember it all now	29.809997289294014
he called himself vampa	72.09678227634188
you see its evident where the count got the name	198.32242274684737
but what could have been his motive for sending the cup to me	57.62736355601295
in the first place because i had spoken much of you to him as you may believe an	53.01144640733656
i trust and hope you never repeated to the count all the foolish remarks we used	178.8625888990615
i should not like to affirm upon oath that i have not	71.18174376294833
besides his presenting you the cup under the name of lord ruthven	159.54441838409235
oh but that is dreadful why the man must owe me a fearful grudge	101.00730997044391
does his action appear like that of an enemy	126.04793769347727
no certainly not	137.8173897727867
well then	6.846065492503168
and so he is in paris	26.74398849922388
and what effect does he produce	180.9750203460349
why said albert he was talked about for a week then the coronation of the queen 	53.38727603635643
my good fellow said chteaurenaud the count is your friend and you treat him acco	26.89191094208365
do not believe what albert is telling you countess so far from the sensation exc	70.36382456700771
his first astounding act upon coming amongst us was to present a pair of horses 	295.2750275890784

did you observe anyone during the first act asked chteaurenaud	55.1653724307519
in that box	569.0793558294487
no replied the countess it was certainly empty during the first act then resumin	64.24194249163263
i am sure of it	7.808370390142654
and who afterwards sent the cup to me	185.46647993894305
but i do nt know him said the countess i have a great mind to return it	17.635658021211935
do no such thing i beg of you he would only send you another formed of a magnifi	82.82219422134364
it is his way and you must take him as you find him	35.896373112860026
at this moment the bell rang to announce the drawing up of the curtain for the s	43.93286310336316
albert rose to return to his place	55.94605016445098
shall i see you again asked the countess	17.469432720428046
at the end of the next act with your permission i will come and inquire whether 	42.914504597332105

so now you are both forewarned	113.25073384754576
the young men bowed and quitted the box	43.18038507731516
upon reaching their stalls they found the whole of the audience in the parterre 	48.46293570508348

the second act passed away during one continued buzz of voicesone deep whisperin	171.50874333062697
upon this occasion an unmistakable sign from madame danglars intimated her desir	91.84019435723648
at the close of the act he therefore went to the baroness	54.41913204698299
having bowed to the two ladies he extended his hand to debray	43.34766236542744
by the baroness he was most graciously welcomed while eugnie received him with h	121.38222769045456
my dear fellow said debray you have come in the nick of time	18.033355380023572
there is madame overwhelming me with questions respecting the count she insists 	134.91641742904253
being no disciple of cagliostro i was wholly unable to do this so by way of gett	51.29212303434338
is it not almost incredible said madame danglars that a person having at least h	48.65148911580026
let me assure you madame said lucien that had i really the sum you mention at my	66.13985447294887
however i have turned the business over to morcerf so pray settle it with him as	110.13904386981721
30093 m	1.0215673448348233
i am very sure no nabob would have sent me a pair of horses worth 32000 francs w	45.96581764174623
he seems to have a mania for diamonds said morcerf smiling and i verily believe 	69.68906022060904
perhaps he has discovered some mine said madame danglars	60.07051161806017
i suppose you know he has an order for unlimited credit on the barons banking es	63.059079437904664
i was not aware of it replied albert but i can readily believe it	16.955388995860478
and further that he stated to m	149.6490184069078
danglars his intention of only staying a year in paris during which time he prop	99.31306088710633
he must be the shah of persia travelling incog	63.70220329148003
have you noticed the remarkable beauty of the young woman m	57.95316372565856
lucien inquired eugnie	68.33720879420025
i really never met with one woman so ready to do justice to the charms of anothe	86.37796469072941
a most lovely creature upon my soul was his verdict	131.47504759080428
who is this young person m	67.61604135105593
de morcerf inquired eugnie does anybody know	158.1513331874242
mademoiselle said albert replying to this direct appeal i can give you very exac	58.091610479783874
so i should suppose by her dress if you know no more than that everyone here is 	72.33448754410081
i am extremely sorry you find me so ignorant a cicerone replied morcerf but i am	42.68698576050714
then your count entertains visitors does he asked madame danglars	211.9701181256898
indeed he does and in a most lavish manner i can assure you	52.820627098915885
i must try and persuade m	246.06792236103345
danglars to invite him to a ball or dinner or something of the sort that he may 	112.37273177219647
what said debray laughing do you really mean you would go to his house	57.42854049443374
why not my husband could accompany me	136.36494372165174
but do you know this mysterious count is a bachelor	71.19729094256049
you have ample proof to the contrary if you look opposite said the baroness as s	93.96165128804053
no no exclaimed debray that girl is not his wife he told us himself she was his 	72.26474433440342
do you not recollect morcerf his telling us so at your breakfast	120.88715437594615
well then said the baroness if slave she be she has all the air and manner of a 	133.40634758208483
of the arabian nights	58.63436807504602
if you like but tell me my dear lucien what it is that constitutes a princess	34.19843327882312
why diamondsand she is covered with them	212.85738894604012
to me she seems overloaded observed eugnie she would look far better if she wore	382.96704176603964
see how the artist peeps out exclaimed madame danglars	125.55813985618897
my poor eugnie you must conceal your passion for the fine arts	86.02578390857269
i admire all that is beautiful returned the young lady	67.06972986314547
what do you think of the count inquired debray he is not much amiss according to	26.05002133269371
the count repeated eugnie as though it had not occurred to her to observe him so	47.901169029447345
i quite agree with you said morcerf and the secret of that very pallor is what w	89.27147898592716
the countess g insists upon it that he is a vampire	101.44050851727535
then the countess g has returned to paris has she inquired the baroness	64.50838747719963
is that she mamma asked eugnie almost opposite to us with that profusion of beau	66.46508226976702
yes said madame danglars that is she	18.93510991384508
shall i tell you what you ought to do morcerf	17.989588206688232
command me madame	75.98912577246702
well then you should go and bring your count of monte cristo to us	43.06866431904596
what for asked eugnie	150.37936215761766
what for why to converse with him of course	201.74200332307095
have you really no desire to meet him	29.92207568480911
none whatever replied eugnie	59.30013371084946
strange child murmured the baroness	85.7479109877645
he will very probably come of his own accord said morcerf	99.98932581247554
there do you see madame he recognizes you and bows	105.90933004507947
the baroness returned the salute in the most smiling and graceful manner	64.37413694468164
well said morcerf i may as well be magnanimous and tear myself away to forward y	57.3593279423402
adieu i will go and try if there are any means of speaking to him	41.79303393565489
go straight to his box that will be the simplest plan	45.07437244762489
but i have never been presented	43.07948854073285
presented to whom	41.05504004847101
to the beautiful greek	91.95285473426962
you say she is only a slave	44.43072549699604
while you assert that she is a queen or at least a princess	52.307810011083205
no i hope that when he sees me leave you he will come out	57.02359545227089
that is possiblego	101.2120699050642
i am going said albert as he made his parting bow	45.0420046659182
just as he was passing the counts box the door opened and monte cristo came fort	24.30657822669109
after giving some directions to ali who stood in the lobby the count took albert	43.30044732448238
carefully closing the box door ali placed himself before it while a crowd of spe	88.09451251405073
upon my word said monte cristo paris is a strange city and the parisians a very 	23.671167937157097
see that cluster of persons collected around poor ali who is as much astonished 	197.06621165362154
now i can promise you that a frenchman might show himself in public either in tu	83.5699873009996
that shows that the eastern nations have too much good sense to waste their time	171.5531565659583
however as far as ali is concerned i can assure you the interest he excites is m	75.58571534815586
really and what has procured me so flattering a distinction	149.2916557012049
what why yourself to be sure you give away horses worth a thousand louis you sav	222.68885921327572
and who has filled your head with all this nonsense	130.38374253724888
why in the first place i heard it from madame danglars who by the by is dying to	75.0632254773369
why if you sought concealment did you call your horse vampa	228.152687566767
that was an oversight certainly replied the count but tell me does the count of 	48.89529137013846
he will be here tonight	45.7227648928192
in what part of the house	31.23525403070566
in the baronesss box i believe	125.41985467546088
that charming young woman with her is her daughter	162.33739538299875
i congratulate you	86.40045638836897
morcerf smiled	95.78792661825683
we will discuss that subject at length some future time said he	112.56166507167143
but what do you think of the music	18.18770161560362
what music	13695.207789994844
why the music you have been listening to	73.74803946313865
oh it is well enough as the production of a human composer sung by featherless b	39.54716653616091
from which it would seem my dear count that you can at pleasure enjoy the seraph	61.49565853766958
30097 m	1.0144536499805283
you are right in some degree when i wish to listen to sounds more exquisitely at	106.22285201179668
then sleep here my dear count	83.07069892391253
the conditions are favorable what else was opera invented for	407.52907735760175
no thank you	22.634820063631132
your orchestra is too noisy	252.54356942563757
to sleep after the manner i speak of absolute calm and silence are necessary and	245.4583055743917
i knowthe famous hashish	4222.451802333076
so my dear viscount whenever you wish to be regaled with music come and sup with	79.1422081898113
i have already enjoyed that treat when breakfasting with you said morcerf	173.4419187453533
do you mean at rome	16.327755782657164
i do	21.18918430392272
ah then i suppose you heard haydes guzla the poor exile frequently beguiles a we	260.7985733308006
morcerf did not pursue the subject and monte cristo himself fell into a silent r	51.3047693740237
the bell rang at this moment for the rising of the curtain	44.123396105565206
you will excuse my leaving you said the count turning in the direction of his bo	24.137585253653373
what are you going	4.689980362134615
pray say everything that is kind to countess g on the part of her friend the vam	61.26181020697454
and what message shall i convey to the baroness	150.12079606336903
that with her permission i shall do myself the honor of paying my respects in th	94.02484674364884
the third act had begun and during its progress the count of morcerf according t	45.59561650235536
the count of morcerf was not a person to excite either interest or curiosity in 	58.14448658459192
the quick eye of monte cristo however marked his coming and a slight though mean	188.1543667846311
hayde whose soul seemed centred in the business of the stage like all unsophisti	106.63910499343997
30099 m	1.1199184618902
the third act passed off as usual	91.54781817258984
mesdemoiselles noblet julia and leroux executed the customary pirouettes robert 	55.49101115409345
after which the curtain again fell and the spectators poured forth from the thea	76.76917146597312
the count left his box and a moment later was saluting the baronne danglars who 	37.12803161372926
you are welcome count she exclaimed as he entered	54.892766613856224
i have been most anxious to see you that i might repeat orally the thanks writin	58.67953932421789
surely so trifling a circumstance can not deserve a place in your remembrance	147.46808988193447
believe me madame i had entirely forgotten it	104.65768140508915
but it is not so easy to forget monsieur that the very next day after your princ	44.938001028284546
30101 m	1.0449317681139128
this time at least i do not deserve your thanks	40.615285172778904
it was ali my nubian slave who rendered this service to madame de villefort	43.13772307102721
was it ali asked the count of morcerf who rescued my son from the hands of bandi	27.72527748187347
no count replied monte cristo taking the hand held out to him by the general in 	57.493011353754135
may i beg of you baroness to honor me with an introduction to your daughter	80.9287382388765
oh you are no strangerat least not by name replied madame danglars and the last 	61.02547552450667
eugnie continued the baroness turning towards her daughter this is the count of 	68.87876741176323
the count bowed while mademoiselle danglars bent her head slightly	89.72901858128785
you have a charming young person with you tonight count said eugnie	59.63618722258075
is she your daughter	121.07059971290184
no mademoiselle said monte cristo astonished at the coolness and freedom of the 	45.468615722000905
she is a poor unfortunate greek left under my care	206.3980951534221
and what is her name	21.615605221716375
hayde replied monte cristo	22.31995026739975
a greek murmured the count of morcerf	17.654041998044995
yes indeed count said madame danglars and tell me did you ever see at the court 	45.43511988645239
did i hear rightly monsieur said monte cristo that you served at yanina	34.14716965403473
i was inspectorgeneral of the pashas troops replied morcerf and it is no secret 	61.52117520117749
but look exclaimed madame danglars	155.05277531826476
where stammered morcerf	200.28116307137324
there said monte cristo placing his arms around the count and leaning with him o	31.01521977569896
it was as if the young girl beheld the head of medusa	20.096463067277284
she bent forwards as though to assure herself of the reality of what she saw the	76.32710911163454
the sound was heard by the people about ali who instantly opened the boxdoor	82.24258338416979
why count exclaimed eugnie what has happened to your ward she seems to have been	43.582547024596785
very probably answered the count	52.235278230370625
but do not be alarmed on her account	23.762647156258325
haydes nervous system is delicately organized and she is peculiarly susceptible 	315.55410539638694
however continued monte cristo drawing a small phial from his pocket i have an i	50.95617249519803
so saying he bowed to the baroness and her daughter exchanged a parting shake of	51.61889102232852
upon his return to hayde he found her still very pale	38.920503590988716
as soon as she saw him she seized his hand her own hands were moist and icy cold	43.905983517115175
who was it you were talking with over there she asked	183.6487733713923
with the count of morcerf answered monte cristo	17.29018332630566
he tells me he served your illustrious father and that he owes his fortune to hi	98.66569033515891
wretch exclaimed hayde her eyes flashing with rage he sold my father to the turk	31.638426363820905
something of this i heard in epirus said monte cristo but the particulars are st	41.97849002442463
you shall relate them to me my child	69.84125494438601
they are no doubt both curious and interesting	108.45176619267069
yes yes but let us go	12.724533411400705
i feel as though it would kill me to remain long near that dreadful man	135.9232382170411
so saying hayde arose and wrapping herself in her burnouse of white cashmere emb	78.57433686467067
do you observe said the countess g to albert who had returned to her side that m	36.53279443162474
chapter 54	1224.5295213655138
a flurry in stocks	53.98697578836434
some days after this meeting albert de morcerf visited the count of monte cristo	22.724352940981078
he came to renew the thanks of madame danglars which had been already conveyed t	61.493019486942565
albert was accompanied by lucien debray who joining in his friends conversation 	79.91707635641285
he was convinced that luciens visit was due to a double feeling of curiosity the	83.46262268115002
in short madame danglars not being able personally to examine in detail the dome	189.07308196845966
but the count did not appear to suspect that there could be the slightest connec	25.261967962081478
you are in constant communication with the baron danglars the count inquired of 	68.47603444044869
yes count you know what i told you	27.25666531678854
all remains the same then in that quarter	132.19105423162074
it is more than ever a settled thing said lucienand considering that this remark	69.11686971307796
ah said monte cristo i did not expect that the affair would be so promptly concl	18.13631996175136
oh things take their course without our assistance	327.6048407772036
while we are forgetting them they are falling into their appointed order and whe	179.81608626292794
my father and m	77.98510069774848
danglars served together in spain my father in the army and m	125.19751814486789
danglars in the commissariat department	110.20565732287177
it was there that my father ruined by the revolution and m	63.30805916901419
danglars who never had possessed any patrimony both laid the foundations of thei	92.99835512629976
yes said monte cristo i think m	15.521673374783534
danglars mentioned that in a visit which i paid him and continued he casting a s	124.9696166009102
very pretty or rather very beautiful replied albert but of that style of beauty 	177.30133156105583
you speak as if you were already her husband	68.98638250336066
ah returned albert in his turn looking around to see what lucien was doing	48.58147904664324
really said monte cristo lowering his voice you do not appear to me to be very e	25.441774744712426
mademoiselle danglars is too rich for me replied morcerf and that frightens me	30.27753785470511
bah exclaimed monte cristo that s a fine reason to give	25.770117980754197
are you not rich yourself	24.598133699545752
my fathers income is about 50000 francs per annum and he will give me perhaps te	30.753797104307925
that perhaps might not be considered a large sum in paris especially said the co	60.94684195365226
your name is celebrated your position magnificent and then the comte de morcerf 	54.97019420575582
as for me i consider the union with mademoiselle danglars a most suitable one sh	38.96782000489406
albert shook his head and looked thoughtful	20.74104825481522
there is still something else said he	47.65277922480108
i confess observed monte cristo that i have some difficulty in comprehending you	51.0941883182709
oh said morcerf this repugnance if repugnance it may be called is not all on my 	93.66810426536463
whence can it arise then for you told me your father desired the marriage	99.23443345074136
it is my mother who dissents she has a clear and penetrating judgment and does n	73.26336635541183
i can not account for it but she seems to entertain some prejudice against the d	78.44364780210061
30107 m	1.0629059076047551
ah said the count in a somewhat forced tone that may be easily explained the com	26.6288331361593
i do not know if that is her reason said albert but one thing i do know that if 	28.6103990831144
there was to have been a meeting six weeks ago in order to talk over and settle 	67.25628012395876
real interrupted the count smiling	54.16424930182368
oh real enough from anxiety doubtlessat any rate they postponed the matter for t	348.8724167742367
there is no hurry you know	43.69697597919916
i am not yet twentyone and eugnie is only seventeen but the two months expire ne	60.45225304025656
it must be done	17.257462645452186
my dear count you can not imagine how my mind is harassed	35.979991411026035
how happy you are in being exempt from all this	65.4334822283915
well and why should not you be free too what prevents you from being so	216.98204860292267
oh it will be too great a disappointment to my father if i do not marry mademois	40.3348666513063
marry her then said the count with a significant shrug of the shoulders	42.41263438374814
yes replied morcerf but that will plunge my mother into positive grief	127.84348126946965
then do not marry her said the count	41.78426632797049
well i shall see	20.674653701299793
i will try and think over what is the best thing to be done you will give me you	35.2557454552237
monte cristo turned away he seemed moved by this last remark	155.92097494190216
ah said he to debray who had thrown himself into an easychair at the farthest ex	18.71659748088552
oh no was the tranquil response i am too fond of art to attempt anything of that	85.485853522148
i am doing a little sum in arithmetic	94.14292533573604
in arithmetic	4041.0092878866794
yes i am calculatingby the way morcerf that indirectly concerns youi am calculat	147.24956215245862
that is not his biggest scoop said morcerf did he not make a million in spaniard	32.183354411691276

and what has caused the sudden fall from 409 to 206 asked monte cristo	92.52890974041497
i am profoundly ignorant of all these stockjobbing intrigues	77.82313731287209
because said albert laughing one piece of news follows another and there is ofte	112.54502749018779
ah said the count i see that m	16.263646215166432
danglars is accustomed to play at gaining or losing 300000 francs in a day he mu	74.773754914013
it is not he who plays exclaimed lucien it is madame danglars she is indeed dari	33.947956896307005

i would reform her it would be rendering a service to her future soninlaw	129.9558957452378
how would you set about it	93.43497852991692
ah that would be easy enoughi would give her a lesson	67.68672013911241

we can positively assert that his majesty did not quit the pontneuf	63.51675746420033
lucien half smiled	1707.1192506005575
monte cristo although apparently indifferent had not lost one word of this conve	127.98999233218993
this embarrassment had completely escaped albert but it caused lucien to shorten	204.23632175925394
the count in taking leave of him said something in a low voice to which he answe	39.027148775507314
the count returned to young morcerf	85.3462326789508
do you not think on reflection said he to him that you have done wrong in thus s	59.91040572307525
my dear count said morcerf i beg of you not to apply that title so prematurely	23.25049778474275
now speaking without any exaggeration is your mother really so very much averse 	244.31523523756874
so much so that the baroness very rarely comes to the house and my mother has no	63.39119007318304
then said the count i am emboldened to speak openly to you	31.01176668757654

de villefort has overwhelmed me with politeness in return for a service which a 	50.48424851096616

oh i am sure of it we talked of you an hour after you left us the other day	42.60392773084778
but to return to what we were saying	50.93079976581868
if my mother could know of this attention on your partand i will venture to tell	66.91202369501151
the count laughed	133.58279969630976
well said he to morcerf but i think your father will not be the only angry one m	34.182024137027966
and madame danglars will think me a very illmannered person	54.45172085116389

ah take care you were teaching me just now how in case of an invitation to dinne	149.0053995598122
i require the proof of a preengagement	46.53962667633104
i am not a banker like m	49.17109112094097
danglars but i am quite as incredulous as he is	33.479965912581434
i am going to give you a proof replied the count and he rang the bell	22.949442142450547
humph said morcerf this is the second time you have refused to dine with my moth	17.436813484393898
monte cristo started	43.63286795527579
oh you do not mean that said he besides here comes the confirmation of my assert	76.73407395997492
baptistin entered and remained standing at the door	32.179203527087225
i had no previous knowledge of your visit had i	144.74819015068414
indeed you are such an extraordinary person that i would not answer for it	39.65365685597564
at all events i could not guess that you would invite me to dinner	43.83051135405418
probably not	134.44080633218587
well listen baptistin what did i tell you this morning when i called you into my	41.25559104092299
to close the door against visitors as soon as the clock struck five replied the 	89.53873677359995
what then	109.67858252969896
ah my dear count said albert	4.521719300538391
no no i wish to do away with that mysterious reputation that you have given me m	46.23545417166929
i wish my life to be free and open	71.496776633743
go on baptistin	10.088961429016633
then to admit no one except major bartolomeo cavalcanti and his son	100.34798633630446
you hearmajor bartolomeo cavalcantia man who ranks amongst the most ancient nobi	172.63660746622244
the major will bring his son with him this evening the contino as we say in ital	87.29907329089963
if he proves himself worthy of it i will do what i can to advance his interests	66.81028862376202
you will assist me in the work will you not	28.503288168591865
most undoubtedly	254.8948522950791
this major cavalcanti is an old friend of yours then	53.27761806656361
by no means	20.270719311984987
he is a perfect nobleman very polite modest and agreeable such as may be found c	143.12589294265626
i have met him several times at florence bologna and lucca and he has now commun	30.44144075876529
the acquaintances one makes in travelling have a sort of claim on one they every	275.5454201832274

by the way i have received news of franz	26.888942566979058
have you is he still amusing himself in italy	171.5293535678235
i believe so however he regrets your absence extremely	472.0470878392706
he says you were the sun of rome and that without you all appears dark and cloud	155.99050667600676
his opinion of me is altered for the better then	178.2782968278729
no he still persists in looking upon you as the most incomprehensible and myster	103.91723259102253
he is a charming young man said monte cristo and i felt a lively interest in him	27.02553757711917
he is i think the son of general dpinay	60.792806392806426
he is	15.393709617517093
the same who was so shamefully assassinated in 1815	138.04870844688546
by the bonapartists	9.687652039227904
really i like him extremely is there not also a matrimonial engagement contempla	250.55818709614684
yes he is to marry mademoiselle de villefort	15.205762111365967
30115 m	1.1030836139355789
and you know i am to marry mademoiselle danglars said albert laughing	18.3431983280837
you smile	17647.272625670266
why do you do so	8.67683998928211
i smile because there appears to me to be about as much inclination for the cons	78.6792774701167
but really my dear count we are talking as much of women as they do of us it is 	61.16662420134367
albert rose	314.4436545050158
are you going	3.861263063694031
really that is a good ideatwo hours have i been boring you to death with my comp	83.50601386350986
indeed count you are the most polished man in the world	29.602889673419853
and your servants too how very well behaved they are there is quite a style abou	94.94877864196704
monsieur baptistin especially i could never get such a man as that	65.59458438002423
my servants seem to imitate those you sometimes see in a play who because they h	265.872880824394
therefore if you part with m	352.0557551652301
baptistin give me the refusal of him	63.492169058818114
by all means	37.60750768459676
that is not all give my compliments to your illustrious luccanese cavalcante of 	73.41906082117875
ah ha you will do as much as that will you	27.675171065109687
well really nothing is certain in this world	140.43055774863075
oh count what a service you might render me i should like you a hundred times be	68.04252162485166
nothing is impossible gravely replied monte cristo and taking leave of albert he	66.18500066653843
bertuccio appeared	276.11887777541676
monsieur bertuccio you understand that i intend entertaining company on saturday	118.81258782835978
bertuccio slightly started	2725.207301052511
i shall require your services to see that all be properly arranged	103.05363848964949
it is a beautiful house or at all events may be made so	50.635132943556485
there must be a good deal done before it can deserve that title your excellency 	81.5174344840952
let them all be taken away and changed then with the exception of the sleepingch	66.93927708658443
bertuccio bowed	54.63174477493203
you will not touch the garden either as to the yard you may do what you please w	51.24239959925425
i will do everything in my power to carry out your wishes your excellency	53.730901614371426
i should be glad however to receive your excellencys commands concerning the din	83.6738591624619
really my dear m	14.1857155052499
bertuccio said the count since you have been in paris you have become quite nerv	24.888153987441946
but surely your excellency will be so good as to inform me whom you are expectin	24.068143741277908
i do not yet know myself neither is it necessary that you should do so	57.70220959818195
lucullus dines with lucullus that is quite sufficient	164.96241482223462
bertuccio bowed and left the room	14.434029318028987
chapter 55	1144.1077252637272
major cavalcanti	7.972442561504601
both the count and baptistin had told the truth when they announced to morcerf t	42.24737384541924
seven oclock had just struck and m	79.26068071107534
bertuccio according to the command which had been given him had two hours before	50.453661295676724
the visitor was about fiftytwo years of age dressed in one of the green surtouts	33.79320067391198
he wore trousers of blue cloth boots tolerably clean but not of the brightest po	154.34837561672356
such was the picturesque costume of the person who rang at the gate and demanded	43.90019509349336
30 in the avenue des champslyses that the count of monte cristo lived and who be	31.19041023919893
the small and angular head of this man his white hair and thick gray moustaches 	106.20431536231644
therefore scarcely had the stranger time to pronounce his name before the count 	86.28546431692162
he was ushered into a simple and elegant drawingroom and the count rose to meet 	83.73033502252954
ah my dear sir you are most welcome i was expecting you	42.52439719510858
indeed said the italian was your excellency then aware of my visit	87.900403514935
yes i had been told that i should see you today at seven oclock	30.54184351666361
then you have received full information concerning my arrival	172.99234698092246
of course	9.68390871261306
ah so much the better i feared this little precaution might have been forgotten	62.880962679622364
30119 m	2.1936004097797204
what precaution	7097.131346918603
that of informing you beforehand of my coming	261.83416708385056
oh no it has not	21.15555529230575
but you are sure you are not mistaken	30.67928892478657
very sure	142.43627826301721
it really was i whom your excellency expected at seven oclock this evening	126.2219997269012
i will prove it to you beyond a doubt	83.40732167908405
oh no never mind that said the italian it is not worth the trouble	29.0214392005782
yes yes said monte cristo	6.552852529130227
his visitor appeared slightly uneasy	1584.4851585943716
let me see said the count are you not the marquis bartolomeo cavalcanti	18.04747181851056
bartolomeo cavalcanti joyfully replied the italian yes i am really he	75.85116172017358
exmajor in the austrian service	40.94021793901329
was i a major timidly asked the old soldier	155.732614309827
yes said monte cristo you were a major that is the title the french give to the 	51.81124853227614
very good said the major i do not demand more you understand	39.61000264423209
your visit here today is not of your own suggestion is it said monte cristo	63.31147046367596
no certainly not	148.14391561658996
you were sent by some other person	91.08395763123656
by the excellent abb busoni	39.3306543160834
exactly so said the delighted major	101.36343506944849
and you have a letter	18.875310906098424
yes there it is	32.21279424400786
give it to me then	13.412410552852737
and monte cristo took the letter which he opened and read	30.809073428609306
the major looked at the count with his large staring eyes and then took a survey	47.517850576107335
yes yes i see	18.03032019767893
major cavalcanti a worthy patrician of lucca a descendant of the cavalcanti of f	30.71909836416771
monte cristo raised his eyes from the paper and bowed	37.02098834648742
half a million said he magnificent	266.6807947089889
half a million is it said the major	55.24170940735384
yes in so many words and it must be so for the abb knows correctly the amount of	108.76990999022827
be it half a million then but on my word of honor i had no idea that it was so m	48.19575002943524
because you are robbed by your steward	78.17184989159338
you must make some reformation in that quarter	69.69391201817513
you have opened my eyes said the italian gravely i will show the gentlemen the d	72.54636978852065
monte cristo resumed the perusal of the letter	28.12869763240685
and who only needs one thing more to make him happy	177.98109583201173
yes indeed but one said the major with a sigh	26.66137795378258
which is to recover a lost and adored son	134.39875912876323
a lost and adored son	627.3071485246172
stolen away in his infancy either by an enemy of his noble family or by the gyps	64.15555445640373
at the age of five years said the major with a deep sigh and raising his eye to 	25.507242000930475
unhappy father said monte cristo	21.90206124843397
the count continued	60.693255311002055
i have given him renewed life and hope in the assurance that you have the power 	74.53496391746376
the major looked at the count with an indescribable expression of anxiety	31.797867358135044
i have the power of so doing said monte cristo	40.445985165988205
the major recovered his selfpossession	274.6603543513692
so then said he the letter was true to the end	38.63697091490441
did you doubt it my dear monsieur bartolomeo	16.48834536014549
no indeed certainly not a good man a man holding religious office as does the ab	137.87746770126844
ah true said monte cristo there is a postscript	17.122429174963855
yes yes repeated the major yesthereisapostscript	84.71526152642878
in order to save major cavalcanti the trouble of drawing on his banker i send hi	155.95495609823257
the major awaited the conclusion of the postscript apparently with great anxiety	168.05045139866561
very good said the count	7.538677064340923
he said very good muttered the major thensir replied he	134.5227592440799
then what asked monte cristo	20.22164255913608
then the postscript	83.61598601934318
well what of the postscript	70.30640683505838
then the postscript is as favorably received by you as the rest of the letter	64.16415131473059
certainly the abb busoni and myself have a small account open between us	137.39220439011277
i do not remember if it is exactly 48000 francs which i am still owing him but i	33.10937310566255
you attached great importance then to this postscript my dear monsieur cavalcant	183.29314382561228
i must explain to you said the major that fully confiding in the signature of th	41.09978708731994
is it possible that a man of your standing should be embarrassed anywhere said m	79.83929885330289
why really i know no one said the major	29.689482148686544
but then you yourself are known to others	190.5251092118483
yes i am known so that	72.67991700643303
proceed my dear monsieur cavalcanti	11.622762943301101
so that you will remit to me these 48000 francs	56.14174845318799
certainly at your first request	82.15580426743075
the majors eyes dilated with pleasing astonishment	430.69230460242557
but sit down said monte cristo really i do not know what i have been thinking of	22.175769204988892
do nt mention it	27.399583197648518
the major drew an armchair towards him and proceeded to seat himself	76.71779328964921
now said the count what will you takea glass of sherry port or alicante	44.12505827118194
alicante if you please it is my favorite wine	61.485132332650906
i have some that is very good	68.02493859724329
you will take a biscuit with it will you not	26.097434268698848
yes i will take a biscuit as you are so obliging	41.80597948246815
monte cristo rang baptistin appeared	149.6468776758396
the count advanced to meet him	33.98833669709962
well said he in a low voice	6.5016028292481405
the young man is here said the valet de chambre in the same tone	13.823815164366632
into what room did you take him	56.15727747412273
into the blue drawingroom according to your excellencys orders	122.20597386625988
that s right now bring the alicante and some biscuits	140.43799078373738
baptistin left the room	19.801502680172852
really said the major i am quite ashamed of the trouble i am giving you	30.190727406744728
pray do nt mention such a thing said the count	22.526995366041657
baptistin reentered with glasses wine and biscuits	423.95277057249706
the count filled one glass but in the other he only poured a few drops of the ru	53.11094472239264
the bottle was covered with spiders webs and all the other signs which indicate 	75.58535492823809
the major made a wise choice he took the full glass and a biscuit	147.93454391520825
the count told baptistin to leave the plate within reach of his guest who began 	102.88817033417233
30123 m	1.079778908678347
so sir you lived at lucca did you you were rich noble held in great esteemhad al	123.40635587491202
all said the major hastily swallowing his biscuit positively all	197.7629010758823
and yet there was one thing wanting in order to complete your happiness	91.75435678119305
only one thing said the italian	14.54664374044898
and that one thing your lost child	283.0486852570867
ah said the major taking a second biscuit that consummation of my happiness was 	58.543711129066196
the worthy major raised his eyes to heaven and sighed	106.17332687981022
let me hear then said the count who this deeply regretted son was for i always u	88.83418867980254
that was the general opinion sir said the major and i	29.481046863590176
yes replied the count and you confirmed the report	33.60363119418052
a youthful indiscretion i suppose which you were anxious to conceal from the wor	93.87289090373991
the major recovered himself and resumed his usual calm manner at the same time c	60.144372195788115
yes said the major i did wish this fault to be hidden from every eye	128.254832677784
not on your own account surely replied monte cristo for a man is above that sort	72.0232156276887
oh no certainly not on my own account said the major with a smile and a shake of	26.472636187086998
but for the sake of the mother said the count	14.080634654053446
yes for the mothers sakehis poor mother cried the major taking a third biscuit	108.8063775731037
take some more wine my dear cavalcanti said the count pouring out for him a seco	28.373731011691536
his poor mother murmured the major trying to get the lachrymal gland in operatio	45.858259514166484
she belonged to one of the first families in italy i think did she not	65.32720402793399
she was of a noble family of fiesole count	95.8003510899841
and her name was	44.76275100413452
do you desire to know her name	32.79808190491613
oh said monte cristo it would be quite superfluous for you to tell me for i alre	13.96402506950727
the count knows everything said the italian bowing	95.0806659883539
oliva corsinari was it not	24.720834001226727
oliva corsinari	14.83413412964293
a marchioness	474.0324899988815
a marchioness	340.26291213744514
and you married her at last notwithstanding the opposition of her family	164.43199834702446
yes that was the way it ended	92.11092567382025
and you have doubtless brought all your papers with you said monte cristo	32.906987034579736
what papers	18082.778523099456
the certificate of your marriage with oliva corsinari and the register of your c	46.65156348163272
the register of my childs birth	180.97269037944466
the register of the birth of andrea cavalcantiof your son is not his name andrea	24.855456520968392
i believe so said the major	30.023700181020683
what you believe so	193.31552748109866
i dare not positively assert it as he has been lost for so long a time	72.0573610044881
well then said monte cristo you have all the documents with you	18.605276527488634
your excellency i regret to say that not knowing it was necessary to come provid	43.367272082301
that is unfortunate returned monte cristo	27.334146320421254
were they then so necessary	289.38031027449034
they were indispensable	220.6086766466819
the major passed his hand across his brow	54.2166657859685
ah perbacco indispensable were they	774.6467890047387
certainly they were supposing there were to be doubts raised as to the validity 	94.55773009015167
true said the major there might be doubts raised	107.57859563086309
in that case your son would be very unpleasantly situated	79.71422163717615
it would be fatal to his interests	63.87198562058155
it might cause him to fail in some desirable matrimonial alliance	310.8054685574657
o peccato	8062.061284420609
you must know that in france they are very particular on these points it is not 	45.87979255292605
marriage is a civil affair in france and in order to marry in an orthodox manner	44.756508160682245
that is the misfortune you see i have not these necessary papers	124.34323061271715
fortunately i have them though said monte cristo	31.757931939289936
you have them	71.60575046663821
i have them	52.41818376655909
ah indeed said the major who seeing the object of his journey frustrated by the 	32.18696864925367
i do not at all wonder at itone can not think of everything but happily the abb 	94.69516987323513
he is an excellent person	27.75230662285797
he is extremely prudent and thoughtful	237.05953445328132
he is an admirable man said the major and he sent them to you	24.915393149348144
here they are	20.67015873994293
the major clasped his hands in token of admiration	44.76803409026399
you married oliva corsinari in the church of san paolo del montecattini here is 	30.209793809044964
yes indeed there it is truly said the italian looking on with astonishment	53.088549242470464
and here is andrea cavalcantis baptismal register given by the cur of saravezza	79.1587768820646
all quite correct	1048.199506963892
take these documents then they do not concern me	83.99037504433412
you will give them to your son who will of course take great care of them	83.18136703466371
i should think so indeed if he were to lose them	72.418765508696
well and if he were to lose them said monte cristo	36.83693839389045
in that case replied the major it would be necessary to write to the cur for dup	20.082486711399724
it would be a difficult matter to arrange said monte cristo	21.69570045551972
almost an impossibility replied the major	91.41869525021177
i am very glad to see that you understand the value of these papers	30.96574500562631
i regard them as invaluable	503.3361129043565
now said monte cristo as to the mother of the young man	13.234494150772498
as to the mother of the young man repeated the italian with anxiety	31.415656854372244
as regards the marchesa corsinari	22.38336058996305
really said the major difficulties seem to thicken upon us will she be wanted in	109.61835082954626
no sir replied monte cristo besides has she not	39.644184910562025
yes sir said the major she has	30.344572870513275
30127 m	1.0364449015372095
paid the last debt of nature	115.49734595628334
alas yes returned the italian	22.652495304026818
i knew that said monte cristo she has been dead these ten years	77.7247494781748
and i am still mourning her loss exclaimed the major drawing from his pocket a c	84.21860760277316
what would you have said monte cristo we are all mortal	18.87357839906361
now you understand my dear monsieur cavalcanti that it is useless for you to tel	17.757579840536515
stories of gypsies who steal children are not at all in vogue in this part of th	83.90835321977256
you sent him for his education to a college in one of the provinces and now you 	66.48314974694155
that is the reason which has induced you to leave via reggio where you have live	41.86125489233878
that will be sufficient	54.78767038302004
you think so	84.56726108291159
very well then	5.386422962143094
if they should hear of the separation	88.50393448775219
ah yes what could i say	40.641332287731395
that an unfaithful tutor bought over by the enemies of your family	148.26914352318565
by the corsinari	9.598434550759567
had stolen away this child in order that your name might become extinct	112.61272022569655
that is reasonable since he is an only son	85.80304544661907
well now that all is arranged do not let these newly awakened remembrances be fo	266.2880224360299
you have doubtless already guessed that i was preparing a surprise for you	64.52124643706463
an agreeable one asked the italian	91.20069130149564
ah i see the eye of a father is no more to be deceived than his heart	37.172371243444914
hum said the major	15.581004368143278
someone has told you the secret or perhaps you guessed that he was here	74.4521992789114
that who was here	116.5668921847266
your childyour sonyour andrea	492.1276323249199
i did guess it replied the major with the greatest possible coolness	92.71657085839965
then he is here	27.404365455957958
he is said monte cristo when the valet de chambre came in just now he told me of	36.82161592615391
ah very well very well said the major clutching the buttons of his coat at each 	47.322474497127374
my dear sir said monte cristo i understand your emotion you must have time to re	26.73581537824396
i will in the meantime go and prepare the young man for this muchdesired intervi	55.15437807851606
i should quite imagine that to be the case said cavalcanti	53.99565187513447
well in a quarter of an hour he shall be with you	15.601836025978823
you will bring him then you carry your goodness so far as even to present him to	68.47720991957391
no i do not wish to come between a father and son	53.795184419959575
your interview will be private	123.60971411909098
but do not be uneasy even if the powerful voice of nature should be silent you c	107.2092225464984
he is a fine young man of fair complexiona little too fair perhapspleasing in ma	132.8745234961167
by the way said the major you know i have only the 2000 francs which the abb bus	34.98200858887604
and you want money that is a matter of course my dear m	50.54592447097879
well here are 8000 francs on account	72.63719811963105
the majors eyes sparkled brilliantly	742.1033262982143
it is 40000 francs which i now owe you said monte cristo	28.442321161671142
does your excellency wish for a receipt said the major at the same time slipping	20.373261639359377
for what said the count	15.751255860358508
i thought you might want it to show the abb busoni	63.96058416299963
well when you receive the remaining 40000 you shall give me a receipt in full	91.3451854020858
between honest men such excessive precaution is i think quite unnecessary	876.9309216798023
yes so it is between perfectly upright people	798.4904800954519
one word more said monte cristo	17.29576994643107
say on	277.24095164005473
you will permit me to make one remark	45.5984538804236
certainly pray do so	84.2610257224498
then i should advise you to leave off wearing that style of dress	136.820936556603
indeed said the major regarding himself with an air of complete satisfaction	40.677878685504275
it may be worn at via reggio but that costume however elegant in itself has long	212.44651484582252
that s unfortunate	169.60584920473028
oh if you really are attached to your old mode of dress you can easily resume it	77.85424083830917
but what shall i wear	56.51239913252807
what you find in your trunks	77.09323440552696
in my trunks i have but one portmanteau	71.90033704833341
i dare say you have nothing else with you	71.26671757695847
what is the use of boring ones self with so many things besides an old soldier a	61.68799774565333
that is just the caseprecisely so	134.78646273843475
but you are a man of foresight and prudence therefore you sent your luggage on b	67.21357605615383
it has arrived at the htel des princes rue de richelieu	19.974558537162117
it is there you are to take up your quarters	63.90906198189634
then in these trunks	158.28139767423377
i presume you have given orders to your valet de chambre to put in all you are l	56.6103022180884
on grand occasions you must wear your uniform that will look very well	271.07202683927426
do not forget your crosses	86.99493307173864
they still laugh at them in france and yet always wear them for all that	107.5870600466919
very well very well said the major who was in ecstasy at the attention paid him 	37.42810826029132
now said monte cristo that you have fortified yourself against all painful excit	52.0919196596558
cavalcanti to meet your lost andrea	230.98632134341148
saying which monte cristo bowed and disappeared behind the tapestry leaving the 	106.58847092837786
chapter 56	1084.0730488120741
andrea cavalcanti	14.25986244342117
the count of monte cristo entered the adjoining room which baptistin had designa	16.10028870761265
baptistin had not found any difficulty in recognizing the person who presented h	46.431522902224756
he was certainly the tall young man with light hair red beard black eyes and bri	54.254876344113086
when the count entered the room the young man was carelessly stretched on a sofa	31.584207175824258
on perceiving the count he rose quickly	32.425835832459796
the count of monte cristo i believe said he	16.60399795460304
yes sir and i think i have the honor of addressing count andrea cavalcanti	24.64667046619384
count andrea cavalcanti repeated the young man accompanying his words with a bow	36.35945793653049
you are charged with a letter of introduction addressed to me are you not said t	46.02267573756274
i did not mention that because the signature seemed to me so strange	46.127012161633516
the letter signed sinbad the sailor is it not	102.32697784976658
exactly so	79.69290048473296
now as i have never known any sinbad with the exception of the one celebrated in	45.42414781126061
well it is one of his descendants and a great friend of mine he is a very rich e	46.775767757738585
ah indeed then that explains everything that is extraordinary said andrea	65.02806803511035
he is then the same englishman whom i metatahyes indeed	94.42764874589636
well monsieur i am at your service	19.016300377155556
if what you say be true replied the count smiling perhaps you will be kind enoug	61.55295384163636
certainly i will do so said the young man with a quickness which gave proof of h	19.35845975194615
i am as you have said the count andrea cavalcanti son of major bartolomeo cavalc	29.16991040737064
our family although still rich for my fathers income amounts to half a million h	152.1850011068852
since i have arrived at years of discretion and become my own master i have been	81.15844155836375
at length i received this letter from your friend which states that my father is	88.6637708790159
really all you have related to me is exceedingly interesting said monte cristo o	43.39127685006861
the count from the moment of first entering the drawingroom had not once lost si	150.58321828255936
most undoubtedly replied monte cristo your father major bartolomeo cavalcanti	67.95027760666004
the expression of terror which for the moment had overspread the features of the	57.259774527686105
ah yes that is the name certainly	66.10684249078328
major bartolomeo cavalcanti	8.451964818382606
and you really mean to say monsieur that my dear father is here	54.879209684402994
yes sir and i can even add that i have only just left his company	78.93518489731782
the history which he related to me of his lost son touched me to the quick indee	114.32133314087653
at length he one day received a letter stating that the abductors of his son now	108.58029945779577
your father did not hesitate an instant and the sum was sent to the frontier of 	41.78890894562975
you were in the south of france i think	15.224730815936205
yes replied andrea with an embarrassed air i was in the south of france	14.87230205846408
a carriage was to await you at nice	100.99883345533627
precisely so and it conveyed me from nice to genoa from genoa to turin from turi	90.5189270569575
30133 m	1.2183247865376838
indeed then your father ought to have met with you on the road for it is exactly	41.507066719782756
but said andrea if my father had met me i doubt if he would have recognized me i	46.83827302255638
oh the voice of nature said monte cristo	36.84843662519618
true interrupted the young man i had not looked upon it in that light	45.85295709211929
now replied monte cristo there is only one source of uneasiness left in your fat	81.42959554842989
finally he is anxious to see if you have been fortunate enough to escape the bad	54.03290795041955
sir exclaimed the young man quite astounded i hope no false report	67.07599849859481
as for myself i first heard you spoken of by my friend wilmore the philanthropis	86.19511802710738
i believe he found you in some unpleasant position but do not know of what natur	55.84804420691995
your misfortunes engaged his sympathies so you see you must have been interestin	103.85600486073481
he told me that he was anxious to restore you to the position which you had lost	43.11328294510726
he did seek and has found him apparently since he is here now and finally my fri	193.28464963841972
i am quite aware that my friend wilmore is peculiar but he is sincere and as ric	33.492276798618484

those who took me from my father and who always intended sooner or later to sell	136.07148208993507
i have therefore received a very good education and have been treated by these k	85.16033146414482
monte cristo smiled with satisfaction it appeared as if he had not expected so m	41.32806799320367
andrea cavalcanti	17.218595655216966
besides continued the young man if there did appear some defect in education or 	101.71242487980174
well said monte cristo in an indifferent tone you will do as you please count fo	27.342365452943227
your history is quite a romance and the world which delights in romances in yell	87.26561124221513
this is the kind of difficulty which i wished to represent to you my dear count	31.610370605572662
you would hardly have recited your touching history before it would go forth to 	215.7610906748917
you would be no longer a lost child found but you would be looked upon as an ups	91.0483067611145
you might excite a little curiosity but it is not everyone who likes to be made 	92.23953088421635
i agree with you monsieur said the young man turning pale and in spite of himsel	20.951936635189526
nevertheless you must not exaggerate the evil said monte cristo for by endeavori	45.745804839823215
you must resolve upon one simple and single line of conduct and for a man of you	209.29669969382968
andrea visibly changed countenance	5944.007313715495
i would offer myself as your surety and friendly adviser said monte cristo did i	57.409593849592305
however your excellency said andrea in consideration of lord wilmore by whom i w	42.26678812574487
yes certainly interrupted monte cristo but lord wilmore did not omit to inform m	81.25323290728525
andrea that the season of your youth was rather a stormy one	133.7901676143884
ah said the count watching andreas countenance i do not demand any confession fr	60.73424932098001
you shall soon see him	27.587618772469053
he is a little stiff and pompous in his manner and he is disfigured by his unifo	40.978420426249954
we are not generally very severe with the austrians	53.094245331441655
in short you will find your father a very presentable person i assure you	41.3866089281106
ah sir you have given me confidence it is so long since we were separated that i	43.524822334709604
he is a millionairehis income is 500000 francs	58.32228393841958
then said the young man with anxiety i shall be sure to be placed in an agreeabl	16.74920495767531
one of the most agreeable possible my dear sir he will allow you an income of 50	59.7697903230647
then in that case i shall always choose to remain there	59.06885990039591
you can not control circumstances my dear sir man proposes and god disposes	210.9504049713863
andrea sighed	386.7488797225365
but said he so long as i do remain in paris and nothing forces me to quit it do 	83.27991098976348
you may	35.97101962963412
shall i receive it from my father asked andrea with some uneasiness	27.40854734932183
yes you will receive it from your father personally but lord wilmore will be the	59.740556006027134
he has at the request of your father opened an account of 5000 francs a month at	52.80584449412131
danglars which is one of the safest banks in paris	50.4613123771354
and does my father mean to remain long in paris asked andrea	78.18519556757167
only a few days replied monte cristo	21.74632215327917
his service does not allow him to absent himself more than two or three weeks to	54.33532926364009
ah my dear father exclaimed andrea evidently charmed with the idea of his speedy	28.991584163871842
therefore said monte cristo feigning to mistake his meaningtherefore i will not 	60.73749296644132
are you prepared to embrace your worthy father	95.3220794045973

go then into the drawingroom my young friend where you will find your father awa	37.50381185818729
andrea made a low bow to the count and entered the adjoining room	27.3716706893877
monte cristo watched him till he disappeared and then touched a spring in a pane	56.66558569876981
the young man closed the door behind him and advanced towards the major who had 	52.935528310314076
ah my dear father said andrea in a loud voice in order that the count might hear	17.656790722710646
how do you do my dear son said the major gravely	25.006374052498426
after so many years of painful separation said andrea in the same tone of voice 	55.09145262293674
indeed it is after so long a separation	101.73973419378339
will you not embrace me sir said andrea	12.763342757445304
30139 m	1.0960081840270262
if you wish it my son said the major and the two men embraced each other after t	27.06051558509133
then we are once more reunited said andrea	50.908534649086434
once more replied the major	49.73523940158897
never more to be separated	98.94521817534847
why as to thati think my dear son you must be by this time so accustomed to fran	66.23718903157781
the fact is said the young man that i should be exceedingly grieved to leave it	34.94596345190879
as for me you must know i can not possibly live out of lucca therefore i shall r	38.430096062018784
but before you leave france my dear father i hope you will put me in possession 	47.44291083520623
certainly i am come expressly on that account it has cost me much trouble to fin	62.52176500341723
where are these papers then	65.71527171043499
here they are	18.9538542858077
andrea seized the certificate of his fathers marriage and his own baptismal regi	37.75671568028281
when he had perused the documents an indefinable expression of pleasure lighted 	170.22104132266597
then there is no longer any such thing in italy as being condemned to the galley	47.489796584887564
the major drew himself up to his full height	143.05063547358233
whywhat do you mean by that question	51.48388885189446
i mean that if there were it would be impossible to draw up with impunity two su	37.414422027702784
in france my dear sir half such a piece of effrontery as that would cause you to	77.0659993765343
will you be good enough to explain your meaning said the major endeavoring as mu	31.078841567357653
my dear m	9.49758539788275
cavalcanti said andrea taking the major by the arm in a confidential manner how 	85.8170801238717
the major was about to speak when andrea continued in a low voice	40.496092663736995
nonsense i am going to set you an example of confidence they give me 50000 franc	61.879315659673416
the major looked anxiously around him	160.44419478491997
make yourself easy we are quite alone said andrea besides we are conversing in i	73.55007599246416
well then replied the major they paid me 50000 francs down	60.72107379250143
monsieur cavalcanti said andrea do you believe in fairy tales	29.311865255818148
i used not to do so but i really feel now almost obliged to have faith in them	89.81167664755877
you have then been induced to alter your opinion you have had some proofs of the	52.075801407275215
most palpable proofs said he as you may perceive	148.7299044156948
you think then that i may rely on the counts promises	68.17518944620741
certainly i do	17.909753612244316
you are sure he will keep his word with me	35.92280250199289
to the letter but at the same time remember we must continue to play our respect	64.37367650662046
i as a tender father	321.64423776000257
and i as a dutiful son as they choose that i shall be descended from you	86.26983096940332
whom do you mean by they	50.62908505418598
ma foi i can hardly tell but i was alluding to those who wrote the letter you re	48.41401570175534
from whom	56.67301675661172
from a certain abb busoni	40.58043007493106
have you any knowledge of him	16.282890266400674
no i have never seen him	12.996419554007087
what did he say in the letter	25.4254933056404
you will promise not to betray me	74.41762877331226
rest assured of that you well know that our interests are the same	70.6236944465209
then read for yourself and the major gave a letter into the young mans hand	72.78840337790348
andrea read in a low voice	25.0789949111438

what do you mean said the major	8.705213259763202
i was going to say that i received a letter almost to the same effect	34.72851712715469
from the abb busoni	11.500252414581984
from whom then	73.11835639450554
from an englishman called lord wilmore who takes the name of sinbad the sailor	40.26727070411686
and of whom you have no more knowledge than i of the abb busoni	31.932673159573355
you are mistaken there i am ahead of you	47.27458172833146

there is a dupe somewhere	58.44051366901662

no i agree with you there	108.86761665029195
we must play the game to the end and consent to be blindfolded	53.94329473324592
ah you shall see i promise you i will sustain my part to admiration	76.55181812358552
i never once doubted your doing so	368.94317094517174
monte cristo chose this moment for reentering the drawingroom	87.13492429615712
on hearing the sound of his footsteps the two men threw themselves in each other	29.18797026347373
well marquis said monte cristo you appear to be in no way disappointed in the so	69.05404834329237

we were having a confidential conversation returned valentine she was owning to 	166.55251564110011

dear valentine	3.9217086469704077
that will account to you for the unreserved manner which you observed between me	138.21310983911738

come what did she say	116.70431977654393
she told me that she loved no one said valentine that she disliked the idea of b	40.70667361085258
ah you see	29.0349071857363
well what does that prove asked valentine	52.9176854878943
nothing replied maximilian	8.352777498627221
then why did you smile	69.90619247762676
why you know very well that you are reflecting on yourself valentine	52.268752475549704
do you want me to go away	11.238698229196565
ah no no	29.522686912328265
but do not let us lose time you are the subject on which i wish to speak	39.32928527473838
true we must be quick for we have scarcely ten minutes more to pass together	59.755256857259276
ma foi said maximilian in consternation	10.980113128119628
yes you are right i am but a poor friend to you	28.85742002618969
what a life i cause you to lead poor maximilian you who are formed for happiness	195.52890077433074
well what does it signify valentine so long as i am satisfied and feel that even	37.43963034473918
those are kind and cheering words	181.2547478016044
you must hope for us both maximilian that will make me at least partly happy	100.06573615223223
but why must you leave me so soon	77.77513312539328
i do not know particulars	54.47128869527111
i can only tell you that madame de villefort sent to request my presence as she 	33.62888564051803
let them take my fortune i am already too rich and perhaps when they have taken 	72.89729500315808
you would love me as much if i were poor would you not maximilian	71.75949626870894
oh i shall always love you	58.99693900984933
what should i care for either riches or poverty if my valentine was near me and 	143.4536520841249
i do not think that is the case	10.122514642756862
however it may be valentine you must not be alarmed	26.72719232078442
i assure you that as long as i live i shall never love anyone else	51.85545321673409
do you think to reassure me when you say that maximilian	29.581194649508678
pardon me you are right	10.856983791537337
i am a brute	48.23332797324114
but i was going to tell you that i met m	16.1151701866776
de morcerf the other day	19.536384425421865
monsieur franz is his friend you know	16.04851637156105
what then	114.15992618068655
monsieur de morcerf has received a letter from franz announcing his immediate re	46.43337165202788
valentine turned pale and leaned her hand against the gate	38.84020861835879
ah heavens if it were that but no the communication would not come through madam	135.85390572761918
why not	68.26689242502816
becausei scarcely know whybut it has appeared as if madame de villefort secretly	186.93314463271267
is it so then i feel as if i could adore madame de villefort	29.82376011529393
do not be in such a hurry to do that said valentine with a sad smile	14.707665159471775
if she objects to your marrying m	388.37404112660414
dpinay she would be all the more likely to listen to any other proposition	100.32277273960844
no maximilian it is not suitors to which madame de villefort objects it is marri	37.948781029416885
marriage if she dislikes that so much why did she ever marry herself	138.74076251193574
you do not understand me maximilian	14.572782668620007
about a year ago i talked of retiring to a convent	132.53307504326062
madame de villefort in spite of all the remarks which she considered it her duty	54.83586569444783
you can form no idea of the expression of that old mans eye when he looks at me 	103.41954271339138
when he learned my resolution i shall never forget the reproachful look which he	103.86615744939783
ah maximilian i experienced at that moment such remorse for my intention that th	88.84096644908365
when i had ceased speaking he thankfully raised his eyes to heaven but without u	63.36411221971157
ah maximilian i may have much to suffer but i feel as if my grandfathers look at	53.97509670276311
dear valentine you are a perfect angel and i am sure i do not know what isabring	14.612319537977724
but tell me what interest madame de villefort can have in your remaining unmarri	48.87952125424633
did i not tell you just now that i was rich maximiliantoo rich i possess nearly 	84.23575705437707
noirtier evidently intends making me his heir	335.8386513462394
my brother edward who inherits nothing from his mother will therefore be poor in	101.4790188259764
now if i had taken the veil all this fortune would have descended to my father a	73.22470385265692
ah how strange it seems that such a young and beautiful woman should be so avari	57.47574262109683
it is not for herself that she is so but for her son and what you regard as a vi	54.10126678328246
but could you not compromise matters and give up a portion of your fortune to he	92.58465162773201
how could i make such a proposition especially to a woman who always professes t	81.79314198964742
valentine i have always regarded our love in the light of something sacred conse	142.85711302646553
no human being not even my sister is aware of its existence	147.4169070693332
valentine will you permit me to make a confidant of a friend and reveal to him t	29.262309856210866
valentine started	233.47620760851487
a friend maximilian and who is this friend i tremble to give my permission	100.23507688523787
listen valentine	24.89538833879899
have you never experienced for anyone that sudden and irresistible sympathy whic	208.65755753431802
well that is precisely the feeling which i experienced when i first saw that ext	84.84086300466168
extraordinary did you say	39.48335694829545
you have known him for some time then	47.3574068982626
scarcely longer than eight or ten days	127.11289229298458
and do you call a man your friend whom you have only known for eight or ten days	55.879263785080866
your logic is most powerful valentine but say what you will i can never renounce	165.26845058081415
i feel as if it were ordained that this man should be associated with all the go	72.06516106201306
he must be a prophet then said valentine smiling	29.979809529565816
indeed said maximilian i have often been almost tempted to attribute to him the 	33.76791139087772
ah said valentine in a mournful tone do let me see this man maximilian he may te	25.922293456444297
my poor girl you know him already	89.24198426429834
i know him	43.86283469228809
yes it was he who saved the life of your stepmother and her son	31.30172268371953
the count of monte cristo	4.801545179336268
the same	107.20043003641243
ah cried valentine he is too much the friend of madame de villefort ever to be m	31.481436062911786
the friend of madame de villefort it can not be surely valentine you are mistake	64.82108001790225
no indeed i am not for i assure you his power over our household is almost unlim	104.43364993682366
courted by my stepmother who regards him as the epitome of human wisdom admired 	159.03020950514147
de monte cristo appears to exert a mysterious and almost uncontrollable influenc	59.25711247996531
if such be the case my dear valentine you must yourself have felt or at all even	94.90975952041748
he meets albert de morcerf in italyit is to rescue him from the hands of the ban	41.02358277219249
this man evidently possesses the power of influencing events both as regards men	237.67390376558964
i never saw more simple tastes united to greater magnificence	705.0761000755983
his smile is so sweet when he addresses me that i forget it ever can be bitter t	106.42382246282966
ah valentine tell me if he ever looked on you with one of those sweet smiles if 	56.601961718808134
me said the young girl he never even glances at me on the contrary if i accident	57.76811706030226
ah he is not generous neither does he possess that supernatural penetration whic	223.1335862748335
you say he loves you maximilian how do you know that he does all would pay defer	72.94329717587941
ah valentine i assure you you are mistaken	29.2321791522072
if it were otherwiseif he treated me diplomaticallythat is to say like a man who	41.35582442577337
who knows but that in order to please madame de villefort and my father he may n	40.156997420127226
ah forgive me said valentine perceiving the effect which her words were producin	82.11769589169367
i do not deny the influence of which you speak or that i have not myself experie	34.78838283564747
well valentine said morrel with a sigh we will not discuss the matter further	32.72330954601304
i will not make a confidant of him	24.264958434697775
alas said valentine i see that i have given you pain	21.184213822102045
i can only say how sincerely i ask pardon for having grieved you	88.65320196384947
but indeed i am not prejudiced beyond the power of conviction	92.0293987839775
tell me what this count of monte cristo has done for you	18.748334062195042
30157 m	1.0561267153358687
i own that your question embarrasses me valentine for i can not say that the cou	54.57322775940812

my friendship for him is as strange and unaccountable as his for me	164.0438706269053

in his most simple actions as well as in his most secret thoughts i find a relat	79.09195720628172
you will perhaps smile at me when i tell you that ever since i have known this m	54.656237682883
however i have managed to live thirty years without this protection you will say	83.67848755187141
he invited me to dine with him on saturday which was a very natural thing for hi	60.09933424575259
well what have i learned since that your mother and m	113.35381685080652
de villefort are both coming to this dinner	70.26277121304817
i shall meet them there and who knows what future advantages may result from the	156.82731000050086

and madame de villefort and sometimes i confess i have gone so far as to try to 	43.34845815911338
my good friend said valentine i should take you for a visionary and should tremb	28.477645891404034
is it possible that you can see anything more than the merest chance in this mee	28.984444810402504
my father who never goes out has several times been on the point of refusing thi	87.37807627450105
no no it is as i have said maximilianthere is no one in the world of whom i can 	14.773243721776286
i see that you are right logically speaking said maximilian but the gentle voice	58.87848199474479
i feel the same as regards yourself	97.48188974370936
said valentine and i own that if you have no stronger proof to give me	39.62069442390957
i have another replied maximilian but i fear you will deem it even more absurd t	53.34434728373586
so much the worse said valentine smiling	8.328223145011066
it is nevertheless conclusive to my mind	73.28677634066116
my ten years of service have also confirmed my ideas on the subject of sudden in	190.2279908714468
dear maximilian why not attribute your escape to my constant prayers for your sa	82.84506365133703
30159 m	1.7002363349898408
yes since you have known me said morrel smiling but that can not apply to the ti	43.657144640291335
you are very provoking and will not give me credit for anything but let me hear 	37.21585877301391
well look through this opening and you will see the beautiful new horse which i 	110.33032419405696
ah what a beautiful creature cried valentine why did you not bring him close to 	48.21483996520149
he is as you see a very valuable animal said maximilian	52.57711708564188
you know that my means are limited and that i am what would be designated a man 	75.83919084095416
well i went to a horse dealers where i saw this magnificent horse which i have n	48.53293693902352
i asked the price they told me it was 4500 francs	59.74796295957444
i was therefore obliged to give it up as you may imagine but i own i went away w	69.12497773157934
the same evening some friends of mine visited mem	178.50252333079607
de chteaurenaud m	15.775135704749195
debray and five or six other choice spirits whom you do not know even by name	120.7309838452692
they proposed a game of bouillotte	117.20148620035141
i never play for i am not rich enough to afford to lose or sufficiently poor to 	127.9020777560197
but i was at my own house you understand so there was nothing to be done but to 	41.76643789227719
just as they were sitting down to table m	61.3242971117739
de monte cristo arrived	24.26547332446571
he took his seat amongst them they played and i won	211.38842120367698
i am almost ashamed to say that my gains amounted to 5000 francs	37.61564999222442
we separated at midnight	295.53181412735216
i could not defer my pleasure so i took a cabriolet and drove to the horse deale	74.82397387625909
feverish and excited i rang at the door	80.01339372362814
the person who opened it must have taken me for a madman for i rushed at once to	59.29846542038975
mdah was standing at the rack eating his hay	96.33893285345296
i immediately put on the saddle and bridle to which operation he lent himself wi	216.78038542223587
as i rode by the counts house i perceived a light in one of the windows and fanc	48.487425800658464
now valentine i firmly believe that he knew of my wish to possess this horse and	130.86303342450108
my dear maximilian you are really too fanciful you will not love even me long	60.29673601568856
a man who accustoms himself to live in such a world of poetry and imagination mu	38.54009261851005
but they are calling me	74.40084621812014
do you hear	9.071673923214119
ah valentine said maximilian give me but one finger through this opening in the 	53.712073559479734
maximilian we said we would be to each other as two voices two shadows	196.02255192236905
as you will valentine	40.02875550632466
shall you be happy if i do what you wish	27.58838176152058
oh yes	12.396374854655386
valentine mounted on a bench and passed not only her finger but her whole hand t	117.59194016822504
maximilian uttered a cry of delight and springing forwards seized the hand exten	41.465840446173495
the little hand was then immediately withdrawn and the young man saw valentine h	67.6308097268216

noirtier de villefort	19.37370585764538
we will now relate what was passing in the house of the kings attorney after the	36.422430340688436
de villefort entered his fathers room followed by madame de villefort	22.763091456860682
both of the visitors after saluting the old man and speaking to barrois a faithf	59.23058604147805
noirtier was sitting in an armchair which moved upon casters in which he was whe	40.05268846088025
he was placed before a large glass which reflected the whole apartment and so wi	77.20757204501933
noirtier although almost as immovable as a corpse looked at the newcomers with a	87.1820953673262
sight and hearing were the only senses remaining and they like two solitary spar	189.96258382849277
noirtiers hair was long and white and flowed over his shoulders while in his eye	102.42202252824059
he commanded with it it was the medium through which his thanks were conveyed	190.48259641222955
in short his whole appearance produced on the mind the impression of a corpse wi	72.5446055769272
three persons only could understand this language of the poor paralytic these we	373.39630056951114
but as villefort saw his father but seldom and then only when absolutely obliged	236.58750286936314
valentine by means of her love her patience and her devotion had learned to read	131.1814748634791
to this dumb language which was so unintelligible to others she answered by thro	118.0279790736893
valentine had solved the problem and was able easily to understand his thoughts 	99.91626118692052
as to the servant he had as we have said been with his master for fiveandtwenty 	57.740137117992454
villefort did not need the help of either valentine or the domestic in order to 	57.2340057406005
as we have said he perfectly understood the old mans vocabulary and if he did no	36.296715561396354
he therefore allowed valentine to go into the garden sent away barrois and after	92.59520355371079
i trust you will not be displeased sir that valentine has not come with us or th	36.87576040979633
madame de villefort and i have a communication to make to you	20.937809608675565
noirtiers face remained perfectly passive during this long preamble while on the	278.2391265083238
this communication continued the procureur in that cold and decisive tone which 	196.5083600382383
the eye of the invalid still retained that vacancy of expression which prevented	88.54918655856747
sir resumed villefort we are thinking of marrying valentine	47.319315486575725
had the old mans face been moulded in wax it could not have shown less emotion a	171.3111090363099
the marriage will take place in less than three months said villefort	54.60265417474133
noirtiers eye still retained its inanimate expression	372.5355359500963
madame de villefort now took her part in the conversation and added	60.646129054251844
we thought this news would possess an interest for you sir who have always enter	240.4503029697645
it is one of the most desirable connections which could possibly be formed he po	47.35761013464062
it is m	24.12697564490024

while his wife was speaking villefort had narrowly watched the old mans countena	73.18696910215725
when madame de villefort pronounced the name of franz the pupil of m	22.405673392937082
noirtiers eye began to dilate and his eyelids trembled with the same movement th	67.06976184449248
the procureur who knew the political hatred which had formerly existed between m	182.7504893961864
noirtier and the elder dpinay well understood the agitation and anger which the 	108.6458665501702
sir said he you are aware that valentine is about to enter her nineteenth year w	34.81241112392834
nevertheless you have not been forgotten in our plans and we have fully ascertai	37.59486728612897
30165 m	1.0400305996093633
noirtiers look was furious it was very evident that something desperate was pass	280.2835563952666
villefort quietly opened a window saying it is very warm and the heat affects m	88.71426539958371
he then returned to his place but did not sit down	28.44224656881318
this marriage added madame de villefort is quite agreeable to the wishes of m	34.28259152406381
dpinay and his family besides he had no relations nearer than an uncle and aunt 	218.96819830272668
that assassination was a mysterious affair said villefort and the perpetrators h	55.445571186508246
noirtier made such an effort that his lips expanded into a smile	57.72609717734905
now continued villefort those to whom the guilt really belongs by whom the crime	183.3131597432553
noirtier had succeeded in mastering his emotion more than could have been deemed	126.96139166049437
yes i understand was the reply contained in his look and this look expressed a f	98.46129290881801
villefort fully understood his fathers meaning and answered by a slight shrug of	94.67119604116112
he then motioned to his wife to take leave	43.75867423141005
now sir said madame de villefort i must bid you farewell	28.74099577460534
would you like me to send edward to you for a short time	23.252110955740612
it had been agreed that the old man should express his approbation by closing hi	109.59995329735223
if he wanted valentine he closed his right eye only and if barrois the left	134.51826913750085
at madame de villeforts proposition he instantly winked his eyes	75.6112374470696
provoked by a complete refusal she bit her lip and said then shall i send valent	226.497147995043
and madame de villefort bowed and left the room giving orders that valentine sho	25.679137753279456
valentine with a color still heightened by emotion entered the room just after h	141.90167551098128
one look was sufficient to tell her that her grandfather was suffering and that 	86.8944377838372
dear grandpapa cried she what has happened they have vexed you and you are angry	67.53371360819104
the paralytic closed his eyes in token of assent	33.12112129733368
who has displeased you is it my father	36.180214934699436
madame de villefort	1.6869698981104821
me the former sign was repeated	440.9681137945273
are you displeased with me cried valentine in astonishment	31.020928935868337
noirtier again closed his eyes	103.03570402189825
and what have i done dear grandpapa that you should be angry with me cried valen	33.20858186546215
there was no answer and she continued	46.841455758320436
i have not seen you all day	48.2126329154991
has anyone been speaking to you against me	61.54796441881607

no no said noirtiers look	28.789984079909328
ah you frighten me	11.239507471697673

ah i know said she lowering her voice and going close to the old man	51.670187049496676
they have been speaking of my marriagehave they not	59.43887893201341
yes replied the angry look	134.97490894797767
i understand you are displeased at the silence i have preserved on the subject	61.45895657864288
the reason of it was that they had insisted on my keeping the matter a secret an	112.59768580911728
they did not even acquaint me with their intentions and i only discovered them b	93.09148202782595
pray forgive me	51.33516268645244
but there was no look calculated to reassure her all it seemed to say was it is 	87.14556153282781
what is it then asked the young girl	7.813286721125361
perhaps you think i shall abandon you dear grandpapa and that i shall forget you	44.808590520726106
they told you then that m	103.84412016426273
dpinay consented to our all living together	561.0471213706278
then why are you still vexed and grieved the old mans eyes beamed with an expres	45.93941378527263
yes i understand said valentine it is because you love me	20.772527590282714
the old man assented	41.03995907291189
and you are afraid i shall be unhappy	38.324534136811934
you do not like m	32.71864437529835
franz the eyes repeated several times no no no	158.5277113167962
then you are vexed with the engagement	55.09473642726452
well listen said valentine throwing herself on her knees and putting her arm rou	25.399367781393128
franz dpinay	309.21709350045546
an expression of intense joy illumined the old mans eyes	31.15834621717753
when i wished to retire into a convent you remember how angry you were with me a	88.0965708682104
well continued valentine the reason of my proposing it was that i might escape t	53.337289103390745
noirtiers breathing came thick and short	1388.1011655185064
then the idea of this marriage really grieves you too ah if you could but help m	123.69538609142096
alas you who would have been such a powerful protector to me in the days of your	49.20251960917012
however this is much and calls for gratitude and heaven has not taken away all m	186.83707999522406
at these words there appeared in noirtiers eye an expression of such deep meanin	39.99751241877795
do you think you can help me dear grandpapa said valentine	15.5207815424756
noirtier raised his eyes it was the sign agreed on between him and valentine whe	50.76507722783261
what is it you want dear grandpapa said valentine and she endeavored to recall t	29.889690691216344
she then recited all the letters of the alphabet from a down to n	66.32464061577934
when she arrived at that letter the paralytic made her understand that she had s	88.30525995612602
ah said valentine the thing you desire begins with the letter n it is with n tha	38.22860330305032
well let me see what can you want that begins with n nanenino	47.2448127568915
yes yes yes said the old mans eye	29.534824223758857
ah it is no then	39.46153292278998
valentine fetched a dictionary which she placed on a desk before noirtier she op	92.21156178754616
during the six years which had passed since noirtier first fell into this sad st	77.99633173691824
at the word notary noirtier made a sign to her to stop	32.588164959874014
30169 m	1.359086878303723
notary said she do you want a notary dear grandpapa the old man again signified 	58.73790785382392
you would wish a notary to be sent for then said valentine	60.83291039104213
shall my father be informed of your wish	67.81222684021685
do you wish the notary to be sent for immediately	38.145615668874164
then they shall go for him directly dear grandpapa	110.19856328062515
is that all you want	46.14902348268013
valentine rang the bell and ordered the servant to tell monsieur or madame de vi	62.97491263470768
noirtiers room	2556.5259177741245
are you satisfied now inquired valentine	15.319557316374183
i am sure you are it is not very difficult to discover that	40.804318365089415
and the young girl smiled on her grandfather as if he had been a child	19.1115082528106
de villefort entered followed by barrois	37.47096584959459
what do you want me for sir demanded he of the paralytic	25.809014724008545
sir said valentine my grandfather wishes for a notary	36.5843946121648
at this strange and unexpected demand m	300.7828192263405
de villefort and his father exchanged looks	58.42195745441842
yes motioned the latter with a firmness which seemed to declare that with the he	53.35947146639457
do you wish for a notary asked villefort	13.089594956742646
what to do	128.19968122286508
noirtier made no answer	100.1852382506568
what do you want with a notary again repeated villefort	36.181974688723024
the invalids eye remained fixed by which expression he intended to intimate that	182.80138754156454
is it to do us some ill turn do you think it is worth while said villefort	80.16099242587794
still said barrois with the freedom and fidelity of an old servant if m	59.48115287304215
noirtier asks for a notary i suppose he really wishes for a notary therefore i s	155.7730907770351
barrois acknowledged no master but noirtier and never allowed his desires in any	154.64519117842457
30171 m	1.694061760706202
yes i do want a notary motioned the old man shutting his eyes with a look of def	38.95597622349122
you shall have a notary as you absolutely wish for one sir said villefort but i 	51.44291988586037
never mind that said barrois i shall go and fetch a notary nevertheless	36.48839993311241
and the old servant departed triumphantly on his mission	114.06611760664636
chapter 59	2064.9418035398994
the will	3145.043954849362
as soon as barrois had left the room noirtier looked at valentine with a malicio	10.816226791814676
the young girl perfectly understood the look and so did villefort for his counte	67.50766674192944
he took a seat and quietly awaited the arrival of the notary	50.232834767080625
noirtier saw him seat himself with an appearance of perfect indifference at the 	57.76255303934858
threequarters of an hour after barrois returned bringing the notary with him	32.973058620982954
sir said villefort after the first salutations were over you were sent for by m	37.55028332527285
noirtier whom you see here	129.87554835690855
all his limbs have become completely paralysed he has lost his voice also and we	200.68669043768935
noirtier cast an appealing look on valentine which look was at once so earnest a	77.06221443247226
sir said she i perfectly understand my grandfathers meaning at all times	100.645525046081
that is quite true said barrois and that is what i told the gentleman as we walk	31.573628929838904
permit me said the notary turning first to villefort and then to valentinepermit	29.09619402481906
the first thing necessary to render an act valid is that the notary should be th	99.1078894558184
now i can not be sure of the approbation or disapprobation of a client who can n	37.726868173450505
the notary then prepared to retire	191.955241932895
an imperceptible smile of triumph was expressed on the lips of the procureur	27.787509741666728
noirtier looked at valentine with an expression so full of grief that she arrest	29.982389976048495
sir said she the language which i speak with my grandfather may be easily learnt	103.12447328068313
will you tell me what you require in order to set your conscience quite at ease 	59.61119655695239
in order to render an act valid i must be certain of the approbation or disappro	43.824670188701134
illness of body would not affect the validity of the deed but sanity of mind is 	76.41913623109895
well sir by the help of two signs with which i will acquaint you presently you m	95.07672166464168
noirtier being deprived of voice and motion is accustomed to convey his meaning 	181.18907366322563
you now know quite enough to enable you to converse with m	118.52140242524354
noirtier gave valentine such a look of tenderness and gratitude that it was comp	23.007113738238445
you have heard and understood what your granddaughter has been saying sir have y	106.74823294410179
noirtier closed his eyes	37.02360990726034
and you approve of what she saidthat is to say you declare that the signs which 	132.81377561651402
it was you who sent for me	21.437846548427743
to make your will	148.20955520062753
and you do not wish me to go away without fulfilling your original intentions th	46.888887378996294
well sir said the young girl do you understand now and is your conscience perfec	31.38035350563334
but before the notary could answer villefort had drawn him aside	121.65329046571198
sir said he do you suppose for a moment that a man can sustain a physical shock 	38.43115892078837
noirtier has received without any detriment to his mental faculties	101.28501957417896
it is not exactly that sir said the notary which makes me uneasy but the difficu	43.997275530938474
you must see that to be an utter impossibility said villefort	40.774316953816786
valentine and the old man heard this conversation and noirtier fixed his eye so 	46.65065143739093
sir said she that need not make you uneasy however difficult it may at first sig	167.219772212224
i can discover and explain to you my grandfathers thoughts so as to put an end t	97.48049526406504
i have now been six years with m	67.48211258955783
noirtier and let him tell you if ever once during that time he has entertained a	84.38820711472445
no signed the old man	33.76715461499735
let us try what we can do then said the notary	22.056160011579333
you accept this young lady as your interpreter m	148.64943205635768
well sir what do you require of me and what document is it that you wish to be d	30.632299945485965
valentine named all the letters of the alphabet until she came to w	48.96526334965882
at this letter the eloquent eye of noirtier gave her notice that she was to stop	35.054110147051844
it is very evident that it is the letter w which m	21.941615946780978
noirtier wants said the notary	125.22259416387321
wait said valentine and turning to her grandfather she repeated wawewi the old m	50.99172041622148
valentine then took the dictionary and the notary watched her while she turned o	55.77132144660034
she passed her finger slowly down the columns and when she came to the word will	101.4437493995002
noirtiers eye bade her stop	562.6266865159856
will said the notary it is very evident that m	23.074539204368953
noirtier is desirous of making his will	204.08202094024512
yes yes yes motioned the invalid	61.90053436754433
really sir you must allow that this is most extraordinary said the astonished no	101.67770461839338
de villefort	1.0499453532183332
yes said the procureur and i think the will promises to be yet more extraordinar	48.839902792759716
no no no replied the eye of the paralytic	14.635348484778987
what said villefort do you mean to say that valentine is not interested in your 	19.70261318666723
sir said the notary whose interest had been greatly excited and who had resolved	82.25603568190832
as to the time it will not require very much more than the generality of wills	47.08325912562519
there are certain forms necessary to be gone through and which are always the sa	92.14541082855999
as to the details the greater part will be furnished afterwards by the state in 	123.38487941525302
but besides all this in order that the instrument may not be contested i am anxi	54.230382283078356
are you satisfied sir continued the notary addressing the old man	16.511602575155724
30175 m	1.0524921412792911
yes looked the invalid his eye beaming with delight at the ready interpretation 	176.75374287017198
what is he going to do thought villefort whose position demanded much reserve bu	222.70011524795584
he left the room to give orders for another notary to be sent but barrois who ha	57.324739285761
the procureur then told his wife to come up	83.64848736976901
in the course of a quarter of an hour everyone had assembled in the chamber of t	18.39536783057182
a few words sufficed for a mutual understanding between the two officers of the 	68.24895852385168
they read to noirtier the formal copy of a will in order to give him an idea of 	51.64583786337771
when an individual makes his will it is generally in favor or in prejudice of so	134.49075447220093
have you an exact idea of the amount of your fortune	29.169207996320026
i will name to you several sums which will increase by gradation you will stop m	218.89543511014944
there was a kind of solemnity in this interrogation	38.382334432696545
never had the struggle between mind and matter been more apparent than now and i	265.78098261025616
they had formed a circle round the invalid the second notary was sitting at a ta	124.09161535906846
your fortune exceeds 300000 francs does it not asked he	124.51826353514748
noirtier made a sign that it did	21.569072334572603
do you possess 400000 francs inquired the notary	41.77830938968055
noirtiers eye remained immovable	379.9606778777197
500000 the same expression continued	430.4683041001002
noirtier stopped him at the lastnamed sum	119.12834425673564
you are then in possession of 900000 francs asked the notary	39.71037512087731
in landed property	21365.280484085677
in stock	2590.2111750203794
the stock is in your own hands	118.52179803376481
the look which m	724.1155100440903
noirtier cast on barrois showed that there was something wanting which he knew w	88.59560239266106
the old servant left the room and presently returned bringing with him a small c	71.1017193645913
do you permit us to open this casket asked the notary	43.05208409417803
noirtier gave his assent	141.23210108466154
they opened it and found 900000 francs in bank scrip	140.92581320491695
the first notary handed over each note as he examined it to his colleague	137.53503294909828
the total amount was found to be as m	378.14165683046235
noirtier had stated	248.10703000806933
it is all as he has said it is very evident that the mind still retains its full	57.91755415833813
then turning towards the paralytic he said you possess then 900000 francs of cap	108.13888428463818
to whom do you desire to leave this fortune	38.289536066024034
oh said madame de villefort there is not much doubt on that subject	29.83319017990448
noirtier tenderly loves his granddaughter mademoiselle de villefort it is she wh	191.90838358040395
the eye of noirtier clearly showed by its expression that he was not deceived by	37.711948773749896
is it then to mademoiselle valentine de villefort that you leave these 900000 fr	53.052273173065764
valentine when her name was made the subject of discussion had stepped back to e	118.46512644278832
the old man looked at her for an instant with an expression of the deepest tende	14.048433444633046
what said the notary do you not intend making mademoiselle valentine de villefor	39.901826891574196
you are not making any mistake are you said the notary you really mean to declar	66.2913151309278
no repeated noirtier no	86.01376580306972
valentine raised her head struck dumb with astonishment	166.13157487805663
it was not so much the conviction that she was disinherited that caused her grie	41.527675422631994
but noirtier looked at her with so much affectionate tenderness that she exclaim	49.7734361941535
oh grandpapa i see now that it is only your fortune of which you deprive me you 	71.35189489881553
ah yes most assuredly said the eyes of the paralytic for he closed them with an 	66.28647895250921
thank you thank you murmured she	104.88949543284915
the old mans declaration that valentine was not the destined inheritor of his fo	43.903984174217506
then doubtless dear m	709.9557988898363
noirtier you intend leaving your fortune to your grandson edward de villefort	102.34064088734355
the winking of the eyes which answered this speech was most decided and terrible	220.03747537309476
no said the notary then perhaps it is to your son m	67.35461532099636
de villefort	1.0547165887443337
the two notaries looked at each other in mute astonishment and inquiry as to wha	45.20460444100676
villefort and his wife both grew red one from shame the other from anger	293.4060997395539
what have we all done then dear grandpapa said valentine you no longer seem to l	50.38818136863835
the old mans eyes passed rapidly from villefort and his wife and rested on valen	37.707246654023045
well said she if you love me grandpapa try and bring that love to bear upon your	125.77332002718259
you know me well enough to be quite sure that i have never thought of your fortu	26.192500448418993
explain yourself then	79.42415883500318
noirtier fixed his intelligent eyes on valentines hand	110.91277139332719
my hand said she	85.53506842099351
her hand exclaimed everyone	577.206491425377
oh gentlemen you see it is all useless and that my fathers mind is really impair	49.00834852313455
ah cried valentine suddenly i understand	28.98310421795743
it is my marriage you mean is it not dear grandpapa	63.63580653000516
yes yes yes signed the paralytic casting on valentine a look of joyful gratitude	89.68342015647733
30179 m	1.097198127140309
you are angry with us all on account of this marriage are you not	42.38390592744835
really this is too absurd said villefort	35.77711404026802
excuse me sir replied the notary on the contrary the meaning of m	22.332027996649977
noirtier is quite evident to me and i can quite easily connect the train of idea	115.46937204400362
you do not wish me to marry m	23.487551025382853
franz dpinay observed valentine	201.12967170605273
i do not wish it said the eye of her grandfather	24.60503149735589
and you disinherit your granddaughter continued the notary because she has contr	67.62161941962226
so that but for this marriage she would have been your heir	107.48286586923831
there was a profound silence	16.365052798131572
the two notaries were holding a consultation as to the best means of proceeding 	112.69259736221707
valentine was looking at her grandfather with a smile of intense gratitude and v	21.217463459704653
but said villefort who was the first to break the silence i consider that i am t	29.183878685094392
i am the only person possessing the right to dispose of my daughters hand	139.87540043288467
it is my wish that she should marry m	63.46199163347501

valentine sank weeping into a chair	79.89608191974264
sir said the notary how do you intend disposing of your fortune in case mademois	43.88959368553618
franz the old man gave no answer	49.308069043831004
you will of course dispose of it in some way or other	73.10761859385602
in favor of some member of your family	103.5917434434311
do you intend devoting it to charitable purposes then pursued the notary	132.13477720355957
but said the notary you are aware that the law does not allow a son to be entire	47.024956206653506
you only intend then to dispose of that part of your fortune which the law allow	147.0850021965084
do you still wish to dispose of all	65.23263750885832
but they will contest the will after your death	198.00209788904027
my father knows me replied villefort he is quite sure that his wishes will be he	30.257094104583427
the eye of noirtier beamed with triumph	57.23329617118215
what do you decide on sir asked the notary of villefort	31.74976314625307
nothing sir it is a resolution which my father has taken and i know he never alt	42.2049192105362
i am quite resigned	95.89596377266939
these 900000 francs will go out of the family in order to enrich some hospital b	49.90688017963392
having said this villefort quitted the room with his wife leaving his father at 	65.0078230942998
the same day the will was made the witnesses were brought it was approved by the	73.30033658799996

the telegraph	1027.418309984081
and madame de villefort found on their return that the count of monte cristo who	20.76762513793186
madame de villefort who had not yet sufficiently recovered from her late emotion	49.772724184530134
although m	70.99530679274974
de villefort flattered himself that to all outward view he had completely masked	273.24132448864765
ma foi said monte cristo after the first compliments were over what is the matte	31.711627041975675
de villefort have i arrived at the moment when you were drawing up an indictment	45.90156552159285
villefort tried to smile	63.86364107482026
no count he replied i am the only victim in this case	62.743486713994955
it is i who lose my cause and it is illluck obstinacy and folly which have cause	130.4246580088388
to what do you refer said monte cristo with wellfeigned interest	37.210153902067944
have you really met with some great misfortune	99.94161089628304
oh no monsieur said villefort with a bitter smile it is only a loss of money whi	18.084259926167142
true said monte cristo the loss of a sum of money becomes almost immaterial with	67.13666820654642
it is not so much the loss of the money that vexes me said villefort though afte	29.37365966199581
30183 m	1.1568936177748343
what do you say said the count 900000 francs it is indeed a sum which might be r	23.497403259910502
and who is the cause of all this annoyance	41.35878253063133
my father as i told you	14.365681438933759
noirtier but i thought you told me he had become entirely paralyzed and that all	82.08179698389684
yes his bodily faculties for he can neither move nor speak nevertheless he think	300.44853935922816
i left him about five minutes ago and he is now occupied in dictating his will t	94.5421307078256
but to do this he must have spoken	105.93029024303667
he has done better than thathe has made himself understood	108.63110273330082
how was such a thing possible	63.7346830613206
by the help of his eyes which are still full of life and as you perceive possess	62.71378474956039
my dear said madame de villefort who had just entered the room perhaps you exagg	25.07372770251274
goodmorning madame said the count bowing	17.608529363751725
madame de villefort acknowledged the salutation with one of her most gracious sm	22.922898487464366
what is this that m	51.86483781316259
de villefort has been telling me demanded monte cristo and what incomprehensible	45.737603774390955
incomprehensible is the word interrupted the procureur shrugging his shoulders	59.77879714602478
it is an old mans caprice	52.71410617396928
and is there no means of making him revoke his decision	120.79259841288518
yes said madame de villefort and it is still entirely in the power of my husband	22.584725332364833
the count who perceived that m	80.51373044184363
and madame de villefort were beginning to speak in parables appeared to pay no a	64.30679451581376
my dear said villefort in answer to his wife you know i have never been accustom	37.671941057806976
nevertheless it is necessary that my will should be respected in my family and t	45.111388071197986
the baron dpinay was my friend as you know and an alliance with his son is the m	92.52921858948702
do you think said madame de villefort that valentine is in league with him she h	27.498704358128567
madame said villefort believe me a fortune of 900000 francs is not so easily ren	43.541958342619644
she could nevertheless make up her mind to renounce the world sir since it is on	115.34665330734701
never mind replied villefort i say that this marriage shall be consummated	41.07196748077053
notwithstanding your fathers wishes to the contrary said madame de villefort sel	26.866648559343197
that is a serious thing	12.830731173329765
monte cristo who pretended not to be listening heard however every word that was	175.09238006092764
30185 m	1.0137484073806868
madame replied villefort i can truly say that i have always entertained a high r	40.822008625517086
the name of father is sacred in two senses he should be reverenced as the author	102.68251659171978
but under the present circumstances i am justified in doubting the wisdom of an 	94.44120272867784
it would be ridiculous in me to regulate my conduct by such caprices	72.97185884941733
i shall still continue to preserve the same respect toward m	196.92333739418936
noirtier i will suffer without complaint the pecuniary deprivation to which he h	167.09829777540702
consequently i shall marry my daughter to the baron franz dpinay because i consi	56.94854342883915
what said the count the approbation of whose eye villefort had frequently solici	95.47947696931912
what do you say that m	12.200617190449261
noirtier disinherits mademoiselle de villefort because she is going to marry m	38.85989158714275
le baron franz dpinay	117.04890499063772
yes sir that is the reason said villefort shrugging his shoulders	22.543043821442513
the apparent reason at least said madame de villefort	46.940440548354104
the real reason madame i can assure you i know my father	59.19690131366514
but i want to know in what way m	59.24033079679789
dpinay can have displeased your father more than any other person	80.00854839371341
i believe i know m	63.591489505776465
franz dpinay said the count is he not the son of general de quesnel who was crea	18.040627278275213
the same said villefort	70.22287939658017
well but he is a charming young man according to my ideas	40.62646139831616
he is which makes me believe that it is only an excuse of m	72.72803612979311
noirtier to prevent his granddaughter marrying old men are always so selfish in 	165.39553491193792
but said monte cristo do you not know any cause for this hatred	30.706474376264882
ah ma foi who is to know	78.64398170128439
perhaps it is some political difference	204.11793292530575
my father and the baron dpinay lived in the stormy times of which i only saw the	77.57102008121286
was not your father a bonapartist asked monte cristo i think i remember that you	24.5981102409486
my father has been a jacobin more than anything else said villefort carried by h	45.98812483136123
when my father conspired it was not for the emperor it was against the bourbons 	51.95802158077709
noirtier possessed this peculiarity he never projected any utopian schemes which	346.7545139095174
well said monte cristo it is just as i thought it was politics which brought noi	35.30501158934913
dpinay into personal contact	2483.507509639286
although general dpinay served under napoleon did he not still retain royalist s	590.535413481537
villefort looked at the count almost with terror	35.33543665197145
am i mistaken then said monte cristo	18.215614003472517
no sir the facts were precisely what you have stated said madame de villefort an	66.31894817050907
de villefort formed the idea of uniting in the bonds of affection the two childr	40.86065609504765
it was a sublime and charitable thought said monte cristo and the whole world sh	53.40176305562604
it would be noble to see mademoiselle noirtier de villefort assuming the title o	33.24266060892745
villefort shuddered and looked at monte cristo as if he wished to read in his co	17.559771920099788
but the count completely baffled the procureur and prevented him from discoverin	87.92538791544273
although said villefort it will be a serious thing for valentine to lose her gra	18.384928210253236
dpinay will be frightened at this pecuniary loss	117.49531140719779
he will perhaps hold me in greater esteem than the money itself seeing that i sa	144.30416823900737
besides he knows that valentine is rich in right of her mother and that she will	45.39072802229883
and madame de saintmran her mothers parents who both love her tenderly	119.65266714330343
and who are fully as well worth loving and tending as m	172.53184647885
noirtier said madame de villefort besides they are to come to paris in about a m	38.42989448867168
the count listened with satisfaction to this tale of wounded selflove and defeat	179.39036260978008
but it seems to me said monte cristo and i must begin by asking your pardon for 	21.177815538764442
noirtier disinherits mademoiselle de villefort because she is going to marry a m	46.75616627706075
true said madame de villefort with an intonation of voice which it is impossible	20.13041461518197
noirtiers grandchild as valentine and yet if she had not been going to marry m	54.73565449510304
franz m	263.2160449610716
noirtier would have left her all his money and supposing valentine to be disinhe	53.76482156507267
the count listened and said no more	90.3233953042948
count said villefort we will not entertain you any longer with our family misfor	31.331991955973223
it is true that my patrimony will go to endow charitable institutions and my fat	66.8911284370774
dpinay to whom i had promised the interest of this sum shall receive it even if 	84.60888653037884
however said madame de villefort returning to the one idea which incessantly occ	46.57006161335486
dpinay in order to give him the opportunity of himself renouncing his claim to t	53.28968668856675
ah that would be a great pity said villefort	21.867598016905678
a great pity said monte cristo	27.731009136079575
undoubtedly said villefort moderating the tones of his voice a marriage once con	62.38043390699842
no it will all go well m	303.09462417400783
dpinay if he is an honorable man will consider himself more than ever pledged to	77.81174569485917
i agree with m	399.7834109590772
de villefort said monte cristo fixing his eyes on madame de villefort and if i w	12.440321442504962
dpinay is coming back to settle this affair at once beyond all possibility of re	271.85671763836
i will answer for the success of a project which will reflect so much honor on m	72.83718475943425
de villefort	1.0486918686102646
the procureur arose delighted with the proposition but his wife slightly changed	233.38504603275103
well that is all that i wanted and i will be guided by a counsellor such as you 	43.102018624497376
therefore let everyone here look upon what has passed today as if it had not hap	204.33119918307554
sir said the count the world unjust as it is will be pleased with your resolutio	51.738726845021695
dpinay even if he took mademoiselle de villefort without any dowry which he will	75.43862676267025
at the conclusion of these words the count rose to depart	40.13001689072086
are you going to leave us count said madame de villefort	9.759523150664291
i am sorry to say i must do so madame i only came to remind you of your promise 	42.574917440791786
did you fear that we should forget it	47.16257806071381
you are very good madame but m	56.423462547574196
de villefort has so many important and urgent occupations	142.7325085690021
my husband has given me his word sir said madame de villefort you have just seen	19.929225283277123
and said villefort is it at your house in the champslyses that you receive your 	32.84240244616273
no said monte cristo which is precisely the reason which renders your kindness m	69.86483738200322
in the country	32.0919136706522
where is it then near paris is it not	22.629380983102454
very near only half a league from the barriersit is at auteuil	65.35029058114947
at auteuil said villefort true madame de villefort told me you lived at auteuil 	37.87672131191807
and in what part of auteuil do you reside	57.97853749446996
rue de la fontaine	20.944050492113973
rue de la fontaine exclaimed villefort in an agitated tone at what number	47.31894318850956
then cried villefort was it you who bought m	158.20616752959825
de saintmrans house	20.548168961188924
did it belong to m	52.81360043860716
de saintmran demanded monte cristo	20.275992709259693
yes replied madame de villefort and would you believe it count	37.67075549329569
believe what	89.48022051400119
you think this house pretty do you not	174.32528433185797
i think it charming	128.45539974695316
well my husband would never live in it	90.35785751793142
indeed returned monte cristo that is a prejudice on your part m	35.29532452489725
de villefort for which i am quite at a loss to account	55.4921489533289
i do not like auteuil sir said the procureur making an evident effort to appear 	46.1399690792994
but i hope you will not carry your antipathy so far as to deprive me of the plea	33.566797438122556
no counti hopei assure you i shall do my best stammered villefort	60.47776932810974
oh said monte cristo i allow of no excuse	64.82503650339056

thank you said monte cristo now you must permit me to take my leave of you	21.146468177361314
you said before that you were obliged to leave us monsieur said madame de villef	35.087296967089465
indeed madame said monte cristo i scarcely know if i dare tell you where i am go	36.95148326892412
nonsense say on	2497.212368190123
well then it is to see a thing on which i have sometimes mused for hours togethe	52.52097612508163
what is it	5.307332300120359
a telegraph	1041.0609982183335
so now i have told my secret	78.0626724665682
a telegraph repeated madame de villefort	34.91973656432305
yes a telegraph	522.989080374533
i had often seen one placed at the end of a road on a hillock and in the light o	41.72827676784311
i began to think of genii sylphs gnomes in short of all the ministers of the occ	65.53733947423653
now it never occurred to me to wish for a nearer inspection of these large insec	126.17187362880696
but one fine day i learned that the mover of this telegraph was only a poor wret	73.47677822322862
at length i felt a desire to study this living chrysalis more closely and to end	160.44266467713828

and are you going there	29.60006665647664

ma foi i should wish to keep my illusions concerning insects unimpaired it is qu	43.4297059062269
i shall therefore not visit either of these telegraphs but one in the open count	225.13610524769646
you are a singular man said villefort	15.212923836366912
what line would you advise me to study	141.86405931824922
the one that is most in use just at this time	146.71837019918297
the spanish one you mean i suppose	251.04264991975626
yes should you like a letter to the minister that they might explain to you	51.41128605066995
no said monte cristo since as i told you before i do not wish to comprehend it	20.25011740119236
the moment i understand it there will no longer exist a telegraph for me it will	89.02360997263075

thank you	2.3051264167104386
on saturday i will tell you my impressions concerning the telegraph	48.24885509597938
at the door the count was met by the two notaries who had just completed the act	31.48363532718898
chapter 61	450.88174594729765
how a gardener may get rid of the dormice that eat his peaches	44.496854483076184

leaving the village of linas without stopping at the telegraph which flourished 	77.36921353176402
at the foot of the hill the count dismounted and began to ascend by a little win	35.31392671033965
monte cristo looked for the entrance to the enclosure and was not long in findin	39.28285986997849
the count soon mastered the mechanism the gate opened and he then found himself 	71.94625899046079
no one would have thought in looking at this old weatherbeaten floraldecked towe	53.26391396781074
the garden was crossed by a path of red gravel edged by a border of thick box of	58.49075087779999
this path was formed in the shape of the figure of 8 thus in its windings making	103.39888209372577
never had flora the fresh and smiling goddess of gardeners been honored with a p	95.18055268350624
in fact of the twenty rosetrees which formed the parterre not one bore the mark 	112.3880576965187
and yet it was not because the damp had been excluded from the garden the earth 	51.633919937887825
there was not a blade of grass to be seen in the paths or a weed in the flowerbe	37.112756183296774
monte cristo stopped after having closed the gate and fastened the string to the	47.344424159644426
the man at the telegraph said he must either engage a gardener or devote himself	167.42290487767374
suddenly he struck against something crouching behind a wheelbarrow filled with 	234.03396875615303
he had twelve leaves and about as many strawberries which on rising suddenly he 	279.67290922747856

certainly it is wrong said monte cristo but you should take into consideration t	47.216638530117315
of course said the gardener but that does not make it the less unpleasant	47.025617697077216
but sir once more i beg pardon perhaps you are an officer that i am detaining he	99.90092106551805

i have been told said the count that you do not always yourselves understand the	38.339778152411796
that is true sir and that is what i like best said the man smiling	42.30631925294518
why do you like that best	48.10644622957213
because then i have no responsibility	36.47661399758935
i am a machine then and nothing else and so long as i work nothing more is requi	106.90109776554756

monte cristo entered the tower which was divided into three stories	111.99565579607707
the tower contained implements such as spades rakes wateringpots hung against th	342.1851428580132
the second was the mans conventional abode or rather sleepingplace it contained 	123.73986693467218
does it require much study to learn the art of telegraphing asked monte cristo	123.44260955647931
the study does not take long it was acting as a supernumerary that was so tediou	82.3854940266238
and what is the pay	97.30657430323917
a thousand francs sir	80.32502519936698
it is nothing	21.25111994757302
no but then we are lodged as you perceive	79.88172048305526
monte cristo looked at the room	16.670792522216907
they passed to the third story it was the telegraph room	129.24706525714987
monte cristo looked in turn at the two iron handles by which the machine was wor	42.90289328518088
it is very interesting he said but it must be very tedious for a lifetime	31.173883561367116
at first my neck was cramped with looking at it but at the end of a year i becam	48.88953288158773
when we have a fog	50.7079574269037
ah to be sure	25.086667524335745
those are indeed holidays to me i go into the garden i plant i prune i trim i ki	82.95440271151924
how long have you been here	24.17186242864505
ten years and five as a supernumerary make fifteen	123.43566403315151
you are	5.762929900606697
fiftyfive years old	543.7100659067445
how long must you have served to claim the pension	108.01674511991217
oh sir twentyfive years	332.59412827782484
and how much is the pension	129.20639598686972
a hundred crowns	81.25671999257014
poor humanity murmured monte cristo	48.08954320025424
what did you say sir asked the man	13.557175315890772
i was saying it was very interesting	52.877126184411644
what was	23.319893023409236
all you were showing me	77.6981064326766
and you really understand none of these signals	137.78492966851806
none at all	62.369667034490206
and have you never tried to understand them	76.22025370042941
why should i	21.47313760183095
but still there are some signals only addressed to you	193.9758319864668
and do you understand them	30.030078821778517
they are always the same	45.74999318506679
and they mean	1112.212718896989
nothing new you have an hour or tomorrow	222.76500782328446
this is simple enough said the count but look is not your correspondent putting 	78.05746139490232
ah yes thank you sir	33.981449461692115
and what is it sayinganything you understand	38.73365869528354
yes it asks if i am ready	97.74501254319735
and you reply	619.1523729722155
by the same sign which at the same time tells my righthand correspondent that i 	33.50719643891387
it is very ingenious said the count	14.280980724453329
you will see said the man proudly in five minutes he will speak	45.32143363890899
i have then five minutes said monte cristo to himself it is more time than i req	27.014167385801127
my dear sir will you allow me to ask you a question	21.825345827986233
what is it sir	12.968939384402328
you are fond of gardening	35.95339136687017
and you would be pleased to have instead of this terrace of twenty feet an enclo	60.88624934818026
sir i should make a terrestrial paradise of it	54.69675323447626
you live badly on your thousand francs	390.7519232503519
badly enough but yet i do live	117.82824126394421
yes but you have a wretchedly small garden	94.47318162472585
true the garden is not large	97.6040305231291
and then such as it is it is filled with dormice who eat everything	206.17490483492014
ah they are my scourges	64.73079565337285
tell me should you have the misfortune to turn your head while your righthand co	54.269715242983395
i should not see him	17.490095185425133
then what would happen	92.08080016961219
i could not repeat the signals	106.22746135306359
and then	34.85638698225658
not having repeated them through negligence i should be fined	224.7572526503426
how much	46.298065295748884
a hundred francs	27.573730798703593
the tenth of your incomethat would be fine work	197.20016225930226
ah said the man	13.662316575216181
has it ever happened to you said monte cristo	15.05858343244154
once sir when i was grafting a rosetree	89.433639738983
well suppose you were to alter a signal and substitute another	119.55941883779944
ah that is another case i should be turned off and lose my pension	80.28826373556153
three hundred francs	8.582450482122747
a hundred crowns yes sir so you see that i am not likely to do any of these thin	55.58232088333409
not even for fifteen years wages come it is worth thinking about	217.9266659122304
for fifteen thousand francs	44.20161723027728
sir you alarm me	77.95063671368182
sir you are tempting me	67.41630854966016
just so fifteen thousand francs do you understand	58.33694177238347
sir let me see my righthand correspondent	33.94884722858303
on the contrary do not look at him but at this	28.038667707588132
what is it	5.235313566646069
what do you not know these bits of paper	31.084710661874794
exactly there are fifteen of them	60.82510790298303
and whose are they	416.40731117895206
yours if you like	35.573031227385954
mine exclaimed the man halfsuffocated	114.17810915064759
yes yoursyour own property	3064.747463552277
sir my righthand correspondent is signalling	53.4652059347128
let him signal	519.2317578199622
sir you have distracted me i shall be fined	32.32086557188682
that will cost you a hundred francs you see it is your interest to take my bankn	40.460027919430665
sir my righthand correspondent redoubles his signals he is impatient	132.7033730609036
never mindtake these and the count placed the packet in the mans hands	132.30380637884815
now this is not all he said you can not live upon your fifteen thousand francs	49.326811604916436
i shall still have my place	82.57592916348095
no you will lose it for you are going to alter your correspondents message	56.1624726224723
oh sir what are you proposing	42.38711947444744
a jest	1239.7587472412197
sir unless you force me	201.06015180021424
i think i can effectually force you and monte cristo drew another packet from hi	115.19110383984994
here are ten thousand more francs he said with the fifteen thousand already in y	84.83135654743946
with five thousand you can buy a pretty little house with two acres of land the 	81.24540688294074
a garden with two acres of land	71.16698048045286
and a thousand francs a year	54.0945856448282
oh heavens	67.89447323660559
come take them and monte cristo forced the banknotes into his hand	69.0658703406217
what am i to do	22.970528324306397
nothing very difficult	454.6373918416497
but what is it	7.667374059735104
to repeat these signs	537.7573296233408
monte cristo took a paper from his pocket upon which were drawn three signs with	73.71319838247646
there you see it will not take long	47.16375874115134
yes but	19.69220634466785
do this and you will have nectarines and all the rest	88.81021647065775
the shot told red with fever while the large drops fell from his brow the man ex	94.06812203119716
as to the lefthand one he conscientiously repeated the same signals which were f	128.8705635698144
now you are rich said monte cristo	16.931777157744616
yes replied the man but at what a price	56.761534711341376
listen friend said monte cristo	25.59763151701096
i do not wish to cause you any remorse believe me then when i swear to you that 	43.626969917365514
the man looked at the banknotes felt them counted them turned pale then red then	234.67328162343287
five minutes after the new telegram reached the minister debray had the horses p	35.703057182941464
has your husband any spanish bonds he asked of the baroness	111.25914136567945
i think so indeed he has six millions worth	98.27104772752192
he must sell them at whatever price	305.65016504093245
because don carlos has fled from bourges and has returned to spain	33.12960342904938

how do you know debray shrugged his shoulders	26.75194088219937
the idea of asking how i hear the news he said	95.38800920307276
the baroness did not wait for a repetition she ran to her husband who immediatel	57.68889408887775
when it was seen that danglars sold the spanish funds fell directly	104.85819058454251
danglars lost five hundred thousand francs but he rid himself of all his spanish	69.40796833762771
the same evening the following was read in le messager	70.52748035563513

the king don carlos has escaped the vigilance of his guardians at bourges and ha	33.13531469076074

next morning le moniteur contained the following	102.93743927321415
it was without any foundation that le messager yesterday announced the flight of	144.0426538112653

the funds rose one per cent higher than before they had fallen	149.6387431770601

at first sight the exterior of the house at auteuil gave no indications of splen	33.32373586437746
the splendor was within	948.9501008237938
indeed almost before the door opened the scene changed	108.72578137417867
bertuccio had outdone himself in the taste displayed in furnishing and in the ra	80.72647199861217

bertuccio planted an entirely bare court with poplars large spreading sycamores 	582.4058100262667
for the rest the orders had been issued by the count he himself had given a plan	48.424359156061776
thus the house had become unrecognizable and bertuccio himself declared that he 	78.8887141337131

bertuccio made amends however by loading the antechambers staircases and mantlep	188.41068894632232

when the count arrived he had under his touch his books and arms his eyes rested	78.74278219235435
the servants passed gayly along the fine courtyard some belonging to the kitchen	333.7091591407925
the library was divided into two parts on either side of the wall and contained 	62.81173781924128
on the other side of the house to match with the library was the conservatory or	56.80929923658137

yes it was proposed for the museum	96.80051746057136
which i believe does not contain one said monte cristo	55.28410882160872
no and yet they refused to buy it	101.87129018001364
why said chteaurenaud	11.25411600310853

cavalcanti said debray	8.971098317106124
a fine name said morrel	40.41873337991418

you are fastidious chteaurenaud replied debray those clothes are well cut and qu	106.60483794548547
that is just what i find fault with	139.4447302064497
that gentleman appears to be well dressed for the first time in his life	65.00940401894962
who are those gentlemen asked danglars of monte cristo	23.566861168852842

i indeed invited them here today on your account	255.5849354730049
i will introduce you to them	36.29517521566124
but they appear to speak french with a very pure accent said danglars	59.91160557040967
the son has been educated in a college in the south i believe near marseilles	67.09967107799213
you will find him quite enthusiastic	96.39150024246297
upon what subject asked madame danglars	55.07876584217802

the count watched him	39.371137576484216

bertuccio stood at the open door with his eyes starting and his hair on end	60.43300041845621
waiting for whom bertuccio without answering pointed to villefort with something	170.47829367940852
oh oh he at length muttered do you see	88.77736049308639
what who	1783.8093879233995

villefort complied and they passed on to the diningroom	128.0997109335624
chapter 63	518.3446623361604
the dinner	1364.8119526593775
it was evident that one sentiment affected all the guests on entering the dining	75.32575938727942
each one asked what strange influence had brought them to this house and yet ast	118.00440005640144

de villefort had on the right hand madame danglars on his left morrel	40.283450738254224
the count was seated between madame de villefort and danglars the other seats we	35.71353732782506

gentlemen he said you will admit that when arrived at a certain degree of fortun	47.63316228493902

petersburg the other five leagues from naples	172.90971256599389
is it not amusing to see them both on the same table	45.706982742400335
what are the two fish asked danglars	26.371019808758444
chteaurenaud who has lived in russia will tell you the name of one and major cav	52.89035246516348
this one is i think a sterlet said chteaurenaud	67.27206055935702
and that one if i mistake not a lamprey	178.39207612065118
just so	77.51282163984807
now m	556.1776942795395
danglars ask these gentlemen where they are caught	229.69488528196146
sterlets said chteaurenaud are only found in the volga	42.67824429441874
and said cavalcanti i know that lake fusaro alone supplies lampreys of that size	91.10815258820574
exactly one comes from the volga and the other from lake fusaro	61.18923243093572
impossible cried all the guests simultaneously	262.11861007042876
well this is just what amuses me said monte cristo	32.301491055632326
i am like nerocupitor impossibilium and that is what is amusing you at this mome	56.547144765533346
this fish which seems so exquisite to you is very likely no better than perch or	203.3495916623977
but how could you have these fish brought to france	45.074383194194
oh nothing more easy	184.03826180290432
each fish was brought over in a caskone filled with river herbs and weeds the ot	62.42512736389037
you do not believe me m	17.1840724586424
i can not help doubting answered danglars with his stupid smile	49.70950276799851
baptistin said the count have the other fish brought inthe sterlet and the lampr	63.360063624388644

but why have two of each sort asked danglars	95.19053804458683
merely because one might have died carelessly answered monte cristo	132.86501990946826
you are certainly an extraordinary man said danglars and philosophers may well s	130.3898355173106
and to have ideas added madame danglars	196.21154753490805
oh do not give me credit for this madame it was done by the romans who much este	48.15083060423907

yes said debray but then ostia is only a few leagues from rome	23.405957397667045
true said monte cristo but what would be the use of living eighteen hundred year	39.83582093444368
the two cavalcanti opened their enormous eyes but had the good sense not to say 	133.03479291638067
all this is very extraordinary said chteaurenaud still what i admire the most i 	70.13369887205228
is it not true that you only bought this house five or six days ago	27.13954185891755
certainly not longer	960.058196629724
well i am sure it is quite transformed since last week	100.7770597133901
if i remember rightly it had another entrance and the courtyard was paved and em	101.19175377884046
why not i am fond of grass and shade said monte cristo	50.823933540714926

yes madame said monte cristo but i preferred having an entrance which would allo	51.0198968325178
in four days said morrel it is extraordinary	43.40001949785546
indeed said chteaurenaud it seems quite miraculous to make a new house out of an	56.60552450018401
i recollect coming for my mother to look at it when m	95.29231226670511
de saintmran advertised it for sale two or three years ago	52.02652144411992
de saintmran said madame de villefort then this house belonged to m	23.912384745045678
de saintmran before you bought it	87.07378537773066
it appears so replied monte cristo	32.22408601172503
is it possible that you do not know of whom you purchased it	27.608207138413125
quite so my steward transacts all this business for me	80.95305348355551
it is certainly ten years since the house had been occupied said chteaurenaud an	40.6759875488684
really if the house had not belonged to the fatherinlaw of the procureur one mig	59.38751588336863
villefort who had hitherto not tasted the three or four glasses of rare wine whi	56.719597897143835
monte cristo allowed a short time to elapse and then said	61.53376145330435
it is singular baron but the same idea came across me the first time i came here	59.42975329412411
perhaps the fellow had been bribed by the notary	57.7157483486038
it is probable stammered out villefort trying to smile but i can assure you that	57.427417758864685
this house is part of valentines marriageportion and m	49.817755095757214
de saintmran wished to sell it for if it had remained another year or two uninha	52.41184793277036
it was morrels turn to become pale	76.58705138432856
there was above all one room continued monte cristo very plain in appearance hun	129.9334653375996
why so said danglars why dramatic	44.72697051350056
can we account for instinct said monte cristo	135.75191523100682
are there not some places where we seem to breathe sadnesswhy we can not tell	91.81838812343807
it is a chain of recollectionsan idea which carries you back to other times to o	77.94041569981341

after dinner the play	651.0811946867314
monte cristo looked inquiringly at his guests	56.229409804209006
madame de villefort rose monte cristo did the same and the rest followed their e	64.62131387066036
villefort and madame danglars remained for a moment as if rooted to their seats 	54.6776649487208
did you hear said madame danglars	15.434557394324413
we must go replied villefort offering his arm	41.15199964815672
the others attracted by curiosity were already scattered in different parts of t	100.42744819789698
each one went out by the open doors	99.96830174902432
monte cristo waited for the two who remained then when they had passed he brough	61.99482269366245
they began by walking through the apartments many of which were fitted up in the	74.14461173384316
the drawingrooms were decorated with the rarest pictures by the old masters the 	121.52185554770652
at length they arrived at the famous room	43.83123241055362
there was nothing particular about it excepting that although daylight had disap	155.37961594146802
these two causes were enough to give it a gloomy aspect	86.77059553811117
cried madame de villefort it is really frightful	17.208938750718318
madame danglars tried to utter a few words but was not heard	41.09980668523029
many observations were made the import of which was a unanimous opinion that the	61.86146688835824

is it not so asked monte cristo	10.887477727792483

villefort became livid madame danglars fell into a long seat placed near the chi	106.52566931225451
oh said madame de villefort smiling are you courageous enough to sit down upon t	37.72961168302278
madame danglars rose suddenly	178.14887403034575
and then said monte cristo this is not all	23.457096302153793
what is there more said debray who had not failed to notice the agitation of mad	44.4730651338844

look at it and tell me what you think of it	19.236903692746633
what a wickedlooking crooked staircase said chteaurenaud with a smile	54.219367441706844
i do not know whether the wine of chios produces melancholy but certainly everyt	85.37175304567958
ever since valentines dowry had been mentioned morrel had been silent and sad	108.4690399880635
can you imagine said monte cristo some othello or abb de ganges one stormy dark 	112.08663921726856
madame danglars half fainted on the arm of villefort who was obliged to support 	43.43124874649812
ah madame cried debray what is the matter with you how pale you look	44.84214832994113
it is very evident what is the matter with her said madame de villefort m	23.935662488546775
de monte cristo is relating horrible stories to us doubtless intending to fright	291.96942667769065
yes said villefort really count you frighten the ladies	151.9991243043475
what is the matter asked debray in a whisper of madame danglars	8.88836966378169
nothing she replied with a violent effort	63.74358826548272
i want air that is all	253.6699739979499
will you come into the garden said debray advancing towards the back staircase	52.172735052290136
no no she answered i would rather remain here	107.34104321693643

why should we not imagine this the apartment of an honest mother and this bed wi	111.6989647492672
here madame danglars instead of being calmed by the soft picture uttered a groan	120.20675043413952

i think so	37.05212364062499
madame danglars was carried into the adjoining room monte cristo dropped a very 	61.06899435975251
ah she cried what a frightful dream	133.73716353807947
villefort pressed her hand to let her know it was not a dream	32.6125784889842
they looked for m	242.78853493293272
danglars but as he was not especially interested in poetical ideas he had gone i	91.80761827997335
monte cristo seemed in despair	81.6097654003022
he took the arm of madame danglars and conducted her into the garden where they 	35.03257935276996
really madame he said did i alarm you much	79.03438891369795
oh no sir she answered but you know things impress us differently according to t	120.7815400264287
villefort forced a laugh	250.27495152758334
and then you know he said an idea a supposition is sufficient	76.7320615551867
well said monte cristo you may believe me if you like but it is my opinion that 	22.125645924513538
take care said madame de villefort the kings attorney is here	14.0158046234331
ah replied monte cristo since that is the case i will take advantage of his pres	18.676492435926516
your declaration said villefort	34.40708855054096
yes before witnesses	8886.952916332692
oh this is very interesting said debray if there really has been a crime we will	36.534240336329056
there has been a crime said monte cristo	19.751678175198254
come this way gentlemen come m	381.7418469934616
villefort for a declaration to be available should be made before the competent 	130.77476670059843
he then took villeforts arm and at the same time holding that of madame danglars	29.134643856322466
all the other guests followed	100.95073307607194

this house was gloomy because it was remorseful it was remorseful because it con	73.10113484157647
who said it was a crime asked villefort with a last effort	52.429182692977626
how is it not a crime to bury a living child in a garden cried monte cristo	60.68723592324284
and pray what do you call such an action	69.16840147349869
but who said it was buried alive	218.4961383806688
why bury it there if it were dead this garden has never been a cemetery	156.8245431246222
what is done to infanticides in this country asked major cavalcanti innocently	126.03483562826342
oh their heads are soon cut off said danglars	195.5717937832245
ah indeed said cavalcanti	7.609331436373738
i think so am i not right m	98.81470798911623
de villefort asked monte cristo	11.88180512906624
yes count replied villefort in a voice now scarcely human	64.9691489170625
monte cristo seeing that the two persons for whom he had prepared this scene cou	72.0487028986236
come gentlemensome coffee we seem to have forgotten it and he conducted the gues	147.51570303207058
indeed count said madame danglars i am ashamed to own it but all your frightful 	68.12033723792165
monte cristo bowed and went to madame de villefort	10.613915549846055
i think madame danglars again requires your bottle he said	193.20770692910003
but before madame de villefort could reach her friend the procureur had found ti	98.45345257047398
in my office or in the court if you likethat is the surest place	78.29603771595438
i will be there	30.813312047980233
at this moment madame de villefort approached	9.338609112285495
thanks my dear friend said madame danglars trying to smile it is over now and i 	21.51244082050825

the evening passed on madame de villefort expressed a desire to return to paris 	34.64151321583193
on his wifes request m	105.26347407354667
de villefort was the first to give the signal of departure	32.02552317327896
he offered a seat in his landau to madame danglars that she might be under the c	40.388948063958416
as for m	28.05779984338951
danglars absorbed in an interesting conversation with m	351.8035320399183
cavalcanti he paid no attention to anything that was passing	109.4039397525592
while monte cristo had begged the smellingbottle of madame de villefort he had n	21.078539626076562
without opposing their arrangements he allowed morrel chteaurenaud and debray to	88.15401413917364
de villeforts carriage	47.53958483260577
danglars more and more delighted with major cavalcanti had offered him a seat in	107.07792116957654
andrea cavalcanti found his tilbury waiting at the door the groom in every respe	54.15699225301859
andrea had spoken very little during dinner he was an intelligent lad and he fea	73.66955601043911
then he had been seized upon by danglars who with a rapid glance at the stiffnec	30.21908656119921
he contemplated with unspeakable delight the large diamond which shone on the ma	115.21933998285054
then after dinner on the pretext of business he questioned the father and son up	121.21957944667957
one thing above all the rest heightened the respect nay almost the veneration of	170.9255700709113
the latter faithful to the principle of horace nil admirari had contented himsel	73.37170900674462
then he had eaten some without saying a word more danglars therefore concluded t	164.98916146141258
thus it was with much politeness of manner that he heard cavalcanti pronounce th	102.17305327102169
tomorrow sir i shall have the honor of waiting upon you on business	33.943885947121
and i sir said danglars shall be most happy to receive you	41.49230443020503
upon which he offered to take cavalcanti in his carriage to the htel des princes	24.90660900537297
to this cavalcanti replied by saying that for some time past his son had lived i	123.89419894408279
the major seated himself therefore by the side of danglars who was more and more	60.09145392360636
as for andrea he began by way of showing off to scold his groom who instead of b	101.99863887592447
the groom heard him with humility took the bit of the impatient animal with his 	127.66657442552766
at that moment a hand touched his shoulder	47.36508532292726
the young man turned round thinking that danglars or monte cristo had forgotten 	56.51274944736732
but instead of either of these he saw nothing but a strange face sunburnt and en	134.99730845250565
a red handkerchief encircled his gray head torn and filthy garments covered his 	159.8372778571959
30229 m	1.1558407562187403
did the young man recognize that face by the light of the lantern in his tilbury	63.137668367714426
what do you want of me he asked	12.25409113987683
pardon me my friend if i disturb you said the man with the red handkerchief but 	24.54207881063517
you have no right to beg at night said the groom endeavoring to rid his master o	52.340819094763205
i am not begging my fine fellow said the unknown to the servant with so ironical	61.44049662558836
come said andrea with sufficient nerve for his servant not to perceive his agita	60.31166000718188
the man said in a low voice i wishi wish you to spare me the walk back to paris	36.84096983269916
i am very tired and as i have not eaten so good a dinner as you i can scarcely s	57.897728372690494
the young man shuddered at this strange familiarity	40.42644337675862
tell me he saidtell me what you want	47.336433078553796
well then i want you to take me up in your fine carriage and carry me back	44.55993710263572
andrea turned pale but said nothing	58.83172687216451
yes said the man thrusting his hands into his pockets and looking impudently at 	33.0705263997802
at this name no doubt the young man reflected a little for he went towards his g	50.190970607132954
this man is right i did indeed charge him with a commission the result of which 	75.46643819786756
the surprised groom retired	8931.031511800034
let me at least reach a shady spot said andrea	56.50595911587879
oh as for that ill take you to a splendid place said the man with the handkerchi	66.50169779098061
do nt think i want the glory of riding in your fine carriage said he oh no its o	65.28454186383998
come step in said the young man	75.02268303448874
it was a pity this scene had not occurred in daylight for it was curious to see 	57.54685180854701
andrea drove past the last house in the village without saying a word to his com	101.81214176989806
once out of auteuil andrea looked around in order to assure himself that he coul	23.57630260586869
now tell me why you come to disturb my tranquillity	64.56199365142976
let me ask you why you deceived me	61.84052696249802
how have i deceived you	79.24031212675972
how do you ask when we parted at the pont du var you told me you were going to t	21.583692179969848
how does that annoy you	43.79176940566896
it does not on the contrary i think it will answer my purpose	38.73944936265789
so said andrea you are speculating upon me	32.855544215694486
what fine words he uses	397.0009580864384
i warn you master caderousse that you are mistaken	55.26233849587558
well well do nt be angry my boy you know well enough what it is to be unfortunat	30.825899114541663
i thought you were earning a living in tuscany or piedmont by acting as facchino	61.97933443673154
you know i always did call you my child	137.209477248653
come come what then	44.50232900025704
i am patient but go on	121.75688026953439
all at once i see you pass through the barrier with a groom a tilbury and fine n	72.4637400780679
you must have discovered a mine or else become a stockbroker	158.58040762990828
so that as you confess you are jealous	83.74407060187849
no i am pleasedso pleased that i wished to congratulate you but as i am not quit	32.98950875050151
yes and a fine opportunity you have chosen exclaimed andrea you speak to me befo	46.514822829951726
how can i help that my boy i speak to you when i can catch you	45.05032804420119
you have a quick horse a light tilbury you are naturally as slippery as an eel i	78.79668127102134
you see i do not conceal myself	36.440575283878445
you are lucky i wish i could say as much for i do conceal myself and then i was 	64.75941480523706
it was very polite of you	66.67096140751656
come said andrea what do you want	8.44903334845504
you do not speak affectionately to me benedetto my old friend that is not rightt	40.20572120562877
this menace smothered the young mans passion	136.71965431330165
he urged the horse again into a trot	155.99965593890965
you should not speak so to an old friend like me caderousse as you said just now	77.73016072563817
do you know then now what you are	19.470726346759474
no but i was brought up in corsica you are old and obstinate i am young and wilf	41.294550542459355
between people like us threats are out of place everything should be amicably ar	531.4066127501648
is it my fault if fortune which has frowned on you has been kind to me	98.59688389328151
fortune has been kind to you then your tilbury your groom your clothes are not t	123.41129893173408
oh you knew that well enough before speaking to me said andrea becoming more and	72.07722360609675
if i had been wearing a handkerchief like yours on my head rags on my back and w	74.27206953244283
you wrong me my boy now i have found you nothing prevents my being as welldresse	108.8244343287342
if you have two coats you will give me one of them	23.92848452809189
i used to divide my soup and beans with you when you were hungry	99.00260661171292
true said andrea	3.771586794747713
what an appetite you used to have is it as good now	186.04638371867543
oh yes replied andrea laughing	15.784631541260463
how did you come to be dining with that prince whose house you have just left	63.02682374752872
he is not a prince simply a count	88.18920454789982
a count and a rich one too eh	358.02654372784144
yes but you had better not have anything to say to him for he is not a very good	33.30688878416249
oh be easy i have no design upon your count and you shall have him all to yourse	47.15287511169049
but said caderousse again smiling with the disagreeable expression he had before	64.6750138862057
well what do you want	9.096854164358398
i think that with a hundred francs a month	49.93109996503919
i could live	390.220327202311
upon a hundred francs	30.276029178234918
comeyou understand me but that with	326.6030121651605
with a hundred and fifty francs i should be quite happy	47.84429432654235

30233 m	1.0585861218271746
good said caderousse	4.63358247363921

there now again you degrade me	337.1884572847182
how so	22.426880196184243
by making me apply to the servants when i want to transact business with you alo	129.59592851498655
well be it so then	51.33474655341653
take it from me then and so long at least as i receive my income you shall be pa	39.735093484921755
come come i always said you were a fine fellow and it is a blessing when good fo	54.96330092639842
but tell me all about it	35.90690144212154
why do you wish to know asked cavalcanti	8.473313566066333
what do you again defy me	60.331276725981205
no the fact is i have found my father	61.19848233402015

yes so long as he pays me	57.54125422343825

what is his name	10.752989626759005
major cavalcanti	10.412816121781468
is he pleased with you	71.86160571379239
so far i have appeared to answer his purpose	110.9920249168531
and who found this father for you	114.80145027019304
the count of monte cristo	4.695409463011269
the man whose house you have just left	120.42975616605207
i wish you would try and find me a situation with him as grandfather since he ho	165.7408580114546
well i will mention you to him	32.40325394608825
meanwhile what are you going to do	7.21309516251429
yes you	46.97435176384426
it is very kind of you to trouble yourself about me	47.612123095726716
since you interest yourself in my affairs i think it is now my turn to ask you s	53.62644442887784
ah true	20.417175754524205
well i shall rent a room in some respectable house wear a decent coat shave ever	242.4175423709542
then in the evening i shall go to the theatre i shall look like some retired bak	53.058990030103985
that is what i want	11.142393466852425
come if you will only put this scheme into execution and be steady nothing could	280.7442238244357
do you think so m	17.802781610595524
bossuet and youwhat will you become a peer of france	52.17749938741733
ah said andrea who knows	17.980819233128233
major cavalcanti is already one perhaps but then hereditary rank is abolished	404.8588988703926
no politics caderousse	1904.8314747887064
and now that you have all you want and that we understand each other jump down f	62.14307289760777
not at all my good friend	24.795717282303503
how not at all	82.4690158227207
why just think for a moment with this red handkerchief on my head with scarcely 	148.98316215888826
then to justify myself i should say that you gave me the money this would cause 	112.53118260385361
then i should become simply no	489.706236796139
106 and goodbye to my dream of resembling the retired baker no no my boy i prefe	148.364124350789
andrea scowled	10735.753265965011
certainly as he had himself owned the reputed son of major cavalcanti was a wilf	60.59597650423498
he drew up for a minute threw a rapid glance around him and then his hand fell i	60.82774729436267
but meanwhile caderousse who had never taken his eyes off his companion passed h	96.04679766822986
the two friends as we see were worthy of and understood one another	162.71520078116038
andreas hand left his pocket inoffensively and was carried up to the red moustac	75.83929932986447
good caderousse he said how happy you will be	34.331177143724126
i will do my best said the innkeeper of the pont du gard shutting up his knife	34.54184467705652
well then we will go into paris	14.450271253691815
but how will you pass through the barrier without exciting suspicion it seems to	64.9813870527714
wait said caderousse we shall see	8.528638675098266
he then took the greatcoat with the large collar which the groom had left behind	59.876420032285054
but tell me said andrea am i to remain bareheaded	31.33610079631531
pooh said caderousse it is so windy that your hat can easily appear to have blow	53.28656128838179
come come enough of this said cavalcanti	36.15633732521609
what are you waiting for said caderousse	28.342623118798368
i hope i am not the cause	29.242760759765623
hush said andrea	3.4305856316282726
they passed the barrier without accident	111.28896086200196
at the first cross street andrea stopped his horse and caderousse leaped out	47.18785107492514
well said andreamy servants coat and my hat	241.81916000503188
ah said caderousse you would not like me to risk taking cold	79.07148116387869
but what am i to do	19.6831424097335
you oh you are young while i am beginning to get old	142.17387783572488
au revoir benedetto and running into a court he disappeared	78.71004759190724
alas said andrea sighing one can not be completely happy in this world	51.22963427813686

most probably morrel and chteaurenaud returned to their domestic hearths as they	51.97032408040033
when he reached the wicket of the louvre he turned to the left galloped across t	45.98552633643562
danglars door just at the same time that villeforts landau after having deposite	78.0964411952735
debray with the air of a man familiar with the house entered first into the cour	47.35879569756261
the gate once closed and debray and the baroness alone in the court he asked	64.02182452007023
what was the matter with you hermine and why were you so affected at that story 	51.46610586086006
because i have been in such shocking spirits all the evening my friend said the 	47.934802868301595
no hermine replied debray you can not make me believe that on the contrary you w	19.042678396865302
danglars was disagreeable certainly but i know how much you care for his illhumo	111.2968150124917
someone has vexed you i will allow no one to annoy you	86.57527535170463
you are deceived lucien i assure you replied madame danglars and what i have tol	26.745901446756648
it was evident that madame danglars was suffering from that nervous irritability	54.07084719398401
being a man who knew that the former of these symptoms was one of the inherent p	25.134891798973026
at the door of her apartment the baroness met mademoiselle cornlie her confident	50.377970946459286
what is my daughter doing asked madame danglars	46.2258207314164
she practiced all the evening and then went to bed replied mademoiselle cornlie	99.834347470692
yet i think i hear her piano	96.33695754043639
it is mademoiselle louise darmilly who is playing while mademoiselle danglars is	48.5135591258335
well said madame danglars come and undress me	50.070541269175926
they entered the bedroom	110.77730396120681
debray stretched himself upon a large couch and madame danglars passed into her 	119.87704572114878
my dear m	8.397679659735077
lucien said madame danglars through the door you are always complaining that eug	39.869466135739536
madame said lucien playing with a little dog who recognizing him as a friend of 	52.70819953443729
true said madame danglars yet i think this will all pass off and that you will o	47.92924891595157
my study	4085.392758193331
at least that of the minister	56.53393405682676
why so	26.093147584803713
to ask for an engagement at the opera	56.72314103536064
really i never saw such an infatuation for music it is quite ridiculous for a yo	77.17091257355757
debray smiled	116.88838457683121
well said he let her come with your consent and that of the baron and we will tr	49.37550027095187
go cornlie said madame danglars i do not require you any longer	21.328883138085036
cornlie obeyed and the next minute madame danglars left her room in a charming l	43.59319898726061
then she began thoughtfully to caress the little spaniel	76.42314467943658
lucien looked at her for a moment in silence	19.87457734802108
come hermine he said after a short time answer candidlysomething vexes youis it 	100.97538225995049
30239 m	1.0502616179436368
nothing answered the baroness	30.36413459405519
and yet as she could scarcely breathe she rose and went towards a lookingglass	108.03941031252614
i am frightful tonight she said	144.09658154209058
debray rose smiling and was about to contradict the baroness upon this latter po	117.80251139689362
danglars appeared debray reseated himself	136.71443897186236
at the noise of the door madame danglars turned round and looked upon her husban	22.16905558491594
goodevening madame said the banker goodevening m	61.58163619090956
probably the baroness thought this unexpected visit signified a desire to make u	187.4316364126145
assuming a dignified air she turned round to debray without answering her husban	71.40928113735067
read me something m	177.32458264783153
debray she said	94.2458713976175
debray who was slightly disturbed at this visit recovered himself when he saw th	94.52833686670796
excuse me said the banker but you will tire yourself baroness by such late hours	92.36690623522622
debray lives some distance from here	1471.5536972790183
debray was petrified not only to hear danglars speak so calmly and politely but 	172.71219335463
the baroness was also surprised and showed her astonishment by a look which woul	59.42941323532095
the result was that the proud look entirely failed of its purpose	299.4987639576166
lucien said the baroness i assure you i have no desire to sleep and that i have 	19.84188041006523
i am at your service madame replied lucien coldly	14.247016927606246
my dear m	9.552168785076065
debray said the banker do not kill yourself tonight listening to the follies of 	58.42691634617353
this time the blow was so well aimed and hit so directly that lucien and the bar	105.40375801392163
do not think i wish to turn you out my dear debray continued danglars oh no not 	31.817819758737905
an unexpected occurrence forces me to ask my wife to have a little conversation 	112.55248726290318
debray muttered something bowed and went out knocking himself against the edge o	203.41282243724302
it is extraordinary he said when the door was closed behind him how easily these	85.56403159577806
30241 m	1.0209342244674826
lucien having left danglars took his place on the sofa closed the open book and 	53.68049055452454
the animal uttered a cry during the transit but arrived at its destination it cr	80.4854789329202
do you know sir asked the baroness that you are improving generally you are only	29.309601071452803
it is because i am in a worse humor than usual replied danglars	56.08874118822872
hermine looked at the banker with supreme disdain	31.831879646991176
these glances frequently exasperated the pride of danglars but this evening he t	105.75475684702351
and what have i to do with your illhumor said the baroness irritated at the impa	23.375680922835652
not so replied danglars your advice is wrong so i shall not follow it	56.27833666230476
my money boxes are my pactolus as i think m	161.75686579333515
demoustier says and i will not retard its course or disturb its calm	251.05031125033992
my clerks are honest men who earn my fortune whom i pay much below their deserts	271.5947292987974
and pray who are the persons who exhaust your fortune explain yourself more clea	142.23476969324847
oh make yourself easyi am not speaking riddles and you will soon know what i mea	100.83825133972188
the people who exhaust my fortune are those who draw out 700000 francs in the co	100.56939130446152
i do not understand you sir said the baroness trying to disguise the agitation o	22.955784572258185
you understand me perfectly on the contrary said danglars but if you will persis	20.550158077948804
and pray asked the baroness am i responsible for this loss	99.00968808320178
why not	65.38538779163093
is it my fault you have lost 700000 francs	31.475942326541684
certainly it is not mine	30.513479743123717
once for all sir replied the baroness sharply i tell you i will not hear cash na	57.75327168233501
oh i can well believe that for neither of them was worth a penny	95.44160505108012
the better reason for my not being conversant with the slang of the bank which i	83.86267352945609
i only know one thing i dislike more which is the sound of your voice	106.99926856486852
really said danglars	5.2583571511807135
well this surprises me for i thought you took the liveliest interest in all my a	129.51135718645892
30243 m	1.103872652764351
i what could put such an idea into your head	281.5970590404523
ahwhat next	4475.7930259642335
most assuredly	65.82340532598927
i should like to know upon what occasion	137.9822394327249
oh mon dieu that is very easily done	72.61828926236592
last february you were the first who told me of the haitian funds	37.124464424050096
you had dreamed that a ship had entered the harbor at le havre that this ship br	80.13481343979544
i know how clearsighted your dreams are i therefore purchased immediately as man	373.9870005109548
you spent it as you pleased that was your business	186.22149846414266
in march there was a question about a grant to a railway	137.67308632681903
three companies presented themselves each offering equal securities	807.4741769628039
you told me that your instinctand although you pretend to know nothing about spe	67.11346260583898
i bought two thirds of the shares of that company as you had foreseen the shares	65.1739370436259
how have you spent this 250000 francsit is no business of mine	82.05729921896133
when are you coming to the point cried the baroness shivering with anger and imp	34.54325296216111
patience madame i am coming to it	37.05909425490893
that s fortunate	312.4885633084361
in april you went to dine at the ministers	51.497601535105126
you heard a private conversation respecting spanish affairson the expulsion of d	214.98541374942556
i bought some spanish shares	250.8133970760998
the expulsion took place and i pocketed 600000 francs the day charles v	66.75863552847491
repassed the bidassoa	7.955424074726647
of these 600000 francs you took 50000 crowns	256.21041747742817
they were yours you disposed of them according to your fancy and i asked no ques	112.10149848884045
well sir and what then	110.25438208225998
ah yes it was just after this that you spoiled everything	135.5181768395779
really your manner of speaking	425.13217141960416
it expresses my meaning and that is all i want	52.15620630736524
well three days after that you talked politics with m	174.19499340158015
debray and you fancied from his words that don carlos had returned to spain	72.69828726472943
well i sold my shares the news got out and i no longer soldi gave them away next	154.10407314829615
well since i gave you a fourth of my gains i think you owe me a fourth of my los	36.96625164552107
what you say is absurd and i can not see why m	71.08432876955358
debrays name is mixed up in this affair	96.67975099323125
because if you do not possess the 175000 francs i reclaim you must have lent the	50.18314515247185
debray is one of your friends	30.756136189494796

for shame exclaimed the baroness	160.59536482012922
oh let us have no gestures no screams no modern drama or you will oblige me to t	50.499223991865094
the baroness became enraged	540.1458106178281
wretch she cried will you dare to tell me you did not know what you now reproach	62.64441534936171
i do not say that i did know it and i do not say that i did not know it	12.181625536320485
i merely tell you to look into my conduct during the last four years that we hav	81.51117656708053
some time after our rupture you wished to study music under the celebrated barit	98.32682610304764
this cost me on your account and mine 100000 francs	138.99092798466347
i said nothing for we must have peace in the house and 100000 francs for a lady 	41.97424665528378
well you soon become tired of singing and you take a fancy to study diplomacy wi	201.22416140406406
you understand it signifies nothing to me so long as you pay for your lessons ou	43.5461006431669
but today i find you are drawing on mine and that your apprenticeship may cost m	124.52390428172632
stop there madame for this can not last	249.72599193393518
either the diplomatist must give his lessons gratis and i will tolerate him or h	111.11207104047799
oh this is too much cried hermine choking you are worse than despicable	70.81935313951176
but continued danglars i find you did not even pause there	110.72840090616486
you are right let us leave these facts alone and reason coolly	168.96741841863056
i have never interfered in your affairs excepting for your good treat me in the 	87.94576635739497
you say you have nothing to do with my cash box	70.7660177409785
be it so	10.730598433559951
do as you like with your own but do not fill or empty mine	170.50520292040304
besides how do i know that this was not a political trick that the minister enra	49.91835187115573
debray to ruin me	159.65233163365195
a probable thing	632.2784313460368
why not who ever heard of such an occurrence as thisa false telegraphic despatch	292.14810298899
it was done on purpose for mei am sure of it	67.72801314946831
sir said the baroness humbly are you not aware that the man employed there was d	52.30404385824177
yes which made fools laugh which caused the minister to have a sleepless night w	308.3683804765361

still it seems to me that as you profit by it	39.599304308556874
danglars shrugged his shoulders	21.738090364852066
foolish creature he exclaimed	154.6264622069757

at this time that is about halfpast twelve madame danglars ordered her carriage 	127.43363148265365

have you had another fall at the bourse	78.77534259146765
no i am safe for a few days at least	24.38010784649228
i am only annoyed about a bankrupt of trieste	95.71213571543336
really does it happen to be jacopo manfredi	27.36610465003962
exactly so	111.49744274097193

it is an unheardof fatality	45.181966336897766

today is the 30th	31.669277951444663
i present them but my correspondent has disappeared	171.5590464772801
this with my spanish affairs made a pretty end to the month	181.22666055340312
then you really lost by that affair in spain	96.64149515097345
yes only 700000 francs out of my cash boxnothing more	233.3687987456421
why how could you make such a mistakesuch an old stager	92.45521254250542
oh it is all my wifes fault	38.04585101283741
she dreamed don carlos had returned to spain she believes in dreams	104.54032156437478
it is magnetism she says and when she dreams a thing it is sure to happen she as	133.3744176257691
on this conviction i allow her to speculate she having her bank and her stockbro	147.1412617000564
it is true she speculates with her own money not mine nevertheless you can under	126.43029923305356
but do you mean to say you have not heard of this why the thing has made a treme	28.76841839815101

30251 m	2.0533527767223356
then you do not speculate	33.437925893138285
ihow could i speculate when i already have so much trouble in regulating my inco	140.52916116155845
but touching these spanish affairs i think that the baroness did not dream the w	96.19438269763333
the papers said something about it did they not	210.28605711144385
then you believe the papers	55.06918046155245
inot the least in the world only i fancied that the honest messager was an excep	54.67146008332962
well that s what puzzles me replied danglars the news of the return of don carlo	38.74617390308175
so that said monte cristo you have lost nearly 1700000 francs this month	45.23350847043096
not nearly indeed that is exactly my loss	200.7387552000915
diable said monte cristo compassionately it is a hard blow for a thirdrate fortu	29.045431233758507
thirdrate said danglars rather humble what do you mean by that	62.03755368711914
certainly continued monte cristo i make three assortments in fortunefirstrate se	58.71752126488336
i call those firstrate which are composed of treasures one possesses under ones 	857.4828172050461
i think this is about your position is it not	55.993609058783264
confound it yes replied danglars	40.03524567974643
the result then of six more such months as this would be to reduce the thirdrate	216.4567723119947
oh said danglars becoming very pale how you are running on	42.107908234296325
let us imagine seven such months continued monte cristo in the same tone	69.80310024051629
tell me have you ever thought that seven times 1700000 francs make nearly twelve	99.40165639584811

so much the better	5.103874694199555
i congratulate you my dear m	23.18765474978766
danglars said monte cristo i see i was deceived and that you belong to the class	41.53470570589954
i think i may aspire to that honor said danglars with a smile which reminded mon	63.18450115918939
but while we are speaking of business danglars added pleased to find an opportun	110.29234660188878
give him money if he is recommended to you and the recommendation seems good	88.53061014868746
excellent he presented himself this morning with a bond of 40000 francs payable 	58.687514332762994
monte cristo nodded his head in token of assent	25.89907807897022
but that is not all continued danglars he has opened an account with my house fo	58.05037946368182
may i ask how much he allows the young man	47.776698797609164
five thousand francs per month	6.499503553844778
sixty thousand francs per year	9.561547224118675
i thought i was right in believing that cavalcanti to be a stingy fellow	52.2269348100334
how can a young man live upon 5000 francs a month	40.13737515854229
but you understand that if the young man should want a few thousands more	62.88686980103761
do not advance it the father will never repay it	149.65115916859963
you do not know these ultramontane millionaires they are regular misers	62.274155319879696
and by whom were they recommended to you	99.60577361378981
oh by the house of fenzi one of the best in florence	40.609582027906406
i do not mean to say you will lose but nevertheless mind you hold to the terms o	70.14359850735659
would you not trust the cavalcanti	21.429716201710185
i oh i would advance ten millions on his signature	309.8098047735906
i was only speaking in reference to the secondrate fortunes we were mentioning j	123.98314227831159
and with all this how unassuming he is i should never have taken him for anythin	59.75500041606773
and you would have flattered him for certainly as you say he has no manner	77.32506579060797
the first time i saw him he appeared to me like an old lieutenant who had grown 	49.77107473469906
but all the italians are the same they are like old jews when they are not glitt	56.47096951436242
the young man is better said danglars	22.45837999726916
yes a little nervous perhaps but upon the whole he appeared tolerable	280.43488859825453
i was uneasy about him	146.5456688183012
because you met him at my house just after his introduction into the world as th	128.21612634752506
he has been travelling with a very severe tutor and had never been to paris befo	35.951102727334664
ah i believe noblemen marry amongst themselves do they not asked danglars carele	300.2066621418166
it is usual certainly but cavalcanti is an original who does nothing like other 	208.84260200075474
i can not help thinking that he has brought his son to france to choose a wife	45.54340115614505
do you think so	7.730528430803613
i am sure of it	7.804486070984804
and you have heard his fortune mentioned	63.26725863959377
nothing else was talked of only some said he was worth millions and others that 	279.9400202904375
and what is your opinion	12.87304368888164
i ought not to influence you because it is only my own personal impression	93.71492428838576
well and it is that	32.54892092889179
my opinion is that all these old podests these ancient condottierifor the cavalc	91.72006171282794
certainly said danglars and this is further supported by the fact of their not p	59.733833566282826
very little at least i know of none which cavalcanti possesses excepting his pal	113.71767846259287
ah he has a palace said danglars laughing come that is something	100.67835660379063
yes and more than that he lets it to the minister of finance while he lives in a	74.53467958968302
oh as i told you before i think the old fellow is very close	73.56379019189067
come you do not flatter him	33.369283856437235
i scarcely know him i think i have seen him three times in my life all i know re	60.87260544885511
he was telling me this morning that tired of letting his property lie dormant in	131.9410475247098
never mind accept my thanks for the client you have sent me	66.98062513094672
it is a fine name to inscribe on my ledgers and my cashier was quite proud of it	51.31004164130674
by the way this is merely a simple question when this sort of people marry their	123.92149568996909
oh that depends upon circumstances	364.91741865664403
i know an italian prince rich as a gold mine one of the noblest families in tusc	90.47529999511224
should andrea marry according to his fathers views he will perhaps give him one 	136.36559396192447
for example supposing it were the daughter of a banker he might take an interest	140.60872398312733
ah that boy will find out some bavarian or peruvian princess he will want a crow	143.08515483822433
no these grand lords on the other side of the alps frequently marry into plain f	119.57521175423508
but do you wish to marry andrea my dear m	24.596045972004717
danglars that you are asking so many questions	126.83885751307824
ma foi said danglars it would not be a bad speculation i fancy and you know i am	19.55702954410967
you are not thinking of mademoiselle danglars i hope you would not like poor and	36.42184853180139
albert repeated danglars shrugging his shoulders ah well he would care very litt	127.84085999388401
but he is betrothed to your daughter i believe	59.7680233208528
well m	195.05769810720372
de morcerf and i have talked about this marriage but madame de morcerf and alber	22.885262949174166
you do not mean to say that it would not be a good match	16.567803465850034
indeed i imagine that mademoiselle danglars is as good as m	36.978768850771544
de morcerf	1.0574916614103216
mademoiselle danglars fortune will be great no doubt especially if the telegraph	162.29529061896764
oh i do not mean her fortune only but tell me	50.08427156078484
why did you not invite m	28.875788977227874
and madame de morcerf to your dinner	42.54988314702149
i did so but he excused himself on account of madame de morcerf being obliged to	52.55939507183665
yes yes said danglars laughing it would do her a great deal of good	38.07486153594639
why so	38.88718635823497
because it is the air she always breathed in her youth	123.4014718584699
monte cristo took no notice of this illnatured remark	51.30523419251748
but still if albert be not so rich as mademoiselle danglars said the count you m	41.88686270652515
so he has but i like mine as well	177.53347175914337
certainly your name is popular and does honor to the title they have adorned it 	181.0571924205043
and for this very reason said danglars with a smile which he tried to make sardo	28.490515090110616
andrea cavalcanti to m	127.5046248764874
albert de morcerf	17.216653989440637
still i should not think the morcerfs would yield to the cavalcanti	41.700399607392114
the morcerfsstay my dear count said danglars you are a man of the world are you 	16.33114290502078
i think so	39.22101963040138
and you understand heraldry	172.19618439208998
a little	54.0547996650792
well look at my coatofarms it is worth more than morcerfs	42.15572246510559
why so	36.16795079139019
because though i am not a baron by birth my real name is at least danglars	55.98824264943951
well what then	69.5418725761166
while his name is not morcerf	31.68992786887784
hownot morcerf	14.548298161214873
not the least in the world	25.622293208197195
go on	7.615053778426405
i have been made a baron so that i actually am one he made himself a count so th	96.55186067444049
listen my dear count m	32.422859564202874
de morcerf has been my friend or rather my acquaintance during the last thirty y	45.84920750190859
you know i have made the most of my arms though i never forgot my origin	77.99592263095023
a proof of great humility or great pride said monte cristo	109.40826977093366
well when i was a clerk morcerf was a mere fisherman	54.91077790677935
and then he was called	23.279329983575273
only fernand	25.431810600523853
fernand mondego	14.45448536371968
you are sure	19.823779655304662
pardieu i have bought enough fish of him to know his name	115.4031537534557
then why did you think of giving your daughter to him	59.13943025566482
because fernand and danglars being both parvenus both having become noble both r	229.36446099057585
oh nothing	432.4425238651887
ah yes what you tell me recalls to mind something about the name of fernand mond	57.22527319065016
i have heard that name in greece	42.45158330294345
in conjunction with the affairs of ali pasha	51.78031409635169
exactly so	116.54249361466772
this is the mystery said danglars	22.11234595720499
i acknowledge i would have given anything to find it out	56.81393160764068
it would be very easy if you much wished it	78.44495698263863
how so	19.208497960104996
probably you have some correspondent in greece	42.57910986619173
i should think so	85.88368405370252
at yanina	20.506862424041124
well write to your correspondent in yanina and ask him what part was played by a	157.69145937495765
you are right exclaimed danglars rising quickly i will write today	49.78634906906182
do so	86.328470631745
i will	11.739360823965198
30259 m	1.2474614445035233
and if you should hear of anything very scandalous	103.35678468328828
i will communicate it to you	31.440736144786612
you will oblige me	26.32258893571949
danglars rushed out of the room and made but one leap into his coup	54.3096205618652

she directed her course towards the faubourg saint germain went down the rue maz	49.32889324465402
she descended and went through the passage	84.81347920303998
she was very plainly dressed as would be the case with a woman of taste walking 	122.92875705795626
at the rue gungaud she called a cab and directed the driver to go to the rue de 	28.103821173323905
as soon as she was seated in the vehicle she drew from her pocket a very thick b	27.85275028536799
she then replaced the bonnet and saw with pleasure in a little pocketmirror that	77.67417624215767
the cab crossed the pontneuf and entered the rue de harlay by the place dauphine	34.51003767706966
there was a great deal going on that morning and many businesslike persons at th	56.55596260897925
there was a great press of people in m	37.249271555175724
de villeforts antechamber but madame danglars had no occasion even to pronounce 	88.84376242956218
the instant she appeared the doorkeeper rose came to her and asked her whether s	228.1669397218696

the magistrate was seated in an armchair writing with his back towards the door 	52.11302497277923
then when he had assured himself that he could neither be seen nor heard and was	80.9305519811899

it is true then he said rather uttering his thoughts aloud than addressing his c	98.16468788522576
sir said madame danglars you can feel for my emotion can you not spare me then i	41.49738950542008
when i look at this roomwhence so many guilty creatures have departed trembling 	232.74580220154175
villefort dropped his head and sighed	63.02048277137319
and i he said i feel that my place is not in the judges seat but on the prisoner	70.2493709309782

you said madame danglars	23.232239617015534
yes i	14.791362535021259
i think sir you exaggerate your situation said madame danglars whose beautiful e	132.88814648910832
the paths of which you were just speaking have been traced by all young men of a	74.59967668717837
besides the pleasure there is always remorse from the indulgence of our passions	132.2688605912636
madame replied villefort you know that i am no hypocrite or at least that i neve	22.674530377804167

well picture to yourself a future more gloomy stillcertainly frightful perhaps s	784.6796722935981

chance replied villefort no no madame there is no such thing as chance	66.96733988665717

you must not weep no you must not groan you must tremble	290.2787574498994
what can you mean asked madame danglars shuddering	20.632487834196343

never shall i forget your sublime courage when having returned to consciousness 	253.3855164469825
we were obliged to keep silent upon the dreadful catastrophe	115.80003994948268
you had the fortitude to regain the house assisted by your nurse	91.16125632398374
a duel was the pretext for my wound	175.77473867855372

my recovery lasted six months	338.5601546580961
i never heard you mentioned and i did not dare inquire for you	45.289525512761
when i returned to paris i learned that you the widow of m	55.84455573050359

what was the subject of my thoughts from the time consciousness returned to me a	79.33842417781838
i inquired immediately on my return to paris the house had not been inhabited si	121.1539341561331
i found the tenant	108.89835296629502
i pretended that i disliked the idea that a house belonging to my wifes father a	93.83033181366316
i offered to pay them for cancelling the lease they demanded 6000 francs	152.18144534271661
i would have given 10000i would have given 20000	124.73826366486605

no one had entered the house since i had left it	34.21551921578624

my heart beat so violently that i feared my wound would open	142.7549021193799
at length one by one all the noises in the neighborhood ceased	90.50481392562953
i understood that i had nothing to fear that i should neither be seen nor heard 	47.366203315039265

i seemed to be going mad	152.78835881269075
at last i mastered my agitation	156.93286162133177

i grasped the railings if i had relaxed my hold for a moment i should have falle	67.81112744588454
i reached the lower door	153.72874121419218
outside this door a spade was placed against the wall i took it and advanced tow	91.91020194826676
i had provided myself with a dark lantern	125.17202933995372

i looked carefully around i was indeed aloneno noise disturbed the silence but t	252.32690253793834
i tied my lantern to a forked branch i had noticed a year before at the precise 	85.62945917383212
the grass had grown very thickly there during the summer and when autumn arrived	265.46193069181743
still one place where the grass was thin attracted my attention it evidently was	478.58419768371317
i went to work	116.44433961582486
the hour then for which i had been waiting during the last year had at length ar	101.50065099953093
how i worked how i hoped how i struck every piece of turf thinking to find some 	196.05274532770196
i thought i had been deceivedhad mistaken the spot	185.56573314833224
i turned around i looked at the trees i tried to recall the details which had st	84.68218416573707
a cold sharp wind whistled through the leafless branches and yet the drops fell 	189.35719984201313
i recollected that i was stabbed just as i was trampling the ground to fill up t	69.33486404399814
on my right i saw the tree behind me the rock	66.84626556917163
i stood in the same attitude and threw myself down	79.62711072706773
i rose and again began digging and enlarging the hole still i found nothing noth	193.2687056986301
30269 m	1.051109433389963
the chest no longer there murmured madame danglars choking with fear	242.48066474348346
think not i contented myself with this one effort continued villefort	173.6828359508481
no i searched the whole thicket	106.38445020519022
i thought the assassin having discovered the chest and supposing it to be a trea	48.90988879615467
then the idea struck me that he had not taken these precautions and had simply t	72.12803903801729
in the last case i must wait for daylight to renew my search	130.52756303222975
i remained in the room and waited	101.6273425226419
oh heaven	190.60080183682956
30271 m	1.257734544207479
when daylight dawned i went down again	276.8364543228223
my first visit was to the thicket	95.90350898469708
i hoped to find some traces which had escaped me in the darkness	60.60337392551668
i had turned up the earth over a surface of more than twenty feet square and a d	100.23899621821717
a laborer would not have done in a day what occupied me an hour	102.78916403753232
but i could find nothingabsolutely nothing	217.90765019954057
then i renewed the search	185.90378655726286
supposing it had been thrown aside it would probably be on the path which led to	57.57034565154402
oh cried madame danglars it was enough to drive you mad	44.248812675181185
i hoped for a moment that it might said villefort but that happiness was denied 	57.0145687650205
however recovering my strength and my ideas why said i should that man have carr	181.08991626546603
but you said replied madame danglars he would require it as a proof	83.39022159683981
ah no madame that could not be	78.99143794062165
dead bodies are not kept a year they are shown to a magistrate and the evidence 	117.01302256098154
now nothing of the kind has happened	84.07893160421146
what then asked hermine trembling violently	103.08410967221744
something more terrible more fatal more alarming for usthe child was perhaps ali	126.03537651225973
madame danglars uttered a piercing cry and seizing villeforts hands exclaimed my	98.6043124890661
madame danglars had risen and stood before the procureur whose hands she wrung i	170.96404412935374
i know not i merely suppose so as i might suppose anything else replied villefor	111.6277226319624
ah my child my poor child cried the baroness falling on her chair and stifling h	37.874310241402206
villefort becoming somewhat reassured perceived that to avert the maternal storm	417.1702752990674
you understand then that if it were so said he rising in his turn and approachin	31.74235324205181
this child lives and someone knows it livessomeone is in possession of our secre	153.74992740744167
just god avenging god murmured madame danglars	174.21110830018597
villeforts only answer was a stifled groan	254.99854984919838
but the childthe child sir repeated the agitated mother	586.3409036010878
how i have searched for him replied villefort wringing his hands how i have call	46.17516249595152
a child encumbers a fugitive perhaps on perceiving it was still alive he had thr	106.98437140367804
impossible cried madame danglars a man may murder another out of revenge but he 	102.42436680912432
perhaps continued villefort he had put it in the foundling hospital	49.271697769306975
oh yes yes cried the baroness my child is there	31.939373603907583
i ran to the hospital and learned that the same nightthe night of the 20th of se	59.14021985751608
this portion of the napkin was marked with half a barons crown and the letter h	93.29149362722279
truly truly said madame danglars all my linen is marked thus monsieur de nargonn	91.13678651981488
thank god my child was not then dead	94.72077575218796
no it was not dead	37.275195091584166
and you can tell me so without fearing to make me die of joy where is the child	82.34708277717829
villefort shrugged his shoulders	21.5343423868797
do i know said he and do you believe that if i knew i would relate to you all it	37.88314255166106
a woman about six months after came to claim it with the other half of the napki	50.728997902241375
this woman gave all the requisite particulars and it was intrusted to her	90.10705802522055
but you should have inquired for the woman you should have traced her	72.360499015537
and what do you think i did i feigned a criminal process and employed all the mo	62.97917686560324
they traced her to chlons and there they lost her	120.20399915145244
they lost her	1107.5153300688023
yes forever	5124.127891161614
madame danglars had listened to this recital with a sigh a tear or a shriek for 	72.86553115842892
and this is all said she and you stopped there	75.96242568294798
oh no said villefort i never ceased to search and to inquire	37.362916057805315
however the last two or three years i had allowed myself some respite	80.60465546276505
but now i will begin with more perseverance and fury than ever since fear urges 	160.58701805276917
but replied madame danglars the count of monte cristo can know nothing or he wou	28.307128427049626
oh the wickedness of man is very great said villefort since it surpasses the goo	43.07766035034651
did you observe that mans eyes while he was speaking to us	93.30706462427891
but have you ever watched him carefully	114.80533698939459
doubtless he is capricious but that is all one thing alone struck meof all the e	96.01927660398474
i might have suspected he was poisoning us	276.98777443466025
and you see you would have been deceived	39.92628365933555
yes doubtless	1070.9181346956127
but believe me that man has other projects	425.79659420370973
for that reason i wished to see you to speak to you to warn you against everyone	59.475111898335854
tell me cried villefort fixing his eyes more steadfastly on her than he had ever	40.694078174878626
never to anyone	353.7874159267698
you understand me replied villefort affectionately when i say anyonepardon my ur	72.98630049120788
yes yes i understand very well ejaculated the baroness never i swear to you	51.59696477994445
were you ever in the habit of writing in the evening what had transpired in the 	48.06650318580403
no my life has been passed in frivolity i wish to forget it myself	65.52518410316056
do you talk in your sleep	52.02529345376987
30275 m	1.4120017426765756
i sleep soundly like a child do you not remember	93.6604669587551
the color mounted to the baronesss face and villefort turned awfully pale	70.89172393111303
it is true said he in so low a tone that he could hardly be heard	23.77476865844604
well said the baroness	11.246656524002407
well i understand what i now have to do replied villefort	45.02497606835559
in less than one week from this time i will ascertain who this m	137.81515543151417
de monte cristo is whence he comes where he goes and why he speaks in our presen	52.3137840348418
villefort pronounced these words with an accent which would have made the count 	40.41193052912117
then he pressed the hand the baroness reluctantly gave him and led her respectfu	48.66603696173515
madame danglars returned in another cab to the passage on the other side of whic	43.18667578419919
chapter 68	1608.6515029677423
a summer ball	832.2068597528998
the same day during the interview between madame danglars and the procureur a tr	49.69070957431292
27 and stopped in the yard	53.408205822314706
in a moment the door was opened and madame de morcerf alighted leaning on her so	26.908669492743
albert soon left her ordered his horses and having arranged his toilet drove to 	206.06266325893284
the count received him with his habitual smile	27.679836438698786
it was a strange thing that no one ever appeared to advance a step in that mans 	74.19232084485388
those who would as it were force a passage to his heart found an impassable barr	119.40234450874237
morcerf who ran towards him with open arms was chilled as he drew near in spite 	92.64201738742845
monte cristo shook it coldly according to his invariable practice	164.6115706084927
here i am dear count	47.5050503740447
welcome home again	712.4626525434846
i arrived an hour since	157.4405141480292
from dieppe	9.992836024619974
no from trport	421.33427191049276
and i have come at once to see you	20.629954617977848
that is extremely kind of you said monte cristo with a tone of perfect indiffere	23.767548281559208
and what is the news	22.458979708721497
you should not ask a stranger a foreigner for news	140.76999850562046
i know it but in asking for news i mean have you done anything for me	78.81449297381494
had you commissioned me said monte cristo feigning uneasiness	31.318802485044518
come come said albert do not assume so much indifference	31.199573196752844
it is said sympathy travels rapidly and when at trport i felt the electric shock	218.91996519165122
possibly said monte cristo i have indeed thought of you but the magnetic wire i 	39.145097470917534
30277 m	1.0349335662687573
indeed pray tell me how it happened	93.93441415716244
danglars dined with me	206.90478287422818
i know it to avoid meeting him my mother and i left town	81.72713823327153
but he met here m	173.37609921034144
andrea cavalcanti	15.856879577013713
your italian prince	589.405633237778
not so fast m	183.32836980578415
andrea only calls himself count	873.3013567900733
calls himself do you say	66.2404738857373
yes calls himself	3350.7342379333136
is he not a count	24.989787353955663
what can i know of him he calls himself so	52.53858497526558
i of course give him the same title and everyone else does likewise	227.97303448156887
what a strange man you are what next you say m	167.04898395221065
danglars dined here	1511.5867746048434
yes with count cavalcanti the marquis his father madame danglars m	244.2532658521389
and madame de villefortcharming peoplem	9.138142890945936
debray maximilian morrel and m	33.32465749686159
de chteaurenaud	1.0609428892498438
did they speak of me	47.80745260273719
not a word	30.700391232893026
so much the worse	5.185684244888297
why so i thought you wished them to forget you	67.66522804013013
if they did not speak of me i am sure they thought about me and i am in despair	35.39595194271833
how will that affect you since mademoiselle danglars was not among the number he	124.0439322991494
i have no fear of that or if she did it was only in the same way in which i thin	50.13377960434163
touching sympathy so you hate each other said the count	121.41215510994347
listen said morcerfif mademoiselle danglars were disposed to take pity on my sup	85.40632149453413
in a word mademoiselle danglars would make a charming mistressbut a wifediable	136.05260217365011
and this said monte cristo is your opinion of your intended spouse	67.38821827419639
yes it is rather unkind i acknowledge but it is true	50.92637996060223
but as this dream can not be realized since mademoiselle danglars must become my	120.65501665020308
one may forsake a mistress but a wifegood heavens there she must always be and t	219.08224608621222
you are difficult to please viscount	177.87436390344303
yes for i often wish for what is impossible	96.2131908490937
what is that	6.747764588506397
to find such a wife as my father found	158.53058383514858
monte cristo turned pale and looked at albert while playing with some magnificen	37.360564416288796
your father was fortunate then said he	81.6600195749511
you know my opinion of my mother count look at herstill beautiful witty more cha	138.08913199101048
for any other son to have stayed with his mother for four days at trport it woul	57.91805127082633
30279 m	2.1674659839010464
that is an overwhelming demonstration and you would make everyone vow to live a 	67.2162683042419
such are my reasons for not liking to marry mademoiselle danglars	147.1993676546891
have you ever noticed how much a thing is heightened in value when we obtain pos	90.67859738056251
worldling murmured the count	46.26632997203849
thus i shall rejoice when mademoiselle eugnie perceives i am but a pitiful atom 	102.19717247203171
monte cristo smiled	34.63479915292906
one plan occurred to me continued albert franz likes all that is eccentric i tri	72.54429424992314
that is what i call devoted friendship to recommend to another one whom you woul	96.9240691151078
albert smiled	113.04932310346514
apropos continued he franz is coming soon but it will not interest you you disli	95.02813377006167
i said monte cristo my dear viscount how have you discovered that i did not like	33.50059040373624
franz i like everyone	718.4742316979513
and you include me in the expression everyonemany thanks	218.60795971909099
let us not mistake said monte cristo i love everyone as god commands us to love 	82.92347588800769
let us return to m	14.595081180413992
franz dpinay	245.2821011264711
did you say he was coming	27.77205777780324
yes summoned by m	685.5019661437269
de villefort who is apparently as anxious to get mademoiselle valentine married 	89.89985487741477
danglars is to see mademoiselle eugnie settled	97.83370203485772
it must be a very irksome office to be the father of a grownup daughter it seems	61.044887787338034
but m	461.537123827454
dpinay unlike you bears his misfortune patiently	698.3040127383084
still more he talks seriously about the matter puts on a white tie and speaks of	192.38225246598074
he entertains a very high opinion of m	216.3793751783683
and madame de villefort	6.836484488664005
which they deserve do they not	118.53157563539348
i believe they do	132.17806994637652
de villefort has always passed for a severe but a just man	104.04624586748787
there is then one said monte cristo whom you do not condemn like poor danglars	32.77074009492078
because i am not compelled to marry his daughter perhaps replied albert laughing	49.76040803020374
indeed my dear sir said monte cristo you are revoltingly foppish	24.316008748181208
i foppish how do you mean	53.021229829231366
yes pray take a cigar and cease to defend yourself and to struggle to escape mar	169.7462242977003
let things take their course perhaps you may not have to retract	142.50203894373064
bah said albert staring	36.62795401902963
doubtless my dear viscount you will not be taken by force and seriously do you w	37.1629426501004
i would give a hundred thousand francs to be able to do so	19.480073303750604
then make yourself quite easy	237.81685807519997
danglars would give double that sum to attain the same end	130.1146301773838
am i indeed so happy said albert who still could not prevent an almost impercept	62.41962078201361
but my dear count has m	56.48276497208919
danglars any reason	1394.5297997046143
ah there is your proud and selfish nature	201.48810408902983
you would expose the selflove of another with a hatchet but you shrink if your o	80.32245900925747
but yet m	1338.6949398133029
danglars appeared	285.3259365984831
delighted with you was he not well he is a man of bad taste and is still more en	50.4253527619059
i know not whom look and judge for yourself	292.8630644584828
thank you i understand	20.73639053959237
but my motherno not my mother i mistakemy father intends giving a ball	349.652829434317
a ball at this season	167.80614428771102
summer balls are fashionable	842.1840950312532
if they were not the countess has only to wish it and they would become so	85.29659768654807
you are right you know they are select affairs those who remain in paris in july	102.98000424251188
will you take charge of our invitation to messieurs cavalcanti	45.08883964914876
when will it take place	151.67375318456158
on saturday	51.613156324269674
cavalcantis father will be gone	267.6246139111812
but the son will be here will you invite young m	179.69317284094708
i do not know him viscount	36.23845299142054
you do not know him	10.636595803340523
no i never saw him until a few days since and am not responsible for him	65.48307958871041
but you receive him at your house	47.786131354608976
that is another thing he was recommended to me by a good abb who may be deceived	44.79153269718133
give him a direct invitation but do not ask me to present him	50.154007863201024
if he were afterwards to marry mademoiselle danglars you would accuse me of intr	31.89738959752608
at your ball	160.85317938742037
why should you not be there	35.26665764452769
because you have not yet invited me	34.06797332265711
but i come expressly for that purpose	89.66088615585905
you are very kind but i may be prevented	51.96910980688553
if i tell you one thing you will be so amiable as to set aside all impediments	34.80909131199372
tell me what it is	5.911465996086936
my mother begs you to come	73.87308947039716
the comtesse de morcerf said monte cristo starting	17.51775973023747
ah count said albert i assure you madame de morcerf speaks freely to me and if y	25.83448984509818
you have talked of me	40.56347311851737
yes that is the penalty of being a living puzzle	60.610107519731045
then i am also a puzzle to your mother i should have thought her too reasonable 	90.12618009902931
a problem my dear count for everyonefor my mother as well as others much studied	141.37015783554648
my mother is only astonished that you remain so long unsolved	107.59603818517894
i believe while the countess g takes you for lord ruthven my mother imagines you	100.99950769754096

albert rose and took his hat the count conducted him to the door	29.489588128245057
i have one thing to reproach myself with said he stopping albert on the steps	74.67918664858223
what is it	5.097090961008194
i have spoken to you indiscreetly about danglars	56.972037505832965
on the contrary speak to me always in the same strain about him	64.75524618054341
i am glad to be reassured on that point	32.91648947282655

until saturday when i may expect you may i not	65.78512426634875
yes i promised you	54.01843001759097
the count watched albert waving his hand to him	31.980391141787198

at the end of the second day m	17.835120186199475
de villefort received the following note	57.24314905657748
the person called the count of monte cristo is an intimate acquaintance of lord 	61.90003258950482
de villefort replied by ordering the strictest inquiries to be made respecting t	63.01047674667127
the abb who was in paris only for a month inhabited a small twostoried house beh	52.91261387406863
the two lower rooms consisted of a diningroom with a table chairs and sideboard 	90.38763483833743
it was evident that the abb limited himself to objects of strict necessity	77.60742554626643
he preferred to use the sittingroom upstairs which was more library than parlor 	215.1525749485855
his valet looked at the visitors through a sort of wicket and if their faces wer	57.376151310230235
besides whether at home or not whether in paris or cairo the abb always left som	126.35646963389785

lord wilmore resided in rue fontainesaintgeorges	42.296758224809466
he was one of those english tourists who consume a large fortune in travelling	46.516563992219574
he hired the apartment in which he lived furnished passed only a few hours in th	119.05679167918014
one of his peculiarities was never to speak a word of french which he however wr	44.69410628056184
the day after this important information had been given to the kings attorney a 	44.122165301755565
no he went out early this morning replied the valet	88.91313938304293
i might not always be content with that answer replied the visitor for i come fr	54.047827886039805
but have the kindness to give the abb busoni	34.756837727556245
i told you he was not at home repeated the valet	32.761021973461844
then on his return give him that card and this sealed paper	192.31759015573948
will he be at home at eight oclock this evening	18.272242591148352
doubtless unless he is at work which is the same as if he were out	91.32110167897692
i will come again at that time replied the visitor who then retired	50.334989753701535
at the appointed hour the same man returned in the same carriage which instead o	45.188947274844075
he knocked and it opened immediately to admit him	175.21674163803246
from the signs of respect the valet paid him he saw that his note had produced a	80.80118370995405
is the abb at home asked he	80.52858949298488
yes he is at work in his library but he expects you sir replied the valet	69.5082563127398
the stranger ascended a rough staircase and before a table illumined by a lamp w	84.81958619787498
have i the honor of addressing the abb busoni asked the visitor	29.62063849961003
yes sir replied the abb and you are the person whom m	28.04356819630008
de boville formerly an inspector of prisons sends to me from the prefect of poli	29.834100630508814
exactly sir	184.093029870338
one of the agents appointed to secure the safety of paris	39.28169853245488
yes sir replied the stranger with a slight hesitation and blushing	32.237879626417055
the abb replaced the large spectacles which covered not only his eyes but his te	107.06628041155984
i am at your service sir said the abb with a marked italian accent	11.819586564605123
the mission with which i am charged sir replied the visitor speaking with hesita	103.83986181235322
the abb bowed	55.20473859951305
your probity replied the stranger is so well known to the prefect that he wishes	62.8568601805328
it is hoped that no ties of friendship or humane consideration will induce you t	66.67296428268199
provided sir the particulars you wish for do not interfere with my scruples or m	114.67791026307243
i am a priest sir and the secrets of confession for instance must remain between	97.52657013088688
do not alarm yourself monsieur we will duly respect your conscience	184.27298389898496
at this moment the abb pressed down his side of the shade and so raised it on th	33.016072732398825
excuse me abb said the envoy of the prefect of the police but the light tries my	67.9771111114314
the abb lowered the shade	208.25002376021212
now sir i am listeninggo on	64.96025835027775
i will come at once to the point	26.53261976003606
do you know the count of monte cristo	4.666978436524847
you mean monsieur zaccone i presume	57.05843772406498
zacconeis not his name monte cristo	69.29378085103932
monte cristo is the name of an estate or rather of a rock and not a family name	51.60380496462038
well be it solet us not dispute about words and since m	339.9309484261769
de monte cristo and m	12.424978875762779
zaccone are the same	51.017841142501595
absolutely the same	39.393869605098764
let us speak of m	20.386667515576683
i asked you if you knew him	51.16641650950934
extremely well	21.132376251186596
who is he	26.868051402256935
the son of a rich shipbuilder in malta	56.80025230289845
i know that is the report but as you are aware the police does not content itsel	46.90621831306404
however replied the abb with an affable smile when that report is in accordance 	39.34472256960898
are you sure of what you assert	17.092845800992837
what do you mean by that question	21.41543041428944
understand sir i do not in the least suspect your veracity i ask if you are cert	43.25792453384387
i knew his father m	216.7296372122489
ah indeed	54.09186441373032
and when a child i often played with the son in the timberyards	158.8408951575014
but whence does he derive the title of count	136.18143988621088
you are aware that may be bought	63.530994020002595
in italy	40.729098860626344
and his immense riches whence does he procure them	366.17870212144066
they may not be so very great	57.296427669209024
how much do you suppose he possesses	51.62327246561203
from one hundred and fifty to two hundred thousand livres per annum	34.70909785753246
that is reasonable said the visitor i have heard he had three or four millions	38.93484286025807
two hundred thousand per annum would make four millions of capital	46.29371640234938
but i was told he had four millions per annum	42.41825700618368
that is not probable	21.06036012969827
do you know this island of monte cristo	11.013439256889217
certainly everyone who has come from palermo naples or rome to france by sea mus	46.647826437894814
i am told it is a delightful place	66.73756540950234
it is a rock	25.080525658231014
and why has the count bought a rock	101.94758308011654
for the sake of being a count	24.871450019439163
in italy one must have territorial possessions to be a count	96.47712144445245
you have doubtless heard the adventures of m	60.51890636846144
zaccones youth	54412.87092839643
the fathers	5559.191961176659
no the sons	1006.9444351390074
i know nothing certain at that period of his life i lost sight of my young comra	64.25248108912405
was he in the wars	49.93989816700889
i think he entered the service	100.06855138044736
in what branch	332.39055688455534
in the navy	77.4430337582219
are you not his confessor	37.88202259463393
no sir i believe he is a lutheran	20.828517274499387
a lutheran	52.898764032440816
i say i believe such is the case i do not affirm it besides liberty of conscienc	61.95495714094349
doubtless and we are not now inquiring into his creed but his actions in the nam	96.34573191484046
he passes for a very charitable man	104.2895349067136
our holy father the pope has made him a knight of jesus christ for the services 	56.48096048447815
does he wear them	99.50143267918652
no but he is proud of them he is better pleased with rewards given to the benefa	66.89026724588015
he is a quaker then	27.190143545075784
exactly he is a quaker with the exception of the peculiar dress	41.37405957909651
has he any friends	131.64342114543751
yes everyone who knows him is his friend	162.64786776489206
but has he any enemies	213.18710757387637
one only	668.6925337711758
what is his name	10.434449673332034
lord wilmore	3.9479726923037215
where is he	10.318201912273116
he is in paris just now	58.506790150506454
can he give me any particulars	92.04401299553531
important ones he was in india with zaccone	59.09238338291842
do you know his abode	54.98799492066933
its somewhere in the chausse dantin but i know neither the street nor the number	107.99490861476816
30289 m	1.2666088288254989
are you at variance with the englishman	17.793912786381746
i love zaccone and he hates him we are consequently not friends	184.16809912161946
do you think the count of monte cristo had ever been in france before he made th	16.39542472165902
to that question i can answer positively no sir he had not because he applied to	140.38335711460087
cavalcanti to him	137.89870500395506
no bartolomeo his father	210.797263551277
now sir i have but one question more to ask and i charge you in the name of hono	34.05325864408303
what is it sir	13.158015748757466
do you know with what design m	50.149894601211855
de monte cristo purchased a house at auteuil	26.250947999734628
certainly for he told me	41.01341201750421
what is it sir	12.810572362478402
to make a lunatic asylum of it similar to that founded by the count of pisani at	45.00828656256542
do you know about that institution	28.671555474030832
i have heard of it	14.223842762472774
it is a magnificent charity	36.65950168297983
having said this the abb bowed to imply he wished to pursue his studies	123.32317746273145
the visitor either understood the abbs meaning or had no more questions to ask h	135.36814745043876
you are a great almsgiver said the visitor and although you are said to be rich 	41.695239950763096
i thank you sir i am only jealous in one thing and that is that the relief i giv	37.308180815386464
my resolution sir is unchangeable but you have only to search for yourself and y	72.63920704208847
the abb once more bowed as he opened the door the stranger bowed and took his le	88.18083661887849

an hour afterwards the carriage was again ordered and this time it went to the r	32.65047468061219
5 where lord wilmore lived	364.46059059178583
the stranger had written to lord wilmore requesting an interview which the latte	90.4167321442694
as the envoy of the prefect of police arrived ten minutes before ten he was told	85.37659748559327
the visitor was introduced into the drawingroom which was like all other furnish	118.091874305662
a mantlepiece with two modern svres vases a timepiece representing cupid with hi	135.8975097918632
it was illuminated by lamps with groundglass shades which gave only a feeble lig	90.10675726096814
after ten minutes expectation the clock struck ten at the fifth stroke the door 	53.49522102642497
he was rather above the middle height with thin reddish whiskers light complexio	151.9289809860049
he was dressed with all the english peculiarity namely in a blue coat with gilt 	57.78773313117982
his first remark on entering was	124.39405378856836
you know sir i do not speak french	23.02147330878867
i know you do not like to converse in our language replied the envoy	61.86913680377656
but you may use it replied lord wilmore i understand it	49.66245022152399
and i replied the visitor changing his idiom know enough of english to keep up t	151.0124249349746
do not put yourself to the slightest inconvenience	79.59696891623891
aw said lord wilmore with that tone which is only known to natives of great brit	63.25277957034279
the envoy presented his letter of introduction which the latter read with englis	133.4571204981535
i understand said he perfectly	71.6227563384238
30293 m	2.0497613456113126
then began the questions which were similar to those which had been addressed to	84.02819050148675
but as lord wilmore in the character of the counts enemy was less restrained in 	101.65235080082721
it was there wilmore had first met him and fought against him and in that war za	84.83742437588673
then began his travels his duels his caprices then the insurrection in greece br	236.94753947115365
while in that service he had discovered a silver mine in the mountains of thessa	53.75677212937202
after the battle of navarino when the greek government was consolidated he asked	45.52128797978446
hence that immense fortune which in lord wilmores opinion possibly amounted to o	275.6767103562801
but asked the visitor do you know why he came to france	34.06656816989797
he is speculating in railways said lord wilmore and as he is an expert chemist a	41.56331439432172
how much does he spend yearly asked the prefect	84.68561650231898
not more than five or six hundred thousand francs said lord wilmore he is a mise	15.60426522329912
hatred evidently inspired the englishman who knowing no other reproach to bring 	266.5386640144245
do you know his house at auteuil	20.893801850185273
what do you know respecting it	31.649214962623017
do you wish to know why he bought it	34.067867731129446
the count is a speculator who will certainly ruin himself in experiments	94.95883024746203
he supposes there is in the neighborhood of the house he has bought a mineral sp	44.38465877146803
he is going to turn his house into a badhaus as the germans term it	56.04163594433484

what was the cause of your quarrel	40.1035803645668
when he was in england he seduced the wife of one of my friends	36.164208554641476
why do you not seek revenge	46.61761854104868
i have already fought three duels with him said the englishman the first with th	40.724544856092656
and what was the result of those duels	37.86002757126203
the first time he broke my arm the second he wounded me in the breast and the th	54.982043230320734
the englishman turned down his shirtcollar and showed a scar whose redness prove	130.9284453412427
so that you see there is a deadly feud between us	46.31772871626597
but said the envoy you do not go about it in the right way to kill him if i unde	33.88970711591565

at the time the countess of morcerf returned to the rooms after giving her order	65.90930489630959
madame danglars in whom the events we have related had caused deep anxiety had h	136.345307926093
the latter made a sign and when the carriages had drawn close together said	71.96324278635369
you are going to madame de morcerfs are you not	10.436594348572974
no replied madame danglars i am too ill	20.3252110585821
you are wrong replied villefort significantly it is important that you should be	27.56225482682459

i do	18.33578698173708
in that case i will go	13.296122333058852

madame danglars therefore came not only beautiful in person but radiant with spl	196.61342860612876
the countess took albert to meet madame danglars	44.55343573982525
he approached paid her some well merited compliments on her toilet and offered h	244.07431853129592
albert looked around him	18.353447971414738
you are looking for my daughter said the baroness smiling	31.78155679531262
i confess it replied albert	20.82742480394227
could you have been so cruel as not to bring her	52.075925565808994

seventeen replied albert	16.918848028403684
what do you mean	3.8206000473099984
i only mean that the count seems the rage replied the viscount smiling and that 	121.84138426845419
the count is in fashion i congratulate him upon it	105.83723844463273
and have you replied to everyone as you have to me	64.45958982919463

i wager anything said albert interrupting her that i know what you were about to	48.05206582074448
well what is it	9.60795233293987
if i guess rightly will you confess it	62.201772213401554
on your honor	20.047564433542863
on my honor	10.121920964859642
you were going to ask me if the count of monte cristo had arrived or was expecte	23.55028598790221
not at all	14.253635340294013
it is not of him that i am now thinking	29.31969341340035
i was going to ask you if you had received any news of monsieur franz	26.648979173808527
what did he tell you	24.651512950549378
that he was leaving at the same time as his letter	32.91884392782215
well now then the count	35.66495956905145
the count will come of that you may be satisfied	43.71969349504491
you know that he has another name besides monte cristo	45.00086145338333
no i did not know it	9.93455730344013
monte cristo is the name of an island and he has a family name	29.303578074521013
i never heard it	60.62065735805194
well then i am better informed than you his name is zaccone	64.03061718344242
it is possible	12.84078726431308
he is a maltese	13.236554754259998
that is also possible	171.67803324932402
the son of a shipowner	48.14858056649907
really you should relate all this aloud you would have the greatest success	146.6619227186324
he served in india discovered a mine in thessaly and comes to paris to establish	145.36995433565576
well i m sure said morcerf this is indeed news am i allowed to repeat it	89.45325872057363
yes but cautiously tell one thing at a time and do not say i told you	84.28139883055836
why so	27.56990494393118
because it is a secret just discovered	70.86559840255734
by whom	24.897513346761293
the police	581.1097803179135
then the news originated	379.36940658345515
at the prefects last night	198.02834693143177
paris you can understand is astonished at the sight of such unusual splendor and	74.48881040149281
well well nothing more is wanting than to arrest the count as a vagabond on the 	110.5337950715637
indeed that doubtless would have happened if his credentials had not been so fav	61.04375256753191
poor count and is he aware of the danger he has been in	45.92404956299929
i think not	27.495826336059505
then it will be but charitable to inform him	51.543013256360965
when he arrives i will not fail to do so	34.810361102669155
just then a handsome young man with bright eyes black hair and glossy moustache 	40.06064382195711
albert extended his hand	26.090758795145657
madame said albert allow me to present to you m	14.726016014893348

i have already had the pleasure of meeting this gentleman at auteuil at the hous	33.04391860569945
this answer and especially the tone in which it was uttered chilled the heart of	123.872460383788
but a recompense was in store for him turning around he saw near the door a beau	56.62782396741984
the salutation was so well understood that morrel with the same expression in hi	42.83841821482386
they might have remained much longer lost in one another without anyone noticing	286.8673595410421
the count of monte cristo had just entered	12.170994536631127
we have already said that there was something in the count which attracted unive	48.102810544797855
it was not the coat unexceptional in its cut though simple and unornamented it w	104.91850826581728
many men might have been handsomer but certainly there could be none whose appea	97.6814127037378
everything about the count seemed to have its meaning for the constant habit of 	70.00185941791032
yet the parisian world is so strange that even all this might not have won atten	62.0881888183939
30301 m	1.0694987740248714
meanwhile he advanced through the assemblage of guests under a battery of curiou	72.69568741786567
she turned towards him with a serene smile just at the moment he was bowing to h	30.442587513562493
no doubt she fancied the count would speak to her while on his side the count th	54.59678324285038
have you seen my mother asked albert	16.301216525016176
i have just had the pleasure replied the count but i have not seen your father	30.651469825236394
see he is down there talking politics with that little group of great geniuses	282.14853252076324
indeed said monte cristo and so those gentlemen down there are men of great tale	113.79595179602562
i should not have guessed it	32.09887711671946
and for what kind of talent are they celebrated you know there are different sor	107.55079599363806
that tall harshlooking man is very learned he discovered in the neighborhood of 	154.58665224544652
the thing was discussed for a long time but finally decided in his favor	70.93690020718661
i can assure you the vertebra made a great noise in the learned world and the ge	80.47323713301108
come said monte cristo this cross seems to me to be wisely awarded	25.957867253388212
i suppose had he found another additional vertebra they would have made him a co	122.37519728101714
very likely said albert	13.971874394842859
and who can that person be who has taken it into his head to wrap himself up in 	73.959724348262
oh that coat is not his own idea it is the republics which deputed david12 to de	70.39678043086074
indeed said monte cristo so this gentleman is an academician	46.577734534415484
within the last week he has been made one of the learned assembly	63.93966541928646
and what is his especial talent	66.34187905457954
his talent i believe he thrusts pins through the heads of rabbits he makes fowls	293.6791851688042
and he is made a member of the academy of sciences for this	43.86531324070215
no of the french academy	17.85678140206234
but what has the french academy to do with all this	19.338005808655865
i was going to tell you	10.892891268206043
it seems	24.83617486517471
that his experiments have very considerably advanced the cause of science doubtl	229.44278292037617
no that his style of writing is very good	161.51616281096662
this must be very flattering to the feelings of the rabbits into whose heads he 	79.91486615594452
albert laughed	2562.407257829293
and the other one demanded the count	44.978379000505974
that one	147.96135180516237
yes the third	157.28743869780473
the one in the dark blue coat	81.9484392248423
he is a colleague of the count and one of the most active opponents to the idea 	36.38769441106222
he was very successful upon that question	120.74877398280664
he stood badly with the liberal papers but his noble opposition to the wishes of	136.4878942347366
they talk of making him an ambassador	139.8700647115805
30303 m	1.1174685975891294
and what are his claims to the peerage	73.98180462581225
he has composed two or three comic operas written four or five articles in the s	74.72431791100844
bravo viscount said monte cristo smiling you are a delightful cicerone	37.827113091084776
and now you will do me a favor will you not	53.29166874464157
what is it	5.240032000329936
do not introduce me to any of these gentlemen and should they wish it you will w	68.04673963192928
just then the count felt his arm pressed	50.61926028315771
he turned round it was danglars	52.97153511063646
ah is it you baron said he	49.664178957430906
why do you call me baron said danglars you know that i care nothing for my title	29.254713239728904
i am not like you viscount you like your title do you not	69.7775422618281
certainly replied albert seeing that without my title i should be nothing while 	118.33431469206668
which seems to me the finest title under the royalty of july replied danglars	74.86105338698252
unfortunately said monte cristo ones title to a millionaire does not last for li	99.96849242360983
indeed said danglars becoming pale	22.499261248711832
yes i received the news this evening by a courier	80.50294302987305
i had about a million in their hands but warned in time i withdrew it a month ag	101.14809515027203
ah mon dieu exclaimed danglars they have drawn on me for 200000 francs	30.684607036236283
well you can throw out the draft their signature is worth five per cent	98.3136051725819
yes but it is too late said danglars i have honored their bills	33.2182743521576
then said monte cristo here are 200000 francs gone after	65.1629676605645
hush do not mention these things said danglars then approaching monte cristo he 	58.56965066786219
cavalcanti after which he smiled and turned towards the young man in question	91.38757598074582
albert had left the count to speak to his mother danglars to converse with young	55.282790761454066
meanwhile the heat became excessive	348.50297098141147
the footmen were hastening through the rooms with waiters loaded with ices	149.90512786077167
monte cristo wiped the perspiration from his forehead but drew back when the wai	30.405028372041027
madame de morcerf did not lose sight of monte cristo she saw that he took nothin	13.319128192135093
albert she asked did you notice that	83.99846547978173

but your house is not m	75.4882123856636
de morcerfs murmured mercds and since he has been here i have watched him	35.02410267440919
well he has taken nothing yet	105.39546536945898
the count is very temperate	66.7120164714804
mercds smiled sadly	50.479157377770434
approach him said she and when the next waiter passes insist upon his taking som	175.00431967941103
but why mother	1661.5407954340924
just to please me albert said mercds	27.75078483151532
albert kissed his mothers hand and drew near the count	52.79167017571185
another salver passed loaded like the preceding ones she saw albert attempt to p	251.75855576998276
albert rejoined his mother she was very pale	83.71041445082253
well said she you see he refuses	72.51520836581342
yes but why need this annoy you	130.92488679137824
you know albert women are singular creatures	268.3016921546535
i should like to have seen the count take something in my house if only an ice	98.71722076374563
perhaps he can not reconcile himself to the french style of living and might pre	78.46295107735519

and besides said the countess accustomed as he is to burning climates possibly h	186.7322494704839
i do not think that for he has complained of feeling almost suffocated and asked	115.50020980995232
in a word said mercds it was a way of assuring me that his abstinence was intend	38.3171976025027
and she left the room	27.693408104999346
a minute afterwards the blinds were thrown open and through the jessamine and cl	45.52092982820703
dancers players talkers all uttered an exclamation of joyeveryone inhaled with d	436.8566470705979
at the same time mercds reappeared paler than before but with that imperturbable	46.87151814818678
she went straight to the group of which her husband formed the centre	65.1472781269006
do not detain those gentlemen here count she said they would prefer i should thi	114.78475529706411
ah said a gallant old general who in 1809 had sung partant pour la syriewe will 	161.70604399887316
then said mercds i will lead the way	27.177233201375937
turning towards monte cristo she added count will you oblige me with your arm	83.22774713716218
the count almost staggered at these simple words then he fixed his eyes on mercd	77.19001307748005
it was only a momentary glance but it seemed to the countess to have lasted for 	60.84489162370186
he offered his arm to the countess she took it or rather just touched it with he	59.14498589253903
behind them by another outlet a group of about twenty persons rushed into the ga	83.4684334030668
chapter 71	1020.9167799387546
bread and salt	108.2883702677079
madame de morcerf entered an archway of trees with her companion	59.965737954043
it led through a grove of lindens to a conservatory	135.54939194347676
it was too warm in the room was it not count she asked	66.97723969830548
yes madame and it was an excellent idea of yours to open the doors and the blind	46.64834916112292
as he ceased speaking the count felt the hand of mercds tremble	86.39073398367803
but you he said with that light dress and without anything to cover you but that	130.74645911105443
do you know where i am leading you said the countess without replying to the que	23.51121117925146
no madame replied monte cristo but you see i make no resistance	23.869345583277855
we are going to the greenhouse that you see at the other end of the grove	18.956489017351977
the count looked at mercds as if to interrogate her but she continued to walk on	26.657278282751964
they reached the building ornamented with magnificent fruits which ripen at the 	124.36772040230733
the countess left the arm of monte cristo and gathered a bunch of muscatel grape	29.74235620032648
see count she said with a smile so sad in its expression that one could almost d	61.946272276568116
the count bowed but stepped back	71.34257314145425
do you refuse said mercds in a tremulous voice	11.57967784447006
pray excuse me madame replied monte cristo but i never eat muscatel grapes	35.93674848057847
mercds let them fall and sighed	92.105918711937
a magnificent peach was hanging against an adjoining wall ripened by the same ar	76.29199543525603
mercds drew near and plucked the fruit	234.04892311031733
take this peach then she said	109.6194485072029
the count again refused	203.48325284660433
what again she exclaimed in so plaintive an accent that it seemed to stifle a so	67.78995141621843
a long silence followed the peach like the grapes fell to the ground	104.689175990608
count added mercds with a supplicating glance there is a beautiful arabian custo	39.107130916210856
i know it madame replied the count but we are in france and not in arabia and in	20.45565812807399
but said the countess breathlessly with her eyes fixed on monte cristo whose arm	47.62973270588671
the count became pale as death the blood rushed to his heart and then again risi	47.505809227908564
certainly we are friends he replied why should we not be	57.79966582455875
the answer was so little like the one mercds desired that she turned away to giv	83.82037600818722
thank you she said	18.935868362010673
and they walked on again	125.30269193389894
they went the whole length of the garden without uttering a word	65.27271349925262
sir suddenly exclaimed the countess after their walk had continued ten minutes i	213.56336137552248
i have suffered deeply madame answered monte cristo	90.5101654350657
but now you are happy	69.65915933701142
doubtless replied the count since no one hears me complain	57.185911395976994
and your present happiness has it softened your heart	183.87186340642816
my present happiness equals my past misery said the count	123.10103579204376
are you not married asked the countess	14.05433634051675
i married exclaimed monte cristo shuddering who could have told you so	108.178905847984
no one told me you were but you have frequently been seen at the opera with a yo	36.02663609380662
she is a slave whom i bought at constantinople madame the daughter of a prince	50.6479071077332
i have adopted her as my daughter having no one else to love in the world	62.49866442899357

you have no sisterno sonno father	112.342782590691
i have no one	14.124027918819053
how can you exist thus without anyone to attach you to life	99.48549210678522
it is not my fault madame	13.103577373676925
at malta i loved a young girl was on the point of marrying her when war came and	85.64775355378411
i thought she loved me well enough to wait for me and even to remain faithful to	93.1592894436622
when i returned she was married	127.87927010453656
this is the history of most men who have passed twenty years of age	25.645083167378967
perhaps my heart was weaker than the hearts of most men and i suffered more than	73.08757659482427

because madame de saintmran is just arrived in paris bringing the news of m	30.59564467429608
de saintmrans death which took place on the first stage after he left marseilles	51.345567108738855
madame de villefort who was in very good spirits would neither believe nor think	62.155312170885864
and how was m	136.21975773478275
de saintmran related to mademoiselle de villefort said the count	17.51187177123975
he was her grandfather on the mothers side	82.42341225853045

the servants standing in the doorway not daring to approach nearer were looking 	318.2879955338063

villefort stood with his mouth half open quite stupefied	279.00238794538205
of course you sent for a doctor	57.015928114472445
immediately but as i have told you it was too late	18.053617338103045
yes but then he could tell of what complaint the poor marquis had died	137.29475456821567
oh yes sir he told me it appears to have been an apoplectic stroke	44.992675939309805
and what did you do then	10.40926907804516

villefort thought it would be terrible to reply that valentine was at a ball so 	35.36763337744045
this instant sirthis instant i beseech you said the old lady	126.49807960639085
villefort placed the arm of madame de saintmran within his own and conducted her	38.179744860304204
rest yourself mother he said	141.82902298900652

villefort left her to the care of the women while old barrois ran halfscared to 	75.42337620166205
then while madame de saintmran remained on her knees praying fervently villefort	51.67463444774648
he was so pale when he appeared at the door of the ballroom that valentine ran t	25.647596253128707
oh father some misfortune has happened	93.19194519681189
your grandmamma has just arrived valentine said m	83.70562463952479
de villefort	1.053552030332308
and grandpapa inquired the young girl trembling with apprehension	72.14534095742748
de villefort only replied by offering his arm to his daughter	64.09809829743128
it was just in time for valentines head swam and she staggered madame de villefo	69.78010429328398
what a singular event who could have thought it ah yes it is indeed strange	70.1737073343084
and the wretched family departed leaving a cloud of sadness hanging over the res	77.0994104872626
at the foot of the stairs valentine found barrois awaiting her	33.89731927023104
noirtier wishes to see you tonight he said in an undertone	40.596532682688746

valentine found her grandmother in bed silent caresses heartwrung sobs broken si	357.0222413160917
she soon whispered to her husband	65.13463604399456
i think it would be better for me to retire with your permission for the sight o	26.169897862565904
madame de saintmran heard her	19.40848153620733
yes yes she said softly to valentine let her leave but do you stay	80.65313694386371
madame de villefort left and valentine remained alone beside the bed for the pro	24.167678837413757
meanwhile barrois had returned for the first time to old noirtier who having hea	32.84399202313124
alas sir exclaimed barrois a great misfortune has happened	30.444351277720045
madame de saintmran has arrived and her husband is dead	21.241829721059805
de saintmran and noirtier had never been on strict terms of friendship still the	53.12986607020695
noirtier let his head fall upon his chest apparently overwhelmed and thoughtful 	191.33584364498566
barrois asked mademoiselle valentine	99.73233509148758
noirtier nodded his head	51.3607980883446
she is at the ball as you know since she came to say goodbye to you in full dres	58.72169321878816
noirtier again closed his left eye	297.63006597233044
do you wish to see her noirtier again made an affirmative sign	38.36606729323488

is that what you wish for	41.593321175535564
yes replied the invalid	33.36493228628658
barrois therefore as we have seen watched for valentine and informed her of her 	54.13634984704125
consequently valentine came up to noirtier on leaving madame de saintmran who in	24.208791233189842
within reach of her hand they placed a small table upon which stood a bottle of 	110.38489383813514
then as we have said the young girl left the bedside to see m	30.793482972547057
valentine kissed the old man who looked at her with such tenderness that her eye	30.948953669562837
the old gentleman continued to dwell upon her with the same expression	72.56083102207407
yes yes said valentine you mean that i have yet a kind grandfather left do you n	59.13167579768608
the old man intimated that such was his meaning	73.3580306162354
ah yes happily i have replied valentine	52.25798655321772
without that what would become of me	51.10900353915476
it was one oclock in the morning	10.463647072292083
barrois who wished to go to bed himself observed that after such sad events ever	147.31768554675105
noirtier would not say that the only rest he needed was to see his child but wis	77.79868634771829
the next morning she found her grandmother in bed the fever had not abated on th	53.08344859703604
oh dear grandmamma are you worse exclaimed valentine perceiving all these signs 	106.39074067046428
no my child no said madame de saintmran but i was impatiently waiting for your a	40.086822664783455
my father inquired valentine uneasily	114.68600358659778

valentine durst not oppose her grandmothers wish the cause of which she did not 	92.48695997018382
sir said madame de saintmran without using any circumlocution and as if fearing 	57.98553243562271

our civil dissensions are now happily extinguished mother said villefort m	335.0727739780056
dpinay was quite a child when his father died he knows very little of m	138.4776423045853
noirtier and will meet him if not with pleasure at least with indifference	100.01512327645456
is it a suitable match	82.58490721339265
in every respect	189.51075940647326
and the young man	8.264868468204234

you approve of him	194.5020077853984
he is one of the most wellbred young men i know	17.11787392836777
during the whole of this conversation valentine had remained silent	36.183173785836274

the poor child appeared herself to require the doctor she had recommended to her	98.29691745850857

the doctor was a friend of the family and at the same time one of the cleverest 	19.95041396385428

the sound of a kiss was heard and valentine fled through the avenue	44.714708892660404
morrel listened to catch the last sound of her dress brushing the branches and o	102.5848821737913
the young man returned home and waited all the evening and all the next day with	54.31586206016459

it was to this effect	40.90759046889928

morrel went also to the notary who confirmed the news that the contract was to b	58.659396761077126
then he went to call on monte cristo and heard still more	55.257332006746246
franz had been to announce the ceremony and madame de villefort had also written	40.34174309324132
de saintmran and the dangerous illness of his widow would cast a gloom over the 	85.69787893455427
the day before franz had been presented to madame de saintmran who had left her 	16.86284331925956
it is easy to suppose that morrels agitation would not escape the counts penetra	44.135516622678864
monte cristo was more affectionate than everindeed his manner was so kind that s	51.76258915228318
but he recalled the promise he had made to valentine and kept his secret	56.55305014164871
the young man read valentines letter twenty times in the course of the day	44.942704744300144
it was her first and on what an occasion each time he read it he renewed his vow	186.72129776400374
how great is the power of a woman who has made so courageous a resolution what d	53.428914521004955

when the afternoon arrived and he felt that the hour was drawing near he wished 	119.02818268314621
he shut himself in his room and tried to read but his eye glanced over the page 	55.85571429530603
at length the hour drew near	78.11770772208719
never did a man deeply in love allow the clocks to go on peacefully	161.43162037964953
morrel tormented his so effectually that they struck eight at halfpast six	423.57813816567557

the clock struck halfpast eight and still another halfhour was passed in waiting	280.40466910536173
the garden became darker still but in the darkness he looked in vain for the whi	72.71374960799325
the house which was discernible through the trees remained in darkness and gave 	116.7033180996312
morrel looked at his watch which wanted a quarter to ten but soon the same clock	85.14892149004459
this was already half an hour past the time valentine had fixed	66.1650580881035
it was a terrible moment for the young man	19.69606130697372
the slightest rustling of the foliage the least whistling of the wind attracted 	134.21783715225763
amidst all these alternations of hope and fear the clock struck ten	100.49714874340413
it is impossible said maximilian that the signing of a contract should occupy so	51.16486725687561
i have weighed all the chances calculated the time required for all the forms so	216.52253001898598
and then he walked rapidly to and fro and pressed his burning forehead against t	82.73433011121621
had valentine fainted or had she been discovered and stopped in her flight these	117.82902785494181
the idea that her strength had failed her in attempting to escape and that she h	79.34966093156793
in that case said he i should lose her and by my own fault	51.43066866200136
he dwelt on this idea for a moment then it appeared reality	177.12396276978646
he even thought he could perceive something on the ground at a distance he ventu	79.0030399368286
at last the halfhour struck	81.35946238462355
it was impossible to wait longer his temples throbbed violently his eyes were gr	102.11368095990261
he was on villeforts premiseshad arrived there by scaling the wall	89.42263793282372
what might be the consequences however he had not ventured thus far to draw back	112.85795681871915
he followed a short distance close under the wall then crossed a path hid entere	97.36426584090914
in a moment he had passed through them and could see the house distinctly	58.97834673250603
30341 m	1.0080519915246458
then morrel saw that he had been right in believing that the house was not illum	26.046922323316505
instead of lights at every window as is customary on days of ceremony he saw onl	128.86226804992444
a light moved rapidly from time to time past three windows of the second floor	89.96465114798728
these three windows were in madame de saintmrans room	42.54173774657259
another remained motionless behind some red curtains which were in madame de vil	133.44089396960302
morrel guessed all this	240.93601554773443
so many times in order to follow valentine in thought at every hour in the day h	51.93691712898647
this darkness and silence alarmed morrel still more than valentines absence had 	309.66063458190786
almost mad with grief and determined to venture everything in order to see valen	62.00407611336082
at this sound as he was already partially exposed to view he stepped back and co	88.83804347266528
he had formed his resolution	122.53121597868532
if it was valentine alone he would speak as she passed if she was accompanied an	72.82155727185524
the moon had just then escaped from behind the cloud which had concealed it and 	108.25759963277252
they descended and advanced towards the clump of trees and morrel soon recognize	91.62472409738298
30339 m	1.0676261153830322
the young man seeing them approach drew back mechanically until he found himself	116.58401313702525
soon the two gentlemen stopped also	135.48515998995643
ah my dear doctor said the procureur heaven declares itself against my house wha	78.76268487396753
the cold sweat sprang to the young mans brow and his teeth chattered	55.31298222037515
who could be dead in that house which villefort himself had called accursed	140.18842940922082
my dear m	9.250726785352937
de villefort replied the doctor with a tone which redoubled the terror of the yo	13.927152089569248
what can you mean asked the procureur alarmed	32.30899296907938
i mean that behind the misfortune which has just happened to you there is anothe	61.228926427892844
can it be possible murmured villefort clasping his hands	24.89305578749521
what are you going to tell me	5.8056336157499615
are we quite alone my friend	70.98897652652127
yes quite but why all these precautions	226.49261194569684
because i have a terrible secret to communicate to you said the doctor	35.71077864863003
let us sit down	4.312537137395548
villefort fell rather than seated himself	520.9615660899719
the doctor stood before him with one hand placed on his shoulder	56.80474850301268
morrel horrified supported his head with one hand and with the other pressed his	105.508603117361
dead dead repeated he within himself and he felt as if he were also dying	111.4661854423801

madame de saintmran was doubtless advancing in years but she enjoyed excellent h	105.78945686345709
morrel began again to breathe freely which he had not done during the last ten m	87.38807647396534

it is not grief my dear villefort said the doctor grief may kill although it rar	74.59878739503311
villefort answered nothing he simply raised his head which had been cast down be	130.78861096887
were you present during the last struggle asked m	136.6494594659397
i was replied the procureur you begged me not to leave	62.41179334225921
did you notice the symptoms of the disease to which madame de saintmran has fall	29.823148615251174
i did	92.45340503086099
madame de saintmran had three successive attacks at intervals of some minutes ea	40.86075351455946
when you arrived madame de saintmran had already been panting for breath some mi	56.3997643937271
then i understood from your countenance there was more to fear than i had though	107.24025769168477
this crisis past i endeavored to catch your eye but could not	241.13933682530086
you held her handyou were feeling her pulseand the second fit came on before you	386.19970960786975
this was more terrible than the first the same nervous movements were repeated a	98.24223349109954
and at the third she expired	196.22801495428385
at the end of the first attack i discovered symptoms of tetanus you confirmed my	65.7182173118902
yes before others replied the doctor but now we are alone	107.41252014454645
what are you going to say oh spare me	27.693672211179134
that the symptoms of tetanus and poisoning by vegetable substances are the same	42.809401351252
de villefort started from his seat then in a moment fell down again silent and m	67.09669555163674
morrel knew not if he were dreaming or awake	102.69314207759096
listen said the doctor i know the full importance of the statement i have just m	36.924719618655395
do you speak to me as a magistrate or as a friend asked villefort	25.404243072575156
as a friend and only as a friend at this moment	43.214361662560414
the similarity in the symptoms of tetanus and poisoning by vegetable substances 	61.86308929116678
and to that friend i say during the threequarters of an hour that the struggle c	158.01308724480344
can it be possible	22.50559731038108
the symptoms are marked do you seesleep broken by nervous spasms excitation of t	294.87810315756315
madame de saintmran succumbed to a powerful dose of brucine or of strychnine whi	52.074621915968045
villefort seized the doctors hand	86.45135207387044
oh it is impossible said he i must be dreaming it is frightful to hear such thin	53.791772872938864
doubtless i may but	157.91147748472767
30345 m	1.0858241288757846
but i do not think so	13.21757967525234
have pity on me doctor so many dreadful things have happened to me lately that i	80.51492060073107
has anyone besides me seen madame de saintmran	95.95323076724823
has anything been sent for from a chemists that i have not examined	66.98982415165021
had madame de saintmran any enemies	66.80321660463011
not to my knowledge	197.4453629186427
would her death affect anyones interest	1453.6212628375995
it could not indeed my daughter is her only heiressvalentine alone	134.61471108638256
oh if such a thought could present itself i would stab myself to punish my heart	124.28134572017454
indeed my dear friend said m	11.86149119901156
davrigny i would not accuse anyone i speak only of an accident you understandof 	144.9423391575194
make inquiry	4481.02920474569
of whomhowof what	1743.9862137771888
may not barrois the old servant have made a mistake and have given madame de sai	46.30054898412817
for my father	30.081572731423506
but how could a dose prepared for m	191.3779993386939
noirtier poison madame de saintmran	152.9559446823228
nothing is more simple	154.39438187235083
you know poisons become remedies in certain diseases of which paralysis is one	269.4085703993696
for instance having tried every other remedy to restore movement and speech to m	275.65673023969015
noirtier i resolved to try one last means and for three months i have been givin	101.4062679099311
this quantity which is perfectly safe to administer to the paralyzed frame of m	121.30463601537794
noirtier which has become gradually accustomed to it would be sufficient to kill	113.114082892736
my dear doctor there is no communication between m	69.87599851384431
noirtiers apartment and that of madame de saintmran and barrois never entered my	75.72669910721888
in short doctor although i know you to be the most conscientious man in the worl	40.68309673893082
is there one of my brethren in whom you have equal confidence with myself	77.69655037579905
why do you ask me thatwhat do you wish	23.031366155782912
send for him i will tell him what i have seen and we will consult together and e	56.857402183572404
and you will find traces of poison	107.13737002987727
no i did not say of poison but we can prove what was the state of the body we sh	50.658232628865534
what do you propose to me davrigny said villefort in despair so soon as another 	36.80104379906149
but doctor you see me already so grievedhow can i introduce into my house so muc	188.36855812649125
let this affair be talked of it will be a triumph for them which will make them 	81.97450710267825
pardon me doctor these worldly ideas were you a priest i should not dare tell yo	115.50962798332286
doctor pray recall your words you have said nothing have you	112.81733390663233
my dear m	10.487548875575333
de villefort replied the doctor my first duty is to humanity	42.1152676898574
i would have saved madame de saintmran if science could have done it but she is 	68.30935368181481
let us bury this terrible secret in the deepest recesses of our hearts i am will	89.55743931038309
meanwhile sir watch alwayswatch carefully for perhaps the evil may not stop here	355.07642563146476
and when you have found the culprit if you find him i will say to you you are a 	27.78843064006994
i thank you doctor said villefort with indescribable joy i never had a better fr	46.09789987518957
and as if he feared doctor davrigny would recall his promise he hurried him towa	109.98852407762314
when they were gone morrel ventured out from under the trees and the moon shone 	66.61855833736836
i am manifestly protected in a most wonderful but most terrible manner said he b	152.6435185820828
as he thought thus he looked alternately at the window with red curtains and the	50.32783778699701
the light had almost disappeared from the former doubtless madame de villefort h	105.20225576815785
at the extremity of the building on the contrary he saw one of the three windows	16.87216923985708
a waxlight placed on the mantlepiece threw some of its pale rays without and a s	135.44950307687873
morrel shuddered he thought he heard a sob	71.14570637776612
it can not be wondered at that his mind generally so courageous but now disturbe	80.7807273972167
although it was impossible that valentine should see him hidden as he was he tho	31.73287956168908
this double error became an irresistible reality and by one of the incomprehensi	136.68595368058237
valentine had not seen him	18.619538792525255
her eyes raised towards heaven were watching a silvery cloud gliding over the az	59.304233946145565
her poetic and excited mind pictured it as the soul of her grandmother	121.67492967590599
meanwhile morrel had traversed the anteroom and found the staircase which being 	66.33536271437568
de villefort even would not have alarmed him	60.40203040405337
he was quite prepared for any such encounter	98.77372337454823
he would at once approach valentines father and acknowledge all begging villefor	241.64061330102462
morrel was mad	187.95135258586146
happily he did not meet anyone	51.09843994467223
now especially did he find the description valentine had given of the interior o	82.06050777517753
he turned back a door partly open enabled him to see his road and to hear the vo	78.22405265406182
he pushed the door open and entered	56.60282540279189
at the other end of the room under a white sheet which covered it lay the corpse	46.50140586781168
by its side on her knees and with her head buried in the cushion of an easychair	52.462493513559586
she had turned from the window which remained open and was praying in accents th	65.02741687458811
the moon shining through the open blinds made the lamp appear to burn paler and 	262.62692812625227
morrel could not resist this he was not exemplary for piety he was not easily im	38.499968202719764
he sighed and whispered a name and the head bathed in tears and pressed on the v	72.62438388747162
valentine perceived him without betraying the least surprise	222.15898375065697
a heart overwhelmed with one great grief is insensible to minor emotions	385.7500824161711
morrel held out his hand to her	22.239475108650968
valentine as her only apology for not having met him pointed to the corpse under	227.48503271281038
neither dared for some time to speak in that room	79.31493428893862
they hesitated to break the silence which death seemed to impose at length valen	130.13287224223797
my friend said she how came you here alas i would say you are welcome had not de	122.07359257006529
valentine said morrel with a trembling voice i had waited since halfpast eight a	101.04252401958085
what voices asked valentine	170.5552930578876
morrel shuddered as he thought of the conversation of the doctor and m	41.66542785407758
de villefort and he thought he could see through the sheet the extended hands th	72.93272419156115
your servants said he who were repeating the whole of the sorrowful story from t	62.495535330346456
but it was risking the failure of our plan to come up here love	97.55680260599212
forgive me replied morrel i will go away	11.032342902429377
no said valentine you might meet someone stay	201.3362635702914
but if anyone should come here	114.36789643227283
the young girl shook her head	15.52501912772772
no one will come said she do not fear there is our safeguard pointing to the bed	80.92707889321714
but what has become of m	23.754813121461527
dpinay replied morrel	13.499691790607512

franz arrived to sign the contract just as my dear grandmother was dying	171.30057167259054
alas said morrel with a feeling of selfish joy for he thought this death would c	56.95231812417599
but what redoubles my sorrow continued the young girl as if this feeling was to 	73.01592349681474
hark said morrel	7.0174642016771385
they both listened steps were distinctly heard in the corridor and on the stairs	88.20135838143355
it is my father who has just left his study	27.319174429025146
to accompany the doctor to the door added morrel	54.5339348607501
how do you know it is the doctor asked valentine astonished	17.202092321596602
i imagined it must be said morrel	35.09731185587565
valentine looked at the young man they heard the street door close then m	44.84303570842812
de villefort locked the garden door and returned upstairs	79.30831601120137
he stopped a moment in the anteroom as if hesitating whether to turn to his own 	35.08831756847801
de villefort passed on to his own room	33.960537028595
now said valentine you can neither go out by the front door nor by the garden	71.39253020779012
morrel looked at her with astonishment	10.708481089612793
there is but one way left you that is safe said she it is through my grandfather	90.17122969045788
she rose	472.6155559868366
come she added	157.27146440354687
where asked maximilian	38.169360023137564
to my grandfathers room	177.1074095230693
i in m	1434.7356362611536
noirtiers apartment	3767.3676973251786
can you mean it valentine	34.98831446991009
i have long wished it he is my only remaining friend and we both need his helpco	156.7080047860367
be careful valentine said morrel hesitating to comply with the young girls wishe	26.26156492458153
are you sure you are more reasonable	45.79373193437526
yes said valentine and i have but one scruplethat of leaving my dear grandmother	30.533936567524865
valentine said morrel death is in itself sacred	98.58640018196556
yes said valentine besides it will not be for long	26.088252045354448
she then crossed the corridor and led the way down a narrow staircase to m	72.751760728718
noirtiers room morrel followed her on tiptoe at the door they found the old serv	45.62408525085767
barrois said valentine shut the door and let no one come in	49.477586813674996
she passed first	453.2935619130148
noirtier seated in his chair and listening to every sound was watching the door 	86.28184371071276
there was something grave and solemn in the approach of the young girl which str	46.03296924449897
dear grandfather	607.9701178114244
said she hurriedly you know poor grandmamma died an hour since and now i have no	102.84937047778305
his expressive eyes evinced the greatest tenderness	379.2075379265738
to you alone then may i confide my sorrows and my hopes	133.57700337299235
the paralytic motioned yes	2201.4694332220743
valentine took maximilians hand	27.14099777644463
look attentively then at this gentleman	115.78872086151756
the old man fixed his scrutinizing gaze with slight astonishment on morrel	67.29570606597316
it is m	24.75655327733355
maximilian morrel said she the son of that good merchant of marseilles whom you 	67.68313764861793
yes said the old man	7.417038756883085
he brings an irreproachable name which maximilian is likely to render glorious s	145.80348915117193
the old man signified that he recollected him	52.58071485749579
well grandpapa said valentine kneeling before him and pointing to maximilian i l	62.80913213885073
the eyes of the paralytic expressed a multitude of tumultuous thoughts	58.67651749887236
you like m	377.42019641591617
maximilian morrel do you not grandpapa asked valentine	40.92180324716301
and you will protect us who are your children against the will of my father	89.7681336274366
noirtier cast an intelligent glance at morrel as if to say perhaps i may	39.07533081961177
maximilian understood him	143.57279295042966
mademoiselle said he you have a sacred duty to fulfil in your deceased grandmoth	43.120828396934726
that is it said the old mans eye	22.514618948120923
then he looked anxiously at valentine	27.38034500439303
do you fear he will not understand	25.356040046068703
oh we have so often spoken of you that he knows exactly how i talk to you	83.88911031806398
then turning to maximilian with an adorable smile although shaded by sorrowhe kn	32.538803112983956
valentine arose placed a chair for morrel requested barrois not to admit anyone 	224.25421233870944
to prove to noirtier that he was in valentines confidence and knew all their sec	72.77309866413833
but first said morrel allow me sir to tell you who i am how much i love mademois	59.25089648752677
noirtier made a sign that he would listen	24.894854147450012
it was an imposing sight to witness this old man apparently a mere useless burde	83.19322740617076
his remarkably noble and austere expression struck morrel who began his story wi	198.46082326940837

he told him his birth his position his fortune and more than once when he consul	86.66969816183888
and now said morrel when he had finished the first part of his recital now i hav	28.658795816636857
yes signified the old man	55.63246201287724
this was our resolution a cabriolet was in waiting at the gate in which i intend	80.73879082051967
de villeforts pardon	43.05680598479404
no said noirtier	4.549770880162202
we must not do so	20.861392657046
you do not sanction our project	156.45907223015408
there is another way said morrel	17.439686387902707
the old mans interrogative eye said which	162.70984725210948
i will go continued maximilian i will seek m	65.44895981202622
franz dpinayi am happy to be able to mention this in mademoiselle de villeforts 	42.44298111536851
noirtiers look continued to interrogate	350.62152154457584
you wish to know what i will do	22.789944510044702
i will find him as i told you	17.68694531539729
i will tell him the ties which bind me to mademoiselle valentine if he be a sens	26.77615056813475
noirtier watched with indescribable pleasure this noble and sincere countenance 	183.14104186050915
still when morrel had finished he shut his eyes several times which was his mann	69.42789516917287
no said morrel you disapprove of this second project as you did of the first	55.937620818375045
i do signified the old man	87.4398457956722
but what then must be done asked morrel	28.445128707836947
madame de saintmrans last request was that the marriage might not be delayed mus	54.04941288805853
i understand said morrel i am to wait	28.52571604640019
but delay may ruin our plan sir replied the young man	121.61524263789245
alone valentine has no power she will be compelled to submit	81.79637922048684
i am here almost miraculously and can scarcely hope for so good an opportunity t	139.9146242310225
believe me there are only the two plans i have proposed to you forgive my vanity	68.21434087395204
do you authorize mademoiselle valentine to intrust herself to my honor	73.40635367707812
do you prefer i should seek m	144.21831941785146
whence then will come the help we needfrom chance resumed morrel	295.49109089430067
from you	356.05301268612845
you thoroughly understand me sir pardon my eagerness for my life depends on your	149.62868269812665
will our help come from you	168.16516042353595
you are sure of it	14.48346260066464
there was so much firmness in the look which gave this answer no one could at an	132.40699444948683
oh thank you a thousand times but how unless a miracle should restore your speec	105.98404811351404
then i must wait asked the young man	30.763176516082893
but the contract the same smile returned	188.2157445850706
will you assure me it shall not be signed	37.369784767390264
yes said noirtier	3.957993441861485
the contract shall not be signed cried morrel	84.7757550054361
oh pardon me sir i can scarcely realize so great a happiness	77.18195275078801
will they not sign it	122.4305284692332
no said the paralytic	26.182460768819492
notwithstanding that assurance morrel still hesitated	358.7564333679475
this promise of an impotent old man was so strange that instead of being the res	50.43720818352462
is it not natural that the madman ignorant of his folly should attempt things be	116.53126865340079
whether noirtier understood the young mans indecision or whether he had not full	46.15585671776511
what do you wish sir asked morrel that i should renew my promise of remaining tr	33.34951940669074
shall i swear to you sir asked maximilian	14.08198426686138
yes said the paralytic with the same solemnity	24.708241931960387
morrel understood that the old man attached great importance to an oath	89.32845308723404
he extended his hand	28.503614364704685
i swear to you on my honor said he to await your decision respecting the course 	44.16875990834807
that is right said the old man	14.94779944283689
now said morrel do you wish me to retire	13.232089993007337
without seeing mademoiselle valentine	228.90120278312855
morrel made a sign that he was ready to obey	13.875131047835335
but said he first allow me to embrace you as your daughter did just now	115.07301557599452
noirtiers expression could not be understood	297.90495203518657
the young man pressed his lips on the same spot on the old mans forehead where v	23.06620059076728
then he bowed a second time and retired	48.67344016692585
he found outside the door the old servant to whom valentine had given directions	67.51066049355805
morrel was conducted along a dark passage which led to a little door opening on 	113.14256521294186

the parisians always curious always affected by funereal display looked on with 	542.8116912073938
in one of the mourningcoaches beauchamp debray and chteaurenaud were talking of 	17.641116525530677
i saw madame de saintmran only last year at marseilles when i was coming back fr	46.13849501897996
how old was she	433.89705782407196
franz assured me replied albert that she was sixtysix years old	89.07885425118661
but she has not died of old age but of grief it appears that since the death of 	73.61410917197996
but of what disease then did she die asked debray	111.41161250395778
it is said to have been a congestion of the brain or apoplexy which is the same 	45.97016861231436
it is difficult to believe that it was apoplexy said beauchamp	26.829643824215815
madame de saintmran whom i once saw was short of slender form and of a much more	124.17087128766279
at any rate said albert whatever disease or doctor may have killed her m	183.99105497875837
de villefort or rather mademoiselle valentineor still rather our friend franz in	71.37745092374058
and this fortune will be doubled at the death of the old jacobin noirtier	38.50198765937881

one thing only puzzles me namely how franz dpinay will like a grandfather who ca	245.9617577021182
but where is franz	35.86251509274023
in the first carriage with m	41.507858411802495

de villefort	1.0501193993042661
they arrived in about an hour at the cemetery the weather was mild but dull and 	57.55840540912673
among the groups which flocked towards the family vault chteaurenaud recognized 	211.06269216022255
you here said chteaurenaud passing his arms through the young captains are you a	42.87681765306707
i am no acquaintance of m	97.11476292465794
de villeforts answered morrel but i was of madame de saintmran	21.782515711750268
albert came up to them at this moment with franz	30.90620091139953
the time and place are but illsuited for an introduction	364.0112773128033
said albert but we are not superstitious	23.821862515952645

morrel hesitated for a moment he feared it would be hypocritical to accost in a 	26.909330300111563
mademoiselle de villefort is in deep sorrow is she not said debray to franz	32.23803334897263
extremely replied he she looked so pale this morning i scarcely knew her	91.54528631031678
these apparently simple words pierced morrel to the heart	239.55650775152776
this man had seen valentine and spoken to her the young and highspirited officer	64.73301804702517
he took the arm of chteaurenaud and turned towards the vault where the attendant	41.03547793013945
this is a magnificent habitation said beauchamp looking towards the mausoleum a 	44.33329112685952
you will in turn enter it my dear dpinay for you will soon be numbered as one of	99.0946107563068

but come franz take courage your wife is an heiress	192.91955945113418

i am prejudiced against beauchamp said albert drawing franz away and leaving the	84.58815191569046

the two coffins were placed on trestles previously prepared for their reception 	135.63033910734273
villefort franz and a few near relatives alone entered the sanctuary	68.41085959696183
as the religious ceremonies had all been performed at the door and there was no 	50.94779044489003
franz remained with m	155.77829035166704
de villefort at the gate of the cemetery morrel made an excuse to wait he saw fr	22.752803917359493
de villefort get into the same mourningcoach and thought this meeting forboded e	154.46256995140806
he then returned to paris and although in the same carriage with chteaurenaud an	36.90768869915587
as franz was about to take leave of m	65.35907870000821
de villefort when shall i see you again said the latter	28.866076546812
at what time you please sir replied franz	27.492168601530732
as soon as possible	12.710576650056938
i am at your command sir shall we return together	72.4272954047179
if not unpleasant to you	119.99514303354111
on the contrary i shall feel much pleasure	37.55285283383366
thus the future father and soninlaw stepped into the same carriage and morrel se	82.86940144606199
villefort and franz returned to the faubourg sainthonor	17.53559435814474
the procureur without going to see either his wife or his daughter went at once 	124.25870971169437

you know the affairs of the deceased are in perfect order and her will bequeaths	101.2919745033247

deschamps place beauveau faubourg sainthonor and you have my authority to inspec	78.25994361517749
sir replied m	32.06775993266999
dpinay it is not perhaps the moment for mademoiselle valentine who is in deep di	77.56480622098603
40028 m	1.3184501949774177
valentine will have no greater pleasure than that of fulfilling her grandmothers	152.4352014647691
in that case replied franz as i shall raise none you may make arrangements when 	73.66534072523244
then said villefort nothing further is required	163.58254014081047
the contract was to have been signed three days since we shall find it all ready	54.42721578084826
but the mourning said franz hesitating	125.14881337670032
do nt be uneasy on that score replied villefort no ceremony will be neglected in	35.09847500646905
mademoiselle de villefort may retire during the prescribed three months to her e	123.44402225311822
there after a few days if you like the civil marriage shall be celebrated withou	123.53393832241997
madame de saintmran wished her daughter should be married there	68.05543604092365
when that is over you sir can return to paris while your wife passes the time of	96.13426715718886
as you please sir said franz	13.367767429464063
then replied m	279.71892167226684
de villefort have the kindness to wait half an hour valentine shall come down in	71.4929583958853
i will send for m	73.26423972800286
deschamps we will read and sign the contract before we separate and this evening	138.69095542085245
sir said franz i have one request to make	15.38903823011775
what is it	4.9766409886744825
i wish albert de morcerf and raoul de chteaurenaud to be present at this signatu	31.427201182483113
half an hour will suffice to apprise them will you go for them yourself or shall	96.53224983297709
i prefer going sir	1666.8003633714613
i shall expect you then in half an hour baron and valentine will be ready	42.33867938914658
franz bowed and left the room	13.82195972288717
scarcely had the door closed when m	105.86272741306266
de villefort sent to tell valentine to be ready in the drawingroom in half an ho	42.61139419744832
dpinay and his witnesses	289.18181468019293
the news caused a great sensation throughout the house madame de villefort would	66.23759962943925
she looked around for help and would have gone down to her grandfathers room but	85.8717676937109
de villefort who took her arm and led her into the drawingroom	24.400489772159048
in the anteroom valentine met barrois and looked despairingly at the old servant	30.139513719817447
a moment later madame de villefort entered the drawingroom with her little edwar	19.75966182640609
it was evident that she had shared the grief of the family for she was pale and 	22.678882649048045
she sat down took edward on her knees and from time to time pressed this child o	70.35225004936828
two carriages were soon heard to enter the courtyard	65.34128554349834
one was the notarys the other that of franz and his friends	47.13930782328971
in a moment the whole party was assembled	26.29697106609574
valentine was so pale one might trace the blue veins from her temples round her 	136.13092875960282
franz was deeply affected	128.46912099667463
chteaurenaud and albert looked at each other with amazement the ceremony which w	13.072457374798251
madame de villefort had placed herself in the shadow behind a velvet curtain and	48.36274666025252
de villefort was as usual unmoved	38.79773667362086
the notary after having according to the customary method arranged the papers on	181.57282599695756
are you m	45.85593074608944
franz de quesnel baron dpinay asked he although he knew it perfectly	88.88117772417061
yes sir replied franz	7.02758031919277
the notary bowed	131.66162642184875
i have then to inform you sir at the request of m	44.04539741424201
de villefort that your projected marriage with mademoiselle de villefort has cha	57.100570611161174
noirtier towards his grandchild and that he disinherits her entirely of the fort	100.51205320948307
let me hasten to add continued he that the testator having only the right to ali	155.36257599775521

my family has sought consideration in this alliance with m	301.3858054138371
de villefort all i seek is happiness	318.42568209553576
valentine imperceptibly thanked him while two silent tears rolled down her cheek	510.90401551386685
besides sir said villefort addressing himself to his future soninlaw excepting t	47.414607169029615
noirtiers weakness of mind sufficiently explains it	957.821747732345
it is not because mademoiselle valentine is going to marry you that he is angry 	28.088628608240487
old age is selfish sir and mademoiselle de villefort has been a faithful compani	34.77802492612871
noirtier which she can not be when she becomes the baroness dpinay	236.93940466261944

noirtier has even forgotten the name of his intended grandson	82.97351033501225
de villefort had scarcely said this when the door opened and barrois appeared	25.980999052095186
gentlemen said he in a tone strangely firm for a servant speaking to his masters	63.07907843518353
noirtier de villefort wishes to speak immediately to m	64.41365479621756
franz de quesnel baron dpinay	54.21764819066092
he as well as the notary that there might be no mistake in the person gave all h	76.89520079576324
villefort started madame de villefort let her son slip from her knees valentine 	63.8244910912187
albert and chteaurenaud exchanged a second look more full of amazement than the 	63.6858025911978
the notary looked at villefort	22.70360099889618
it is impossible said the procureur	16.633548215388085
dpinay can not leave the drawingroom at present	72.54713083421827
it is at this moment replied barrois with the same firmness that m	15.964334365834146
noirtier my master wishes to speak on important subjects to m	135.0748986797855
franz dpinay	255.19682313031748
grandpapa noirtier can speak now then said edward with his habitual quickness	55.50024652397609
however his remark did not make madame de villefort even smile so much was every	85.34098302350887

nortier gives notice to these gentlemen replied barrois that he will give orders	117.6567214042175
astonishment was at its height	155.19435136025987
something like a smile was perceptible on madame de villeforts countenance	70.9704290502741
valentine instinctively raised her eyes as if to thank heaven	138.78304311687634
pray go valentine said m	71.2195992673988
de villefort and see what this new fancy of your grandfathers is	80.54905877371989
valentine rose quickly and was hastening joyfully towards the door when m	78.23819068269857
de villefort altered his intention	52.99244088880653
stop said he i will go with you	15.064601887222596

i would not lose this opportunity of proving to m	76.51419303624627
noirtier how wrong it would be of him to encourage feelings of dislike to me whi	94.86189021929714
and without listening to villefort he arose and followed valentine who was runni	49.298312562604764
de villefort followed them	47.23940632651467

noirtier was prepared to receive them dressed in black and installed in his armc	46.498734025986636
when the three persons he expected had entered he looked at the door which his v	52.427820200736384
listen whispered villefort to valentine who could not conceal her joy if m	44.16900211403065
noirtier wishes to communicate anything which would delay your marriage i forbid	363.9699690203092
valentine blushed but did not answer	48.33525405057507
villefort approached noirtier	61.627784965911474
here is m	27.04691875601192
franz dpinay said he you requested to see him	86.7872714443351
we have all wished for this interview and i trust it will convince you how illfo	57.1563601236878
noirtier answered only by a look which made villeforts blood run cold	198.63521474293873
he motioned to valentine to approach	68.17323896629365
in a moment thanks to her habit of conversing with her grandfather she understoo	106.52561851686919
then his eye was fixed on the drawer of a small chest between the windows	33.2751955351029
she opened the drawer and found a key and understanding that was what he wanted 	75.73056290131473
shall i open the secretaire asked valentine	62.7921529384387
yes said the old man	7.417731986335112
and the drawers	355.14229474382137
those at the side	108.21373046447577
the middle one	543.9750953878797
valentine opened it and drew out a bundle of papers	28.87048149660535
is that what you wish for asked she	64.80266081199476
she took successively all the other papers out till the drawer was empty	123.71007361988713
but there are no more said she	67.93573101737154
noirtiers eye was fixed on the dictionary	35.61235515895592
yes i understand grandfather said the young girl	34.78402865483645
40036 m	1.1319825626361348
she pointed to each letter of the alphabet	87.39015999290505
at the letter s the old man stopped her	90.97309927050289
she opened and found the word secret	171.18968277438788
ah is there a secret spring said valentine	90.22770241873941
yes said noirtier	4.018121652326957
and who knows it noirtier looked at the door where the servant had gone out	39.10535009824068
barrois said she	40.03467297505941
shall i call him	21.38088158784294
valentine went to the door and called barrois	18.340277156707945
villeforts impatience during this scene made the perspiration roll from his fore	134.048471962668
the old servant came	111.42186613873191
barrois said valentine my grandfather has told me to open that drawer in the sec	27.320412002818113
barrois looked at the old man	7.719113323295081
obey said noirtiers intelligent eye	327.1928508784615
barrois touched a spring the false bottom came out and they saw a bundle of pape	79.09878373199183

franz dpinay	309.92062120810095
franz astonished advanced a step	506.8418414525303
to me sir said he	9.82707165708103
franz took them from barrois and casting a glance at the cover read	61.30874249848817
to be given after my death to general durand who shall bequeath the packet to hi	131.28960961201253
well sir asked franz what do you wish me to do with this paper	19.129688370494534
to preserve it sealed up as it is doubtless said the procureur	86.16565362203121
no replied noirtier eagerly	26.10549937335767
do you wish him to read it said valentine	21.54509092251822
yes replied the old man	7.512943339568207
you understand baron my grandfather wishes you to read this paper said valentine	94.18338067686233
then let us sit down said villefort impatiently for it will take some time	20.895341181286557
sit down said the old man	6.136014133006119
villefort took a chair but valentine remained standing by her fathers side and f	51.17189416461598
read said the old man	12.44511542804885
franz untied it and in the midst of the most profound silence read	51.37293468224695
40038 m	1.4244403759078148
extract of the report of a meeting of the bonapartist club in the rue saintjacqu	14.86126088878211
franz stopped	274.1036493450776
february 5th 1815 said he it is the day my father was murdered	138.59384005966126
valentine and villefort were dumb the eye of the old man alone seemed to say cle	35.20168833932015
but it was on leaving this club said he my father disappeared	64.00933979172494
noirtiers eye continued to say read	335.2765492314841
he resumed	635.8745873646953
the undersigned louisjacques beaurepaire lieutenantcolonel of artillery tienne d	420.9739973707979
had just granted to him with his estate of pinay	67.71341727699082

a note was in consequence addressed to general de quesnel begging him to be pres	64.61385735072264
the note indicated neither the street nor the number of the house where the meet	237.0385101698145
the meetings were always held from that time till midnight	580.8729126066819
at nine oclock the president of the club presented himself the general was ready	42.776008322081225
general de quesnel accepted the condition and promised on his honor not to seek 	84.55621280606287
the generals carriage was ready but the president told him it was impossible for	81.30691184717652
what must be done then asked the general	28.99942358161347
i have my carriage here said the president	35.950365593560456
have you then so much confidence in your servant that you can intrust him with a	57.95484943771054
our coachman is a member of the club said the president we shall be driven by a 	26.592866052375115
then we run another risk said the general laughing that of being upset	145.7840930999253
we insert this joke to prove that the general was not in the least compelled to 	81.22022924616512
when they were seated in the carriage the president reminded the general of his 	39.25571790221727
on the road the president thought he saw the general make an attempt to remove t	73.87950077759098
sure enough said the general	52.76037679150361
the carriage stopped at an alley leading out of the rue saintjacques	41.27385088113818
the general alighted leaning on the arm of the president of whose dignity he was	74.30547403083385
the deliberations had already begun	215.40962060134987
the members apprised of the sort of presentation which was to be made that eveni	57.431689747915264
when in the middle of the room the general was invited to remove his bandage he 	39.8212352919871
they questioned him as to his sentiments but he contented himself with answering	77.01904982619483
franz interrupted himself by saying my father was a royalist they need not have 	165.8188803617024
and hence said villefort arose my affection for your father my dear m	112.90866181081634
opinions held in common are a ready bond of union	317.942447665292
read again said the old man	20.672711679220807
franz continued	151.98542642263732
the president then sought to make him speak more explicitly but m	141.4259847863467
de quesnel replied that he wished first to know what they wanted with him	66.27424784071488
he was then informed of the contents of the letter from the island of elba in wh	21.7872421788262

when the reading was finished he remained silent with knitted brows	143.23192094268705
well asked the president what do you say to this letter general	33.799034392458196
i say that it is too soon after declaring myself for louis xviii	109.10771503732299
to break my vow in behalf of the exemperor	103.81273129907198
this answer was too clear to permit of any mistake as to his sentiments	101.66660245549016
general said the president we acknowledge no king louis xviii	98.34867735279809
or an exemperor but his majesty the emperor and king driven from france which is	110.13862372350908
excuse me gentlemen said the general you may not acknowledge louis xviii	38.311515723029835
but i do as he has made me a baron and a fieldmarshal and i shall never forget t	30.08053280855401
sir said the president rising with gravity be careful what you say your words cl	43.56078354801593
now we discover our error a title and promotion attach you to the government we 	237.12917657838608
we will not constrain you to help us we enroll no one against his conscience but	83.88327031038646
you would call acting generously knowing your conspiracy and not informing again	1054.7279154917076
you see i am more candid than you	34.712581931072016
ah my father said franz interrupting himself	19.913627472321473
i understand now why they murdered him	209.210789148759
valentine could not help casting one glance towards the young man whose filial e	92.10517208304611
villefort walked to and fro behind them	126.00893601173718
noirtier watched the expression of each one and preserved his dignified and comm	82.88394431922642
franz returned to the manuscript and continued	51.87671009108442
sir said the president you have been invited to join this assemblyyou were not f	27.19865657774796
when you complied with this twofold request you well knew we did not wish to sec	121.54909328380592
or we should not take so much care to avoid the vigilance of the police	69.58652046301326
it would be conceding too much to allow you to put on a mask to aid you in the d	47.72120064971676
no no you must first say if you declare yourself for the king of a day who now r	74.9614993620974
i am a royalist replied the general i have taken the oath of allegiance to louis	50.69745254922268
and i will adhere to it	56.93306707862953
these words were followed by a general murmur and it was evident that several of	38.30719550084631
the president again arose and having imposed silence saidsir you are too serious	383.0707799500327

the general looked around him with slight uneasiness however he did not yield bu	61.87651261924419
then you must die replied the president calmly	66.17969888833797
dpinay became very pale he looked round him a second time several members of the	74.0568774507159
general said the president do not alarm yourself you are among men of honor who 	44.28273253081981
a significant silence followed these words and as the general did not replyclose	51.486405230092444
40042 m	1.253698952647084
the same deadly silence succeeded these words	263.0189407159244
then the general advanced and making a violent effort to control his feelingsi h	34.743275086027204
general said the chief of the assembly one man may insult fiftyit is the privile	79.27738761308812
but he does wrong to use his privilege	147.8279953251539
follow my advice swear and do not insult	119.36796043377107
the general again daunted by the superiority of the chief hesitated a moment the	87.70546757325235
it is thisi swear by my honor not to reveal to anyone what i have seen and heard	80.14715662622851
the general appeared to be affected by a nervous tremor which prevented his answ	55.59644915923248
now am i at liberty to retire said the general	52.36080182527793
the president rose appointed three members to accompany him and got into the car	112.71764112888364
one of those three members was the coachman who had driven them there	64.52438465841654
the other members silently dispersed	467.1815897363469
where do you wish to be taken asked the president	19.589817544613357
anywhere out of your presence replied m	82.90074293273678

dpinay went onyou are still as brave in your carriage as in your assembly becaus	149.30710425497034
the president stopped the coach	160.47533564845216
they were at that part of the quai des ormes where the steps lead down to the ri	36.28852997899816
why do you stop here asked dpinay	162.53010202485137
because sir said the president you have insulted a man and that man will not go 	29.45034687530338

now if you please remove your bandage	86.34868482769821
the general tore the handkerchief from his eyes	102.06879717422389
at last said he i shall know with whom i have to do	44.28338712088032
they opened the door and the four men alighted	28.646588222751276
franz again interrupted himself and wiped the cold drops from his brow there was	111.43754061651998
valentine clasped her hands as if in prayer	67.60279125282216

the general was stout and tall the president offered him the side of the railing	94.31123671787508
the two witnesses followed	185.59369640028427
it was a dark night	30.39373633475379

the witnesses thought he was dead but his adversary who knew he had not struck h	71.84786624758276
the circumstance irritated instead of calming the general and he rushed on his a	218.15602418613062
but his opponent did not allow his guard to be broken	68.28326814086454
he received him on his sword and three times the general drew back on finding hi	84.4820170965326
at the third he fell again	123.80945193357988
they thought he slipped as at first and the witnesses seeing he did not move app	103.73172852400386
the general who had almost fainted revived	248.096382637938
ah said he they have sent some fencingmaster to fight with me	41.796401983050266
the president without answering approached the witness who held the lantern and 	226.08657198955353
still he had not even uttered a sigh	48.92804838430572
general dpinay died five minutes after	276.1768158991973
franz read these last words in a voice so choked that they were hardly audible a	75.12907755376604

noirtier looked at the dictionary	13.483807807755255
franz took it with a nervous trembling and repeated the letters of the alphabet 	53.367983089174686
at that letter the old man signified yes	87.30127957320566

the young mans finger glided over the words but at each one noirtier answered by	168.793074498347

they are certainly less particular with a foreigner than with a frenchman	129.30445534182766
andrea had then in a fortnight attained a very fair position	191.2009531127412
he was called count he was said to possess 50000 livres per annum and his father	64.72132046998631
a learned man before whom the last circumstance was mentioned as a fact declared	190.49594876964542
such was the state of society in paris at the period we bring before our readers	61.48445801324585
danglars a visit	780.8761848027372
danglars was out but the count was asked to go and see the baroness and he accep	28.948995268498695
it was never without a nervous shudder since the dinner at auteuil and the event	92.85013909775671
if he did not come the painful sensation became most intense if on the contrary 	74.00869079244872
it appeared impossible to the baroness that a man of such delightfully pleasing 	55.372780917576954
40048 m	1.1406834206292393
when monte cristo entered the boudoir to which we have already once introduced o	54.29912040633871
cavalcanti his presence soon produced its usual effect and it was with smiles th	187.47033950971897
the latter took in the whole scene at a glance	80.81759873401629
the baroness was partially reclining on a sofa eugnie sat near her and cavalcant	79.09950036278393
cavalcanti dressed in black like one of goethes heroes with varnished shoes and 	89.45193643657853
this movement was accompanied by killing glances at mademoiselle danglars and by	76.98247986829655
mademoiselle danglars was still the samecold beautiful and satirical	76.56601901090187
not one of these glances nor one sigh was lost on her they might have been said 	189.38898548676437
eugnie bowed coldly to the count and availed herself of the first moment when th	47.776095086233475

it was then especially while conversing with madame danglars and apparently abso	118.92561013934011
andrea cavalcantis solicitude his manner of listening to the music at the door h	70.39597480825311
the banker soon returned	215.16150070231635
his first look was certainly directed towards monte cristo but the second was fo	61.80470958774253
as for his wife he bowed to her as some husbands do to their wives but in a way 	94.3308461567324
have not the ladies invited you to join them at the piano said danglars to andre	42.29537669375178
alas no sir replied andrea with a sigh still more remarkable than the former one	43.060450406609995
danglars immediately advanced towards the door and opened it	45.55701961665699
40050 m	1.1629610027758954
the two young ladies were seen seated on the same chair at the piano accompanyin	34.71707615756221
mademoiselle darmilly whom they then perceived through the open doorway formed w	146.59661904167513
she was somewhat beautiful and exquisitely formeda little fairylike figure with 	150.53662490814705
she was said to have a weak chest and like antonia in the cremona violin she wou	91.87365816476557
monte cristo cast one rapid and curious glance round this sanctum it was the fir	105.82870984364402
well said the banker to his daughter are we then all to be excluded	63.05989130376131
he then led the young man into the study and either by chance or manuvre the doo	53.199010311886326
the count soon heard andreas voice singing a corsican song accompanied by the pi	167.09479195037682
while the count smiled at hearing this song which made him lose sight of andrea 	61.30637456700751
the praise was well deserved for had not the count heard it from the baroness or	158.63773569912448
hem thought monte cristo he begins to conceal his losses a month since he boaste	63.108622388112146
then aloudoh madame m	331.5806787362796
danglars is so skilful he will soon regain at the bourse what he loses elsewhere	144.17637663941798
i see that you participate in a prevalent error said madame danglars	55.34801969158094
what is it said monte cristo	5.171004699832837
that m	190.43301013522148
danglars speculates whereas he never does	1153.1190123929975
truly madame i recollect m	226.12225875013743
debray told meapropos what has become of him i have seen nothing of him the last	67.09784735263744
nor i said madame danglars but you began a sentence sir and did not finish	84.72184623000543
debray had told you	51.91365519778901
ah yes he told me it was you who sacrificed to the demon of speculation	48.84304686581674
i was once very fond of it but i do not indulge now	58.84889790741946
then you are wrong madame	39.18211998932604
fortune is precarious and if i were a woman and fate had made me a bankers wife 	102.22743915820772
well i would secure for myself a fortune independent of him even if i acquired i	134.62414724364686
madame danglars blushed in spite of all her efforts	55.03893836424674

i have nonenor have i ever possessed any but really we have talked long enough o	149.80466019170956
what has happened said the count simulating total ignorance	101.01087417218632
you know the marquis of saintmran died a few days after he had set out on his jo	30.776021929161278
yes said monte cristo i have heard that but as claudius said to hamlet it is a l	24.513529443152912
but that is not all	22.245727403837115
not all	272.27419165133574
no they were going to marry their daughter	70.26089501968961
to m	76.25751607123149
franz dpinay	303.08956577894446
is it broken off	221.4455034473219
yesterday morning it appears franz declined the honor	150.1596707592837
indeed and is the reason known	153.9568844580949
how extraordinary and how does m	191.9656767952045
de villefort bear it	61.5329105532532
as usual	264.00770256777207
like a philosopher	57.83837446430006
danglars returned at this moment alone	45.84960103050202
well said the baroness do you leave m	31.270587982566898
cavalcanti with your daughter	304.07073665916386
and mademoiselle darmilly said the banker do you consider her no one then turnin	48.832683835383335
i will not answer for it said monte cristo	10.091049528669014
his father was introduced to me as a marquis so he ought to be a count but i do 	62.452459102969385
why said the banker	31.928935227167635
if he is a prince he is wrong not to maintain his rank i do not like anyone to d	45.287603533695126
oh you are a thorough democrat said monte cristo smiling	17.723028101480757
but do you see to what you are exposing yourself said the baroness	38.760781630042764
if perchance m	1245.6120299664756
de morcerf came he would find m	133.77855722375148
cavalcanti in that room where he the betrothed of eugnie has never been admitted	81.89523490862534
you may well say perchance replied the banker for he comes so seldom it would se	74.68249843444956
but should he come and find that young man with your daughter he might be disple	67.52051183925462
he you are mistaken	118.849248787382
albert would not do us the honor to be jealous he does not like eugnie sufficien	36.84854204956982
besides i care not for his displeasure	197.35518850074578
still situated as we are	111.96676812587724
yes do you know how we are situated at his mothers ball he danced once with eugn	110.25075457828596
cavalcanti three times and he took no notice of it	68.28346350114121
the valet announced the vicomte albert de morcerf	53.36977719186708
the baroness rose hastily and was going into the study when danglars stopped her	85.45402367801883
let her alone said he	82.16532432944923
she looked at him in amazement	19.548451948781224
monte cristo appeared to be unconscious of what passed	77.7911559593717
albert entered looking very handsome and in high spirits	136.63401752754456
he bowed politely to the baroness familiarly to danglars and affectionately to m	51.91965847712644
then turning to the baroness may i ask how mademoiselle danglars is said he	60.243482600922995
she is quite well replied danglars quickly she is at the piano with m	33.96406742690613
albert retained his calm and indifferent manner he might feel perhaps annoyed bu	261.506011449649
cavalcanti has a fine tenor voice said he and mademoiselle eugnie a splendid sop	65.59702410434096
the concert must be a delightful one	214.14134255814923
they suit each other remarkably well said danglars	140.38241995771403
albert appeared not to notice this remark which was however so rude that madame 	87.6795422456424
i too said the young man am a musicianat least my masters used to tell me so but	57.64932335476087
danglars smiled and seemed to say it is of no consequence	43.338516954363605
then hoping doubtless to effect his purpose he saidthe prince and my daughter we	275.1508750848896
you were not of the party m	70.39030214342196
de morcerf	1.048759339172622
what prince asked albert	118.62741620138017
prince cavalcanti said danglars who persisted in giving the young man that title	47.03842329416178
pardon me said albert i was not aware that he was a prince	13.395437955682223
and prince cavalcanti sang with mademoiselle eugnie yesterday it must have been 	136.7739056596306
i regret not having heard them	258.80197014182363
but i was unable to accept your invitation having promised to accompany my mothe	78.05303225749604
this was followed by rather an awkward silence	167.02341660173525
may i also be allowed said morcerf to pay my respects to mademoiselle danglars	53.042344913817615
wait a moment said the banker stopping the young man do you hear that delightful	45.76651034558269
bravo bravi brava the banker was enthusiastic in his applause	154.59896274980596
40054 m	1.3385937182073657
indeed said albert it is exquisite it is impossible to understand the music of h	18.345778791548547
you said prince did you not but he can easily become one if he is not already it	131.32022642215287
but to return to the charming musiciansyou should give us a treat danglars witho	77.83315737806252
ask them to sing one more song it is so delightful to hear music in the distance	112.3340511482679
danglars was quite annoyed by the young mans indifference	63.91134758892835
he took monte cristo aside	105.56421078289114
what do you think of our lover said he	21.856302973516044
he appears cool	2854.5944593052113
but then your word is given	91.76617055108461
yes doubtless i have promised to give my daughter to a man who loves her but not	48.452815051292774
see him there cold as marble and proud like his father	157.49712973453163
if he were rich if he had cavalcantis fortune that might be pardoned	73.5293517099141
ma foi i have nt consulted my daughter but if she has good taste	83.58525096717133
oh said monte cristo my fondness may blind me but i assure you i consider morcer	43.49441760225863
hem said danglars	5.424204423946007
why do you doubt	17.643875857586263
the pastthat obscurity on the past	650.4918985519803
but that does not affect the son	56.941510671086164
very true	33.55629921218482
now i beg of you do nt go off your head	34.67763291057709
its a month now that you have been thinking of this marriage and you must see th	38.185971656213795
but i do	13.897319583111482
have you made inquiry	192.5166912023106
is there any need of that does not his appearance speak for him and he is very r	54.75194331454225
i am not so sure of that	14.809824882109623
and yet you said he had money	86.3167806704797
fifty thousand livresa mere trifle	224.2055632190752
he is well educated	106.74400820120934
hem said monte cristo in his turn	8.659570973720307
he is a musician	35.457855827727755
so are all italians	344.4015658313229
come count you do not do that young man justice	103.05427730908302
well i acknowledge it annoys me knowing your connection with the morcerf family 	127.23933146927254
danglars burst out laughing	946.3585889634163
what a puritan you are said he that happens every day	87.85255055325503
but you can not break it off in this way the morcerfs are depending on this unio	42.551100526357864
then let them explain themselves you should give the father a hint you are so in	152.26963829589172
iwhere the devil did you find out that	55.21895521193044
at their ball it was apparent enough	239.00906135779536
why did not the countess the proud mercds the disdainful catalane who will scarc	65.54809057569128
ah baron baron said albert you are not listeningwhat barbarism in a megalomaniac	54.181905293380396
oh do nt worry about me sir mocker said danglars then turning to monte cristo he	23.910811277541
but will you undertake to speak to the father	42.76362901922104
willingly if you wish it	26.349060986550217
but let it be done explicitly and positively	154.7688297777063
if he demands my daughter let him fix the daydeclare his conditions in short let	170.06502734175484
you understandno more delay	1838.4995135734175
yes sir i will give my attention to the subject	24.292390071757456
i do not say that i await with pleasure his decision but i do await it	59.98509914388763
a banker must you know be a slave to his promise	138.44192398647274
and danglars sighed as m	121.63432306385866
cavalcanti had done half an hour before	65.63469495161468
bravi bravo brava cried morcerf parodying the banker as the selection came to an	80.70384106307235
danglars began to look suspiciously at morcerf when someone came and whispered a	63.39306419193168
i shall soon return said the banker to monte cristo wait for me	49.973938824895654
i shall perhaps have something to say to you	33.788342696213896
and he went out	19.88898277189091
the baroness took advantage of her husbands absence to push open the door of her	65.14327091120506
andrea who was sitting before the piano with mademoiselle eugnie started up like	83.60414510870294
albert bowed with a smile to mademoiselle danglars who did not appear in the lea	19.360735285995627
cavalcanti was evidently embarrassed he bowed to morcerf who replied with the mo	71.82861485762677
then albert launched out in praise of mademoiselle danglars voice and on his reg	87.66925786835868
cavalcanti being left alone turned to monte cristo	109.42011298564515
come said madame danglars leave music and compliments and let us go and take tea	60.149821466222534
come louise said mademoiselle danglars to her friend	32.416390022209285
they passed into the next drawingroom where tea was prepared	113.46992444100952
just as they were beginning in the english fashion to leave the spoons in their 	60.389531658671984
monte cristo observed it particularly and by a look asked the banker for an expl	70.55099172988812
i have just received my courier from greece said danglars	37.18377027380157
ah yes said the count that was the reason of your running away from us	48.64397327294498
how is king otho getting on asked albert in the most sprightly tone	73.64482978014615
danglars cast another suspicious look towards him without answering and monte cr	108.02076269365206
we shall go together shall we not said albert to the count	27.545752528667474
if you like replied the latter	43.518461621112074
albert could not understand the bankers look and turning to monte cristo who und	32.93564392621884
yes said the count but did you think there was anything particular in his look	63.22820290650982
indeed i did and what does he mean by his news from greece	126.08839440573429
how can i tell you	9.303521020782275
because i imagine you have correspondents in that country	76.83846201401921
monte cristo smiled significantly	78.30611866911504
stop said albert here he comes	34.81202932944458
i shall compliment mademoiselle danglars on her cameo while the father talks to 	161.66248415740645
if you compliment her at all let it be on her voice at least said monte cristo	65.49628899668937
no everyone would do that	255.76549223569145
my dear viscount you are dreadfully impertinent	55.43502322502602
albert advanced towards eugnie smiling	221.6976984977628
meanwhile danglars stooping to monte cristos ear your advice was excellent said 	274.82516185188797
indeed said monte cristo	5.288963831138126
yes i will tell you all but take away the young man i can not endure his presenc	36.37414579929075
he is going with me	20.275117742758614
shall i send the father to you	28.860020838223342
very well	2.6188576622597015
the count made a sign to albert and they bowed to the ladies and took their leav	22.421688874766744
cavalcanti remained master of the field	101.56024800525527
chapter 77	2898.6616620412465
scarcely had the counts horses cleared the angle of the boulevard when albert tu	41.39403969949116
well said he i will ask you the same question which charles ix	26.070295087755632
put to catherine de medici after the massacre of saint bartholomew how have i pl	30.528797420470465
to what do you allude asked monte cristo	20.095610221483998
to the installation of my rival at m	51.40399341151248
what rival	13812.615125160368
ma foi what rival why your protg m	294.2832255856678
andrea cavalcanti	14.696837319614149
ah no joking viscount if you please i do not patronize m	98.72974272024099
andreaat least not as concerns m	617.0011994242406
and you would be to blame for not assisting him if the young man really needed y	71.1553077769362
what do you think he is paying his addresses	29.647267556885758
i am certain of it his languishing looks and modulated tones when addressing mad	156.70210168544878
he aspires to the hand of the proud eugnie	81.00340539309062
what does that signify so long as they favor your suit	161.76619899637163
but it is not the case my dear count on the contrary	11.61943534950259
i am repulsed on all sides	59.26739855410492
it is so indeed mademoiselle eugnie scarcely answers me and mademoiselle darmill	87.27360101327838
but the father has the greatest regard possible for you said monte cristo	69.97976568434972

you are mistaken my dear viscount	14.859786990382329
prove it to me	10.318701314719178
do you wish me to do so	8.08521903593132
well i am charged with the commission of endeavoring to induce the comte de morc	28.94808422169664
by whom are you charged	45.825416230295396
by the baron himself	100.36004517225895
oh said albert with all the cajolery of which he was capable	26.530083207621903
you surely will not do that my dear count	78.23886220935759
certainly i shall albert as i have promised to do it	36.05318717878265
well said albert with a sigh it seems you are determined to marry me	19.335631526390852
i am determined to try and be on good terms with everybody at all events said mo	52.02293678580516
but apropos of debray how is it that i have not seen him lately at the barons ho	45.38993802369344
there has been a misunderstanding	44.097882359352596
what with the baroness	189.45582498071548
no with the baron	185.44914703631267
has he perceived anything	252.96286580588358
ah that is a good joke	23.399401328275875
do you think he suspects said monte cristo with charming artlessness	40.31383105796515
where have you come from my dear count said albert	17.625830245562742
from congo if you will	17.653583217380994
it must be farther off than even that	166.999684682443
but what do i know of your parisian husbands	38.48973485787792
oh my dear count husbands are pretty much the same everywhere an individual husb	87.91100844180036
but then what can have led to the quarrel between danglars and debray they seeme	49.17884083399082
ah now you are trying to penetrate into the mysteries of isis in which i am not 	43.54537389527052
when m	274.33299796246484
andrea cavalcanti has become one of the family you can ask him that question	60.52467817634437
the carriage stopped	155.06260897507582
here we are said monte cristo it is only halfpast ten oclock come in	33.93510633717644
certainly i will	21.352852983586267
my carriage shall take you back	90.85838987975163
no thank you i gave orders for my coup to follow me	81.02909537934597
there it is then said monte cristo as he stepped out of the carriage	17.750866403089994
they both went into the house the drawingroom was lighted upthey went in there	111.50339750583917
you will make tea for us baptistin said the count	24.221076794388075
baptistin left the room without waiting to answer and in two seconds reappeared 	80.4661001403865
really my dear count said morcerf what i admire in you is not so much your riche	29.107031751127323
what you say is perhaps true they know my habits	205.05318145333928
for instance you shall see how do you wish to occupy yourself during teatime	72.68393726988836
ma foi i should like to smoke	40.073396705773035
monte cristo took the gong and struck it once	56.82875231394922
in about the space of a second a private door opened and ali appeared bringing t	54.535417097865306
it is quite wonderful said albert	18.23585031107843
oh no it is as simple as possible replied monte cristo	17.370403320873674
ali knows i generally smoke while i am taking my tea or coffee he has heard that	212.006811609307
certainly you give a most commonplace air to your explanation but it is not the 	64.46174143603756
ma foi my dear viscount you are fated to hear music this evening you have only e	29.96210979561077
haydewhat an adorable name are there then really women who bear the name of hayd	159.81540526047624
certainly there are	49.4079664450692
hayde is a very uncommon name in france but is common enough in albania and epir	42.531109482213125
oh that is charming said albert how i should like to hear my countrywomen called	56.567020563517836
hush said the count do not joke in so loud a tone hayde may hear you perhaps	56.391266686895634
and you think she would be angry	47.269509988034194
no certainly not said the count with a haughty expression	29.433107095018148
she is very amiable then is she not said albert	40.63882274620232
it is not to be called amiability it is her duty a slave does not dictate to a m	38.173610092637446
come you are joking yourself now	123.54100719331102
are there any more slaves to be had who bear this beautiful name	186.93777979699004
really count you do nothing and have nothing like other people	360.4363112463867
the slave of the count of monte cristo why it is a rank of itself in france and 	34.858805395534894
a hundred thousand francs the poor girl originally possessed much more than that	40.04373221423239
she must be a princess then	65.95174636289207
you are right and she is one of the greatest in her country too	41.024110937945416
i thought so	87.42375317362773
but how did it happen that such a great princess became a slave	85.06657952708164
how was it that dionysius the tyrant became a schoolmaster the fortune of war my	92.01189111775939
and is her name a secret	79.97627911560734
as regards the generality of mankind it is but not for you my dear viscount who 	71.07714325509312
certainly on my word of honor	17.27125996105173
you know the history of the pasha of yanina do you not	18.4387286044065
of ali tepelini13 oh yes it was in his service that my father made his fortune	40.504020211723315
true i had forgotten that	76.58584624859644
40062 m	1.3354065411534
well what is hayde to ali tepelini	23.086078522138497
merely his daughter	193.1646876564088
what the daughter of ali pasha	49.01994091875884
of ali pasha and the beautiful vasiliki	52.24688651831841
and your slave	579.1217089829421
ma foi yes	11.201733621141017
but how did she become so	46.59339521276716
why simply from the circumstance of my having bought her one day as i was passin	121.38442713352855
wonderful really my dear count you seem to throw a sort of magic influence over 	69.36889261291839
now i am perhaps going to make an imprudent and thoughtless request but	87.79400594683312
say on	356.0581061017615
but since you go out with hayde and sometimes even take her to the opera	72.37633816501226
i think i may venture to ask you this favor	50.37888379409266
you may venture to ask me anything	75.99039398840738
well then my dear count present me to your princess	59.74195186166498
i will do so but on two conditions	80.11074396357128
i accept them at once	56.86065568330449
the first is that you will never tell anyone that i have granted the interview	54.97769130067457
very well said albert extending his hand i swear i will not	12.983706073154655
the second is that you will not tell her that your father ever served hers	108.95221435395504
i give you my oath that i will not	27.239793947880987
enough viscount you will remember those two vows will you not but i know you to 	122.89581871806499
the count again struck the gong	111.12208515855173
ali reappeared	1858.0869984844078
tell hayde said he that i will take coffee with her and give her to understand t	55.87278935001811
ali bowed and left the room	16.22505224012076
now understand me said the count no direct questions my dear morcerf if you wish	58.23533060641188
ali reappeared for the third time and drew back the tapestried hanging which con	43.24806595819552
let us go in said monte cristo	7.529349146036139
albert passed his hand through his hair and curled his moustache then having sat	84.07367972164012
ali was stationed as a kind of advanced guard and the door was kept by the three	80.31878222303607
hayde was awaiting her visitors in the first room of her apartments which was th	43.7306083530952
her large eyes were dilated with surprise and expectation for it was the first t	35.70047805763623
she was sitting on a sofa placed in an angle of the room with her legs crossed u	27.06374809471287
near her was the instrument on which she had just been playing it was elegantly 	75.19373246016838
on perceiving monte cristo she arose and welcomed him with a smile peculiar to h	26.824552545641083
monte cristo advanced towards her and extended his hand which she as usual raise	87.9413212739473
40064 m	1.1595635417581995
albert had proceeded no farther than the door where he remained rooted to the sp	71.52142963030805
whom do you bring asked the young girl in romaic of monte cristo is it a friend 	21.56626473002081
a friend said monte cristo in the same language	15.845972591284033
what is his name	10.272889158644954
count albert it is the same man whom i rescued from the hands of the banditti at	36.37816995615636
in what language would you like me to converse with him	47.4024789669645
monte cristo turned to albert	15.821921388301124
do you know modern greek asked he	32.99339444335306
alas no said albert nor even ancient greek my dear count never had homer or plat	58.53073171324449
then said hayde proving by her remark that she had quite understood monte cristo	47.31617924901082
monte cristo reflected one instant	239.45189642834924
you will speak in italian said he	26.737402629821347
then turning towards albertit is a pity you do not understand either ancient or 	75.21718539526327
the count made a sign to hayde to address his visitor	22.54085105846009
sir she said to morcerf you are most welcome as the friend of my lord and master	35.998971611616625
this was said in excellent tuscan and with that soft roman accent which makes th	107.67091937605447
then turning to ali she directed him to bring coffee and pipes and when he had l	39.36559974768775
monte cristo and morcerf drew their seats towards a small table on which were ar	36.66894242919226
ali then entered bringing coffee and chibouques as to m	177.36179072900862
baptistin this portion of the building was interdicted to him	79.37868711603033
albert refused the pipe which the nubian offered him	86.76918878441214
oh take ittake it said the count hayde is almost as civilized as a parisian the 	40.750390001602405
ali left the room	19.607699997724453
the cups of coffee were all prepared with the addition of sugar which had been b	70.46962665510519
monte cristo and hayde took the beverage in the original arabian manner that is 	45.30025986180209
hayde took the porcelain cup in her little slender fingers and conveyed it to he	69.03255000936241
at this moment two women entered bringing salvers filled with ices and sherbet w	43.01621464420861
my dear host and you signora said albert in italian excuse my apparent stupidity	159.0691158297863
i am quite bewildered and it is natural that it should be so	29.032498269133367
here i am in the heart of paris but a moment ago i heard the rumbling of the omn	26.15111156648103
oh signora if i could but speak greek your conversation added to the fairyscene 	153.17790114089706
i speak sufficient italian to enable me to converse with you sir said hayde quie	42.33028174135691
on what subject shall i converse with her said albert in a low tone to monte cri	19.913551508006098
just what you please you may speak of her country and of her youthful reminiscen	82.21572459187385
oh said albert it is of no use to be in the company of a greek if one converses 	25.850996208541343
do so then for of all themes which you could choose that will be the most agreea	80.11605390889143
albert turned towards hayde	30.05341427990014
at what age did you leave greece signora asked he	87.7088133351406
i left it when i was but five years old replied hayde	42.082034851436845
and have you any recollection of your country	46.57847857517627
when i shut my eyes and think i seem to see it all again	74.79597121943479
the mind can see as well as the body	131.69044612609932
the body forgets sometimes but the mind always remembers	983.1965596822876
and how far back into the past do your recollections extend	388.2607206636996
i could scarcely walk when my mother who was called vasiliki which means royal s	381.0057055182811
then when our purse was full we returned to the palace and without saying a word	117.83644454251291
and how old were you at that time	111.60489004984471
i was three years old said hayde	31.62149643655571
then you remember everything that went on about you from the time when you were 	71.84207658609762
count said albert in a low tone to monte cristo do allow the signora to tell me 	22.568980814904
you prohibited my mentioning my fathers name to her but perhaps she will allude 	142.71386130232008
monte cristo turned to hayde and with an expression of countenance which command	28.30106177537188
hayde sighed deeply and a shade of sadness clouded her beautiful brow	99.09418548928605
what are you saying to her said morcerf in an undertone	13.44415713120232
i again reminded her that you were a friend and that she need not conceal anythi	112.03245698366787
then said albert this pious pilgrimage in behalf of the prisoners was your first	76.45481881378036
oh then i remember as if it were but yesterday sitting under the shade of some s	108.98494932311417
under the oldest and thickest of these trees reclining on cushions sat my father	262.74279168381645
then from time to time there came to him an albanian who said something to which	71.32757243240546
it is very strange said albert to hear such words proceed from the mouth of anyo	39.71476837259957
and how does france appear in your eyes accustomed as they have been to gaze on 	97.71076133195282
i think it is a fine country said hayde but i see france as it really is because	33.22023853396118
so young said albert forgetting at the moment the counts command that he should 	71.50775520352744
hayde turned her eyes towards monte cristo who making at the same time some impe	36.206956896571995
nothing is ever so firmly impressed on the mind as the memory of our early child	175.45175774658983
40068 m	1.1098585138687438
speak speak signora said albert i am listening with the most intense delight and	49.75891321312852
hayde answered his remark with a melancholy smile	42.21207420957513
you wish me then to relate the history of my past sorrows said she	57.29099103507257
i beg you to do so replied albert	9.495346169487156
well i was but four years old when one night i was suddenly awakened by my mothe	73.3060689933056
we were in the palace of yanina she snatched me from the cushions on which i was	36.78918319167228
she took me away without speaking	134.12577266685577
when i saw her weeping i began to cry too	75.33901434003486
hush child said she	91.77111528405923
at other times in spite of maternal endearments or threats i had with a childs c	131.39363565485053
she bore me rapidly away	760.8814891823373
i saw then that we were descending a large staircase around us were all my mothe	123.49948336857014
behind the women came a guard of twenty men armed with long guns and pistols and	95.75230655348525
you may imagine there was something startling and ominous said hayde shaking her	151.65133450031476
here and there on the walls of the staircase were reflected gigantic shadows whi	84.36969900551155
quick said a voice at the end of the gallery	16.711550391249403
this voice made everyone bow before it resembling in its effect the wind passing	342.55524152044325
as for me it made me tremble	37.53144265112728
this voice was that of my father	51.320147315073356
he came last clothed in his splendid robes and holding in his hand the carbine w	101.60854190091028
he was leaning on the shoulder of his favorite selim and he drove us all before 	61.32669497834488
my father said hayde raising her head was that illustrious man known in europe u	62.38165347658197
albert without knowing why started on hearing these words pronounced with such a	216.60679513779206
soon said hayde we halted on our march and found ourselves on the borders of a l	32.17926490410561
my mother pressed me to her throbbing heart and at the distance of a few paces i	47.361596002110716
four marble steps led down to the waters edge and below them was a boat floating	185.45825545154642
40070 m	1.677872707974886
from where we stood i could see in the middle of the lake a large blank mass it 	113.51684462752425
this kiosk appeared to me to be at a considerable distance perhaps on account of	75.35737396633843
we stepped into the boat	82.18875699908132
i remember well that the oars made no noise whatever in striking the water and w	110.06123911227012
14 besides the rowers the boat contained only the women my father mother selim a	183.95684198909336
the palikares had remained on the shore of the lake ready to cover our retreat t	34.172026003973606
our bark flew before the wind	147.8978673049658
why does the boat go so fast asked i of my mother	156.41811917164935
silence child hush we are flying i did not understand	195.75634096749025
why should my father flyhe the allpowerfulhe before whom others were accustomed 	274.1632563044185
they hate me then they fear me	118.90440318229871
it was indeed a flight which my father was trying to effect	46.90097363206614
i have been told since that the garrison of the castle of yanina fatigued with l	28.979386816913774
here hayde cast a significant glance at monte cristo whose eyes had been riveted	48.16162306301987
the young girl then continued speaking slowly like a person who is either invent	199.76849976402715
you were saying signora said albert who was paying the most implicit attention t	68.97404787972447
had treated with the seraskier15 kourchid who had been sent by the sultan to gai	22.898378127103207
and this officer asked albert do you remember his name signora	86.02783494753945
monte cristo exchanged a rapid glance with the young girl which was quite unperc	32.11326792275701
no said she i do not remember it just at this moment but if it should occur to m	33.49961598400191
albert was on the point of pronouncing his fathers name when monte cristo gently	46.70364629876322
it was towards this kiosk that we were rowing	115.96807896766747
a ground floor ornamented with arabesques bathing its terraces in the water and 	128.2446810723543
but beneath the ground floor stretching out into the island was a large subterra	99.14716890512447
in this place were together 60000 pouches and 200 barrels the pouches contained 	268.0856948765053
near the barrels stood selim my fathers favorite whom i mentioned to you just no	227.93064307795677
he stood watch day and night with a lance provided with a lighted slowmatch in h	307.1317479855782

i can not tell you how long we remained in this state at that period i did not e	43.36984671000716
sometimes but very rarely my father summoned me and my mother to the terrace of 	140.96660869778069
my father was endeavoring to pierce with his eager looks the remotest verge of t	91.75829453549412
the heights of pindus towered above us the castle of yanina rose white and angul	55.01117856876085

take courage vasiliki said he today arrives the firman of the master and my fate	99.58502014037548
if my pardon be complete we shall return triumphant to yanina if the news be ina	85.63292990534556
but supposing our enemy should not allow us to do so said my mother	67.45296563717383
oh make yourself easy on that head said ali smiling selim and his flaming lance 	79.6734845763097
they would be glad to see me dead but they would not like themselves to die with	48.764342956696765
my mother only answered by sighs to consolations which she knew did not come fro	121.42188166246707
she prepared the iced water which he was in the habit of constantly drinkingfor 	81.71735721398721
presently he made such a sudden movement that i was paralyzed with fear	78.20506918919439
then without taking his eyes from the object which had first attracted his atten	90.91017759763238
my mother gave it him and as she did so looked whiter than the marble against wh	97.00049592857219

then count if you will not wait we must look upon these projects as if they had 	72.14093768964787
the count bit his lips till the blood almost started to prevent the ebullition o	59.066156004463494
a cloud settled on his brow evincing decided anxiety and uneasiness instead of t	95.89884460174775
my dear danglars said morcerf we have been acquainted for many years and consequ	19.6683186617286
you owe me an explanation and really it is but fair that i should know what circ	44.52161187746922
it is from no personal illfeeling towards the viscount that is all i can say sir	134.19966236813437
and towards whom do you bear this personal illfeeling then said morcerf turning 	159.10514869125782
the expression of the counts face had not remained unperceived by the banker he 	71.04024420546132
you may perhaps be better satisfied that i should not go farther into particular	139.63309738487368
a tremor of suppressed rage shook the whole frame of the count and making a viol	73.6815708966492
is it madame de morcerf who has displeased you is it my fortune which you find i	45.80149534475747
nothing of the kind sir replied danglars if such had been the case i only should	48.60087240179408
no do not seek any longer to discover the reason	84.80737264790748
i really am quite ashamed to have been the cause of your undergoing such severe 	73.26340129011558
ma foi there is no hurry	26.603532463429783
my daughter is only seventeen years old and your son twentyone	99.31699152597946
while we wait time will be progressing events will succeed each other things whi	148.974566481237
calumnies did you say sir cried morcerf turning livid with rage	60.994550897843965
does anyone dare to slander me	262.06287139725356
monsieur i told you that i considered it best to avoid all explanation	70.09936198311432
then sir i am patiently to submit to your refusal	86.64350059314243
yes sir although i assure you the refusal is as painful for me to give as it is 	86.6819732487956
enough sir said morcerf we will speak no more on the subject	24.76288738658536
and clutching his gloves in anger he left the apartment	105.41024180860332
danglars observed that during the whole conversation morcerf had never once dare	115.62336758454018
that evening he had a long conference with several friends and m	88.36380840565013
cavalcanti who had remained in the drawingroom with the ladies was the last to l	42.04589094938167
the next morning as soon as he awoke danglars asked for the newspapers they were	44.529361340823
he hastily tore off the cover opened the journal with nervous precipitation pass	317.956244180983
we hear from yanina	50.981412005577056
very good observed danglars after having read the paragraph here is a little art	126.63079061985741
at the same moment that is at nine oclock in the morning albert de morcerf dress	16.025181660420333
when he presented himself at the gate the porter informed him that the count had	33.583599830238704
did he take baptistin with him	41.554248221544086
no my lord	7.733087079167199
call him then i wish to speak to him	16.137993371039364
the concierge went to seek the valet de chambre and returned with him in an inst	34.38124969341325
my good friend said albert i beg pardon for my intrusion but i was anxious to kn	15.192930213257473
he is really out sir replied baptistin	37.95344087813473
out even to me	201.29930518731862
i know how happy my master always is to receive the vicomte said baptistin and i	60.7247510700075
you are right and now i wish to see him on an affair of great importance	41.49718173721872
do you think it will be long before he comes in	21.96585018773722
no i think not for he ordered his breakfast at ten oclock	75.78565242706058
well i will go and take a turn in the champslyses and at ten oclock i will retur	21.66140183639345
you may depend on my doing so sir said baptistin	50.893158707750004
albert left the cab in which he had come at the counts door intending to take a 	35.41680254135411
as he was passing the alle des veuves he thought he saw the counts horses standi	42.73771954515837
is the count shooting in the gallery said morcerf	43.087613628663284
yes sir replied the coachman	30.50810400613922
while he was speaking albert had heard the report of two or three pistolshots	27.198462038492046
he entered and on his way met the waiter	121.30133903438252
excuse me my lord said the lad but will you have the kindness to wait a moment	28.866007724804497
what for philip asked albert who being a constant visitor there did not understa	115.71111829344902
because the person who is now in the gallery prefers being alone and never pract	82.13614080096993
not even before you philip then who loads his pistol	158.70863030762249
his servant	347.4219936611583
a nubian	65.08688540622155
a negro	1194.4334890754837
it is he then	15.444389498096857
do you know this gentleman	9.549700386735484
yes and i am come to look for him he is a friend of mine	25.0189271789387
oh that is quite another thing then	69.78073649733382
i will go immediately and inform him of your arrival	59.11946811194586
and philip urged by his own curiosity entered the gallery a second afterwards mo	97.06559635562796
i ask your pardon my dear count said albert for following you here and i must fi	24.598368286747757
i went to your house and they told me you were out but that they expected you ho	78.98153238986937
i was walking about in order to pass away the time till ten oclock when i caught	56.12804364465037
what you have just said induces me to hope that you intend breakfasting with me	74.29254261815132
40092 m	2.323449058570318
no thank you i am thinking of other things besides breakfast just now perhaps we	130.76902986576712
what on earth are you talking of	72.16543427736626
i am to fight today	89.60404183884202
for what	30.983424495210123
for the sake of fighting	19.00803698400163
yes i understand that but what is the quarrel people fight for all sorts of reas	60.8904592535043
i fight in the cause of honor	78.99121194462819
ah that is something serious	64.27022292308514
so serious that i come to beg you to render me a service	41.230565761088684
what is it	5.006152748037041
to be my second	197.8298659076817
that is a serious matter and we will not discuss it here let us speak of nothing	33.4894262103016
ali bring me some water	221.7349128434148
the count turned up his sleeves and passed into the little vestibule where the g	33.73242559172369
come in my lord said philip in a low tone and i will show you something droll	21.100527665636676
morcerf entered and in place of the usual target he saw some playingcards fixed 	119.29882378208556
at a distance albert thought it was a complete suit for he counted from the ace 	93.95587169732477
ah ha said albert i see you were preparing for a game of cards	25.808916270618433
no said the count i was making a suit	32.21486026486102
how said albert	24.187802435438396
those are really aces and twos which you see but my shots have turned them into 	127.87097742149514
albert approached	670.3053434302419
in fact the bullets had actually pierced the cards in the exact places which the	131.06824172462532
in going up to the target morcerf picked up two or three swallows that had been 	43.89953570125093
diable said morcerf	3.6596170576372713
what would you have my dear viscount said monte cristo wiping his hands on the t	11.428494807647596
but come i am waiting for you	44.983730435756705
both men entered monte cristos carriage which in the course of a few minutes dep	28.398297954417153
monte cristo took albert into his study and pointing to a seat placed another fo	44.452255912375
now let us talk the matter over quietly said the count	74.82857658960653
you see i am perfectly composed said albert	49.21357125888459
with whom are you going to fight	15.384790076794452
with beauchamp	25.988687381361903
one of your friends	21.74059896766359
of course it is always with friends that one fights	165.4126498792926
i suppose you have some cause of quarrel	72.19355367254205
i have	10.98544439097405
40094 m	2.0640056703048453
what has he done to you	22.09885377020703
there appeared in his journal last nightbut wait and read for yourself	267.78290126934155
and albert handed over the paper to the count who read as follows	69.0692625407779
a correspondent at yanina informs us of a fact of which until now we had remaine	101.82593028221726
the castle which formed the protection of the town was given up to the turks by 	36.19111988657247
well said monte cristo what do you see in that to annoy you	19.357079791609628
what do i see in it	28.045955238328276
yes what does it signify to you if the castle of yanina was given up by a french	20.206981739399932
it signifies to my father the count of morcerf whose christian name is fernand	28.58007424238859
did your father serve under ali pasha	188.1598397228338
yes that is to say he fought for the independence of the greeks and hence arises	57.467055395063205
oh my dear viscount do talk reason	369.47749233005334
i do not desire to do otherwise	28.20382904094665
now just tell me who the devil should know in france that the officer fernand an	90.6690853160682
that just shows the meanness of this slander	98.76496335245466
they have allowed all this time to elapse and then all of a sudden rake up event	118.56792373436303
i inherit my fathers name and i do not choose that the shadow of disgrace should	71.54991220306687
i am going to beauchamp in whose journal this paragraph appears and i shall insi	57.951284629034326
beauchamp will never retract	304.57558324666513
then we must fight	53.737537834774606
no you will not for he will tell you what is very true that perhaps there were f	47.61064740868012
we will fight nevertheless	142.70569538330398
i will efface that blot on my fathers character	134.21604516276312
my father who was such a brave soldier whose career was so brilliant	64.39676385797043
oh well he will add we are warranted in believing that this fernand is not the i	106.48676714290518
i am determined not to be content with anything short of an entire retractation	82.18389750173631
and you intend to make him do it in the presence of two witnesses do you	47.09835987612776
you do wrong	370.80722404592234
which means i suppose that you refuse the service which i asked of you	116.65458021226087
you know my theory regarding duels i told you my opinion on that subject if you 	93.22936898498567
nevertheless my dear count i found you this morning engaged in an occupation but	59.47678515853013
because my dear fellow you understand one must never be eccentric	58.62363278446998
if ones lot is cast among fools it is necessary to study folly	412.59841773997795
i shall perhaps find myself one day called out by some harebrained scamp who has	194.07991664669723
you admit that you would fight then well if so why do you object to my doing so	102.03020900560948
i do not say that you ought not to fight i only say that a duel is a serious thi	28.77456465181034
did he reflect before he insulted my father	172.73632522866205
if he spoke hastily and owns that he did so you ought to be satisfied	91.82924680545284
ah my dear count you are far too indulgent	31.73447596624316
and you are far too exacting	58.11205685315278
supposing for instance and do not be angry at what i am going to say	25.390733847822073
supposing the assertion to be really true	263.0795242018691
a son ought not to submit to such a stain on his fathers honor	91.58449437452535
ma foi we live in times when there is much to which we must submit	90.85332103634597
that is precisely the fault of the age	35.988690857163526
and do you undertake to reform it	50.88739544366969
yes as far as i am personally concerned	81.57031556574657
well you are indeed exacting my dear fellow	33.17621489858872
yes i own it	119.5767512475577
are you quite impervious to good advice	93.3813963163298
not when it comes from a friend	71.19348869853715
and do you account me that title	111.43509631555885
certainly i do	18.8299761685378
well then before going to beauchamp with your witnesses seek further information	230.7793455506164
from whom	64.15237299305439
from hayde	9.305928005597996
why what can be the use of mixing a woman up in the affairwhat can she do in it	57.63104584200226
she can declare to you for example that your father had no hand whatever in the 	125.5028912790717
i have told you my dear count that i would not for one moment admit of such a pr	27.35095875003213
you reject this means of information then	246.79929598472714
i domost decidedly	1929.1147056252967
then let me offer one more word of advice	123.65628683734069
do so then but let it be the last	45.13980200890093
you do not wish to hear it perhaps	32.94811600853889
on the contrary i request it	15.444739313851391
do not take any witnesses with you when you go to beauchampvisit him alone	58.07936826452839
that would be contrary to all custom	119.0933008373834
your case is not an ordinary one	79.95359161550084
and what is your reason for advising me to go alone	40.59836204878877
because then the affair will rest between you and beauchamp	141.90120186382993
explain yourself	86.48264615823472
i will do so	13.871221437513737
if beauchamp be disposed to retract you ought at least to give him the opportuni	40.03448207531764
if on the contrary he refuses to do so it will then be quite time enough to admi	33.73314941881761
they will not be strangers they will be friends	69.66666657459494
ah but the friends of today are the enemies of tomorrow beauchamp for instance	93.91197633644421
so you recommend	378.29801964778926
i recommend you to be prudent	82.84609075142667
then you advise me to go alone to beauchamp	19.17737233919726
i do and i will tell you why	36.69378844779902
when you wish to obtain some concession from a mans selflove you must avoid even	90.33183733080759
i believe you are right	17.657455868937625
i am glad of it	12.358221692017784
then i will go alone	23.45289662986039
go but you would do better still by not going at all	164.48414746047192
that is impossible	21.593276072024985
do so then it will be a wiser plan than the first which you proposed	50.90036673964453
but if in spite of all my precautions i am at last obliged to fight will you not	42.15610439371885
my dear viscount said monte cristo gravely you must have seen before today that 	32.67125806908688
perhaps you may know at some future period and in the mean time i request you to	91.98385946251666
well i will have franz and chteaurenaud they will be the very men for it	44.43790820639427
do so then	42.267120674242825
but if i do fight you will surely not object to giving me a lesson or two in sho	70.23111715977359
that too is impossible	527.638378319241
what a singular being you areyou will not interfere in anything	170.94325728086775
you are rightthat is the principle on which i wish to act	71.96461538937123
we will say no more about it then	42.271071147452446
goodbye count	528.8207000688373
morcerf took his hat and left the room	20.140659279116267
he found his carriage at the door and doing his utmost to restrain his anger he 	49.944053743142206
it was a gloomy dustylooking apartment such as journalists offices have always b	96.9404775380303
the servant announced m	339.0142613223137
albert de morcerf	19.545469319295734
beauchamp repeated the name to himself as though he could scarcely believe that 	46.01815522327416
albert entered	440.3894103260599
beauchamp uttered an exclamation of surprise on seeing his friend leap over and 	68.8988051388005
this way this way my dear albert said he holding out his hand to the young man	18.45149500317703
are you out of your senses or do you come peaceably to take breakfast with me tr	46.67509371165197
beauchamp said albert it is of your journal that i come to speak	31.86724269915555
indeed what do you wish to say about it	15.792122383499308
i desire that a statement contained in it should be rectified	116.30050775061507
to what do you refer but pray sit down	90.70830738786324
thank you said albert with a cold and formal bow	30.86166030016725
will you now have the kindness to explain the nature of the statement which has 	48.44457913874434
an announcement has been made which implicates the honor of a member of my famil	60.683879216301094
what is it said beauchamp much surprised surely you must be mistaken	49.55779633663819
the story sent you from yanina	158.1637013099139
yes really you appear to be totally ignorant of the cause which brings me here	82.52841688488135
such is really the case i assure you upon my honor baptiste give me yesterdays p	61.189757624584296
here i have brought mine with me replied albert	42.2979481928419
beauchamp took the paper and read the article to which albert pointed in an unde	28.81289171649534
you see it is a serious annoyance said morcerf when beauchamp had finished the p	23.506553462227462
is the officer referred to a relation of yours then demanded the journalist	90.52743052557052
yes said albert blushing	16.754924370566222
well what do you wish me to do for you said beauchamp mildly	25.67433213192461
my dear beauchamp i wish you to contradict this statement	34.131663961576365
beauchamp looked at albert with a benevolent expression	12.675163892286845
come said he this matter will want a good deal of talking over a retractation is	69.2353544647204
sit down and i will read it again	22.898268939387993
albert resumed his seat and beauchamp read with more attention than at first the	69.2630917706673
well said albert in a determined tone you see that your paper has insulted a mem	32.764208949679535
you insist	2293.1328910879497
yes i insist	132.42770486561267
permit me to remind you that you are not in the chamber my dear viscount	20.52413351813864
nor do i wish to be there replied the young man rising	19.496633020569124
i repeat that i am determined to have the announcement of yesterday contradicted	77.92952714877364
you have known me long enough continued albert biting his lips convulsively for 	65.49535207146126
if i have been your friend morcerf your present manner of speaking would almost 	137.75273995182138
but wait a moment do not let us get angry or at least not yet	75.6379222980127
you are irritated and vexedtell me how this fernand is related to you	110.70274336306994
he is merely my father said albertm	38.42887747563596
fernand mondego count of morcerf an old soldier who has fought in twenty battles	54.418379529321975
is it your father said beauchamp that is quite another thing	26.79030748603354
then i can well understand your indignation my dear albert	56.22477147247391

noirtier acknowledged by a look of extreme kindness and benevolence the thanks w	89.25968844015243
morrel then cast on the invalid an interrogative look as to the new favor which 	143.0127147072838
valentine was sitting at a little distance from them timidly awaiting the moment	68.83549267802337

therefore continued valentine looking playfully at maximilian no more inconsider	68.96839113679464

noirtier regarded the lovers with a look of ineffable tenderness while barrois w	35.73568259505544

valentine and morrel were exchanging their adieux in the presence of noirtier wh	33.643449029086376
it was the signal of a visit	18.42315967301752

at this moment barrois entered	6.154193165921969

doctor davrigny said barrois staggering as if he would fall	44.25255799103904
what is the matter barrois said valentine	5.94780595037404
the old man did not answer but looked at his master with wild staring eyes while	47.496918939866255
he is going to fall cried morrel	27.971477796717764
the rigors which had attacked barrois gradually increased the features of the fa	108.8326853954236

a slight appearance of foam was visible around the mouth and he breathed painful	135.76531532472424

oh come come	115.48154096445566
but where is the doctor exclaimed villefort where is he	32.3588471092342
madame de villefort now deliberately descended the staircase	79.64256567694571
in one hand she held her handkerchief with which she appeared to be wiping her f	65.01014799679395
her first look on entering the room was at noirtier whose face independent of th	53.677610985847494

madame de villefort started	12.110238090605973
noirtier looked at her with a glance of the most profound scrutiny	17.186522640583735
he has such a short neck said she	157.60741584016807

morrel looked towards noirtier for permission to retire	85.00583799031926
the old man who had preserved all his usual coolness made a sign to him to do so	34.645610011519686
the young man pressed valentines hand to his lips and then left the house by a b	34.983660019289985
at the same moment that he quitted the room villefort and the doctor entered by 	21.157335855966192
barrois was now showing signs of returning consciousness	300.17631594105353
the crisis seemed past a low moaning was heard and he raised himself on one knee	96.3090777914649
davrigny and villefort laid him on a couch	55.94431617621084
what do you prescribe doctor demanded villefort	49.13723416392031

send for some oil of turpentine and tartar emetic	86.75520523790416
villefort immediately despatched a messenger	631.6338647702665
and now let everyone retire	588.4645850301115

davrigny with astonishment kissed her grandfather on the forehead and left the r	53.695671634330324

because i feel that if you were only to touch me with the tip of your finger the	33.13999186502086
barrois took the glass and raising it to his purple lips took about half of the 	43.312155904912395
where do you suffer asked the doctor	30.80598114703475

what have you eaten today	125.59939760521107
i have eaten nothing i only drank a glass of my masters lemonadethats all	74.5283535770984
and barrois turned towards noirtier who immovably fixed in his armchair was cont	46.24228917942901

davrigny bounded towards the door flew down the back staircase and almost knocke	97.38423145464236
she cried out but davrigny paid no attention to her possessed with but one idea 	146.97429977344243
he darted upon it as an eagle would seize upon its prey	143.40071713252067
panting with loss of breath he returned to the room he had just left	54.91300354932279
madame de villefort was slowly ascending the steps which led to her room	59.72600116917828
is this the decanter you spoke of asked davrigny	138.69710592632393
yes doctor	722.5440982953595

what did it taste like	185.60936120215763

the doctor poured some drops of the lemonade into the palm of his hand put his l	39.10693511550272
it is no doubt the same said he	27.103964117403677

and did you also discover a bitter taste	209.34081613873045
oh doctor cried barrois the fit is coming on again	86.38607915182045

villefort sprang into the passage exclaiming the emetic the emeticis it come yet	303.6648845268701
the most profound terror reigned throughout the house	146.01464883206327

this second attack was much more violent than the first and he had slipped from 	55.53802433082941
the doctor left him in this paroxysm knowing that he could do nothing to allevia	47.00428651738083

did barrois make your lemonade	129.4614680891893
was it you who asked him to drink some of it	74.9984682139814

davrigny he left m	336.60499523526397
noirtier and returned to the sick man	33.9538335208578
barrois said the doctor can you speak barrois muttered a few unintelligible word	89.89252481814609
try and make an effort to do so my good man	66.3214148368054
said davrigny	1.8118412667592048
barrois reopened his bloodshot eyes	418.5049863303725

mademoiselle valentine	2.518579889191624
davrigny struck his forehead with his hand	31.123829190773716
gracious heaven exclaimed he	111.17980313772415
doctor doctor cried barrois who felt another fit coming	267.8012890932527

here is a glass with one already prepared said villefort entering the room	107.08603981566903
who prepared it	295.88728845111496

i am choking oh my heart ah my headoh what agonyshall i suffer like this long	152.49736132194002
no no friend replied the doctor you will soon cease to suffer	65.95445096727192
ah i understand you said the unhappy man	16.235287263040004
my god have mercy upon me and uttering a fearful cry barrois fell back as if he 	76.44687171015978
davrigny put his hand to his heart and placed a glass before his lips	19.679993774784354
well said villefort	4.567295049847642
go to the kitchen and get me some syrup of violets	86.72000812187646
villefort went immediately	156.74462392174266
do not be alarmed m	26.35394263481614
noirtier said davrigny i am going to take my patient into the next room to bleed	36.48517255672576
and taking barrois under the arms he dragged him into an adjoining room but almo	56.574708464233495
noirtier closed his right eye	170.69596559683401
you want valentine do you not i will tell them to send her to you	46.26460920662542
villefort returned and davrigny met him in the passage	37.639558025907846
well how is he now asked he	27.794221736519
come in here said davrigny and he took him into the chamber where the sick man l	28.943805446060843
is he still in a fit said the procureur	29.46388745817421
he is dead	19.781000356031377
villefort drew back a few steps and clasping his hands exclaimed with real amaze	75.01095021025759

de villefort	1.0584866980070828
the magistrate trembled convulsively	1280.2759666452946
there is a poison which destroys life almost without leaving any perceptible tra	179.44203620506215
i know it well i have studied it in all its forms and in the effects which it pr	53.42626498995836
i recognized the presence of this poison in the case of poor barrois as well as 	32.05267881035421
there is a way of detecting its presence	50.810097387851016
it restores the blue color of litmuspaper reddened by an acid and it turns syrup	122.82153473800764
we have no litmuspaper but see here they come with the syrup of violets	91.5705644200817
the doctor was right steps were heard in the passage	87.48042402259141
davrigny opened the door and took from the hands of the chambermaid a cup which 	31.115994130048552

if the lemonade be pure and inoffensive the syrup will retain its color if on th	107.46457052521758
look closely	11025.92259910602
the doctor then slowly poured some drops of the lemonade from the decanter into 	118.75679648866424
arrived at this last hue it changed no more	167.55787780574443
the result of the experiment left no doubt whatever on the mind	68.64063435876146
the unfortunate barrois has been poisoned said davrigny and i will maintain this	46.05889976704296
villefort said nothing but he clasped his hands opened his haggard eyes and over	66.8122319673431

the accusation	1961.7581677712424
davrigny soon restored the magistrate to consciousness who had looked like a sec	133.21983723408593

davrigny with an imposing calmness but i think it is now time to act	59.4282797200302

i can no longer bear to be in possession of these secrets without the hope of se	64.91260459721022

but the latter went on without pity	244.2371936543708

i know not why but i feel that this crime	64.42357644844157
you acknowledge then the existence of the crime	115.58632379580236
yes i see too plainly that it does exist	81.42846952516427
but it seems that it is intended to affect me personally	43.67308322955242

he acknowledged the extreme kindness which had been shown him by the bankers fam	62.648149358766815
danglars listened with the most profound attention he had expected this declarat	39.88622806892471
he would not however yield immediately to the young mans request but made a few 	100.01350179807521

what man said andrea carelessly apparently forgetting him whom he but too well r	172.65101398842958
him to whom your excellency pays that little annuity	199.62604604222037

well you gave him the two hundred francs i had left for him	41.7319878339313
yes your excellency	15.400016220501767
andrea had expressed a wish to be thus addressed	147.85605296019045
but continued the porter he would not take them	51.0300548598546
andrea turned pale but as it was dark his pallor was not perceptible	50.35615160553711
what he would not take them said he with slight emotion	69.84565106626638
40130 m	1.714492566867236
no he wished to speak to your excellency i told him you were gone out and after 	47.53006495689382

you know where i live i expect you tomorrow morning at nine oclock	82.12016280517851
andrea examined it carefully to ascertain if the letter had been opened or if an	88.31422925142958
very well said he	6.339127117127998
poor man he is a worthy creature	29.460761615506012
he left the porter to ponder on these words not knowing which most to admire the	141.43765189705647
take out the horses quickly and come up to me said andrea to his groom	35.907243878651265
in two seconds the young man had reached his room and burnt caderousses letter	50.98903370745453
the servant entered just as he had finished	76.6404981292109
you are about my height pierre said he	38.977539239044305

pierre obeyed	492.7952366014628
five minutes after andrea left the hotel completely disguised took a cabriolet a	100.28517941100264
the next morning he left that inn as he had left the htel des princes without be	38.99694778996887
for whom are you looking my fine fellow asked the fruiteress on the opposite sid	43.04896382457479
monsieur pailletin if you please my good woman replied andrea	28.484640038014827
a retired baker asked the fruiteress	208.8760648760662
he lives at the end of the yard on the left on the third story	45.819123499153214
40132 m	9.348052007906078
andrea went as she directed him and on the third floor he found a hares paw whic	45.41014683016324
a moment after caderousses face appeared at the grating in the door	52.43682080504866
ah you are punctual said he as he drew back the door	27.51673326502375
confound you and your punctuality said andrea throwing himself into a chair in a	35.1805449955534
come come my little fellow do nt be angry	39.101509028788584
see i have thought about youlook at the good breakfast we are going to have noth	54.00197316632304
andrea indeed inhaled the scent of something cooking which was not unwelcome to 	141.80778896334058
these odors escaped from two deep dishes which were covered and placed on a stov	101.57264625318045
in an adjoining room andrea saw also a tolerably clean table prepared for two tw	111.20504098060485
what do you think of it my little fellow said caderousse	12.434711028877597
ay that smells good you know i used to be a good cook do you recollect how you u	87.60373375802544
while speaking caderousse went on peeling a fresh supply of onions	69.82027726498313
but said andrea illtemperedly by my faith if it was only to breakfast with you t	62.35592858707578
my boy said caderousse sententiously one can talk while eating	230.18115176722247
and then you ungrateful being you are not pleased to see an old friend i am weep	75.22009062563193
he was truly crying but it would have been difficult to say whether joy or the o	61.53408421157421
hold your tongue hypocrite said andrea you love me	27.237144331782513
yes i do or may the devil take me	159.44904671019617
i know it is a weakness said caderousse but it overpowers me	20.66686207059521
and yet it has not prevented your sending for me to play me some trick	83.36302775930479
come said caderousse wiping his large knife on his apron if i did not like you d	30.42185824420023

this address was accompanied by a look which was by no means difficult to unders	43.958553867346225
well said andrea admitting your love why do you want me to breakfast with you	35.7046149627305
that i may have the pleasure of seeing you my little fellow	32.07486343504667
what is the use of seeing me after we have made all our arrangements	48.76481963836628
eh dear friend said caderousse are wills ever made without codicils but you firs	106.9918197249948
ah yes you look at my room my four straw chairs my images three francs each	172.02105175541044
but what do you expect this is not the htel des princes	22.38215454881547
come you are growing discontented you are no longer happy you who only wish to l	84.55411621575642
caderousse sighed	616.758524654067
well what have you to say you have seen your dream realized	74.29020457557883
i can still say it is a dream a retired baker my poor benedetto is richhe has an	59.5930926875941
well you have an annuity	49.3796559747509

40134 m	2.002095250151223
yes since i bring you your two hundred francs	59.47823157391944
caderousse shrugged his shoulders	21.680436141112896
it is humiliating said he thus to receive money given grudginglyan uncertain sup	268.98612686997893
you see i am obliged to economize in case your prosperity should cease	99.60852840445742
well my friend fortune is inconstant as the chaplain of the regiment said	68.42589945713169
i know your prosperity is great you rascal you are to marry the daughter of dang	52.53594201886673
what of danglars	155.06423565511184
yes to be sure must i say baron danglars i might as well say count benedetto	80.25040936335765
he was an old friend of mine and if he had not so bad a memory he ought to invit	25.2220194225487
yes yes to mine gad he was not so proud thenhe was an underclerk to the good m	120.30819060286987
i have dined many times with him and the count of morcerf so you see i have some	66.06247413054699
come your jealousy represents everything to you in the wrong light	206.45272452782746
that is all very fine benedetto mio but i know what i am saying	38.84741374345513
perhaps i may one day put on my best coat and presenting myself at the great gat	112.72382231372131
meanwhile let us sit down and eat	24.844750540575564
caderousse set the example and attacked the breakfast with good appetite praisin	147.5675534362804
the latter seemed to have resigned himself he drew the corks and partook largely	165.672035955043
ah mate said caderousse you are getting on better terms with your old landlord	78.3981393102128
faith yes replied andrea whose hunger prevailed over every other feeling	172.88811207400815
so you like it you rogue	165.03416853376285
so much that i wonder how a man who can cook thus can complain of hard living	141.6010925448596
do you see said caderousse all my happiness is marred by one thought	49.96031024906616
what is that	6.370865639164272
that i am dependent on another i who have always gained my own livelihood honest	152.96134197331799
do not let that disturb you i have enough for two	57.862180458689
no truly you may believe me if you will at the end of every month i am tormented	46.676150903529106
good caderousse	38.91473225006965
so much so that yesterday i would not take the two hundred francs	47.7877719893937
yes you wished to speak to me but was it indeed remorse tell me	88.81665360164281
true remorse and besides an idea had struck me	195.0746267998041
andrea shuddered he always did so at caderousses ideas	209.67368567473528
it is miserabledo you seealways to wait till the end of the month	34.99219365180096
oh said andrea philosophically determined to watch his companion narrowly does n	155.19967962693508
yes because instead of expecting two hundred wretched francs you expect five or 	252.7381261144157
down there you always had little presents and christmasboxes which you tried to 	216.02421969860964
fortunately he is a cunning fellow that friend caderousse	57.005625053813716
there you are beginning again to ramble to talk again and again of the past but 	89.31201288173884
ah you are only oneandtwenty and can forget the past i am fifty and am obliged t	93.54067406965181
but let us return to business	46.36676351896067
i was going to say if i were in your place	21.680296578055067
i would realize	876.4050426359921
how would you realize	142.86045092487083
i would ask for six months in advance under pretence of being able to purchase a	92.43198209686719
well well said andrea that is nt a bad idea	20.199891300020298
my dear friend said caderousse eat of my bread and take my advice you will be no	34.54340944182802
but said andrea why do you not act on the advice you gave me why do you not real	41.04091798360973
but how the devil would you have me retire on twelve hundred francs	77.22962764279768
ah caderousse said andrea how covetous you are two months ago you were dying wit	45.582605960970206
the appetite grows by what it feeds on said caderousse grinning and showing his 	249.489970610739
and added he biting off with his large white teeth an enormous mouthful of bread	114.08444883412179
caderousses plans alarmed andrea still more than his ideas ideas were but the ge	245.06184815045708
let me see your plan i dare say it is a pretty one	46.33693648714769
why not who formed the plan by which we left the establishment of m eh was it no	158.26154913800403
i do not say replied andrea that you never make a good one but let us see your p	25.069931932844206
well pursued caderousse can you without expending one sou put me in the way of g	97.06360614325729
no replied andrea dryly no i can not	35.40637570718746
i do not think you understand me replied caderousse calmly i said without your l	32.61159879767695
do you want me to commit a robbery to spoil all my good fortuneand yours with mi	86.96548554098378
it would make very little difference to me said caderousse if i were retaken i a	58.045148070180296
andrea did more than tremble this time he turned pale	219.761493771654
come caderousse no nonsense said he	71.94492104356395
do nt alarm yourself my little benedetto but just point out to me some means of 	130.78910988877823
well ill seeill try to contrive some way said andrea	166.1411604972605
meanwhile you will raise my monthly allowance to five hundred francs my little f	53.2249673543405
well you shall have your five hundred francs said andrea but it is very hard for	21.366424588183673
bah said caderousse when you have access to countless stores	46.12521959798352
one would have said andrea anticipated his companions words so did his eye flash	147.96664341007195
true he replied and my protector is very kind	65.66637522095999
that dear protector said caderousse and how much does he give you monthly	74.85791215807636
five thousand francs	6.227464329196388
as many thousands as you give me hundreds truly it is only bastards who are thus	160.51275858617188
five thousand francs per month what the devil can you do with all that	26.355450662654363
oh it is no trouble to spend that and i am like you i want capital	80.51875994286061
capitalyesi understandeveryone would like capital	2290.448947408919
well and i shall get it	35.47201878997438
who will give it to youyour prince	96.2426031575477
yes my prince	111.1277019372657
but unfortunately i must wait	129.5196327317311
40138 m	1.1978092148517652
you must wait for what asked caderousse	49.46173502427056
for his death	289.3436079844202
the death of your prince	176.7383197994009
how so	20.836389722085887
because he has made his will in my favor	56.50418083055759
on my honor	11.341095986134329
for how much	275.46580916727265
for five hundred thousand	31.38590538789766
only that its little enough	862.0223155582885
but so it is	27.856110638312504
no it can not be	14.505506854074447
are you my friend caderousse	12.724111725028706
yes in life or death	340.15746597945673
well i will tell you a secret	20.592725206680722
what is it	5.1368009474323255
but remember	1163.959356128192
ah pardieu mute as a carp	244.79673172881556
well i think	24.691205422979163
andrea stopped and looked around	46.945096432065895
you think do not fear pardieu we are alone	103.05152549973477
i think i have discovered my father	31.122768077486683
your true father	585.3179416028838
not old cavalcanti	308.20976350392783
no for he has gone again the true one as you say	70.39456499087427
and that father is	271.88484910424273
well caderousse it is monte cristo	25.15579077403035
yes you understand that explains all	92.18461217830557
he can not acknowledge me openly it appears but he does it through m	129.353173680916
cavalcanti and gives him fifty thousand francs for it	54.63614747768812
fifty thousand francs for being your father i would have done it for half that f	55.59133287726581
did i know anything about it when it was all done when i was down there	52.902030653770005
ah truly and you say that by his will	155.29421275765802
he leaves me five hundred thousand livres	58.87196885106985
are you sure of it	6.024713621102312
he showed it me but that is not allthere is a codicil as i said just now	108.21718774165896
and in that codicil he acknowledges me	72.1211950902324
oh the good father the brave father the very honest father said caderousse twirl	147.49586821252348
now say if i conceal anything from you	181.90048279252335
no and your confidence makes you honorable in my opinion and your princely fathe	109.4020095586285
yes he is that he does not himself know the amount of his fortune	36.23678552513397
is it possible	4.81166994905434
it is evident enough to me who am always at his house	43.269147069618185
the other day a bankers clerk brought him fifty thousand francs in a portfolio a	81.66403034220546
caderousse was filled with wonder the young mans words sounded to him like metal	73.88686389914628
and you go into that house cried he briskly	81.76880835616193
when i like	86.90326377985497
caderousse was thoughtful for a moment	21.013168787872075
it was easy to perceive he was revolving some unfortunate idea in his mind	81.02156138132257
then suddenly	1671.4579836036207
how i should like to see all that cried he how beautiful it must be	58.79406354801452
it is in fact magnificent said andrea	15.223213610607292
and does he not live in the champslyses	39.6566728504248
yes no	193.43918042700648
ah said caderousse no	15.104032591348345
yes a fine house standing alone between a courtyard and a gardenyou must know it	217.38614525482654
possibly but it is not the exterior i care for it is the interior	52.854615073267475
what beautiful furniture there must be in it	282.7200937695013
have you ever seen the tuileries	8.191302181107561
well it surpasses that	60.609240491389684
it must be worth ones while to stoop andrea when that good m	155.34938984580083
monte cristo lets fall his purse	210.46602241310913
it is not worthwhile to wait for that said andrea money is as plentiful in that 	41.93236641010719
but you should take me there one day with you	64.02716714033036
how can i on what plea	100.73607777600343
you are right but you have made my mouth water	64.54644881654625
i must absolutely see it i shall find a way	96.39595876133046
no nonsense caderousse	85.560114874897
i will offer myself as floorpolisher	90.88698865295488
the rooms are all carpeted	114.46047954805304
well then i must be contented to imagine it	37.01422787139247
that is the best plan believe me	47.934002876646005
try at least to give me an idea of what it is	21.220159884810247
how can i	10.30132501919422
nothing is easier	125.7083856110903
is it large	72.78139265603492
how is it arranged	35.76809051383588
faith i should require pen ink and paper to make a plan	75.54013586798659
they are all here said caderousse briskly	30.527116102661804
he fetched from an old secretaire a sheet of white paper and pen and ink	104.7444516741163
here said caderousse draw me all that on the paper my boy	55.06067319252451
andrea took the pen with an imperceptible smile and began	17.26072986747203
the house as i said is between the court and the garden in this way do you see a	61.67693864837285
40142 m	3.8524492175780227
high walls	2289.814483851547
not more than eight or ten feet	51.81302736086452
that is not prudent said caderousse	17.701039578865107
in the court are orangetrees in pots turf and clumps of flowers	52.44536030642253
and no steeltraps	804.0450532222557
the stables	11981.510597133325
are on either side of the gate which you see there	60.00466687174597
and andrea continued his plan	86.84907885267849
let us see the ground floor said caderousse	15.176913708843971
on the ground floor diningroom two drawingrooms billiardroom staircase in the ha	109.44839580231813
magnificent windows so beautiful so large that i believe a man of your size shou	92.67625946023063
why the devil have they any stairs with such windows	168.34921095753978
luxury has everything	605.5060231517821
but shutters	112779.96304937467
yes but they are never used	59.02811742693355
that count of monte cristo is an original who loves to look at the sky even at n	55.30193207977075
and where do the servants sleep	265.3411988190631
oh they have a house to themselves	155.76157805081252
picture to yourself a pretty coachhouse at the righthand side where the ladders 	122.34882454851164
well over that coachhouse are the servants rooms with bells corresponding with t	275.43323571456835
ah diable bells did you say	232.67678172875713
what do you mean	3.9053880056099968

caderousse looked at the young man as if to get at the truth from the bottom of 	20.298711540076734
but andrea drew a cigarcase from his pocket took a havana quietly lit it and beg	50.496503035741895

caderousse had become so gloomy that andrea feared he should be obliged to notic	50.63822356112464
he redoubled his gayety and carelessness	194.4390435912013
how sprightly you are said caderousse one would say you were already in possessi	54.5932687963486

caderousse looked so closely at it that andrea well knew that he was examining t	54.246857007108034
it is a false diamond said caderousse	25.670243470679498

monte cristo was eager to ascertain the strength and number of his enemies	62.475185112215435
the window whence the noise proceeded was opposite the opening by which the coun	128.50459476788498

at last he appeared to have made himself familiar with his surroundings	77.58733383286844
there were two doors he bolted them both	191.41769987746315
when he drew near to the bedroom door monte cristo expected that he was coming i	57.23850898235874
it was only a precaution	36.322036787756296
the nocturnal visitor ignorant of the fact that the count had removed the staple	146.67660956339324
alone and free to act as he wished the man then drew from his pocket something w	70.19013882047325
but the glasscutter was a prudent man who had provided for all emergencies	102.55568330867185
the count soon heard the rattling of a bunch of skeleton keys such as the locksm	64.68226156298324
ah ha whispered monte cristo with a smile of disappointment he is only a thief	30.53470096215867

who feared the dagger at his breast and whose head was cleft with a hatchet	88.5822115256888

ali bowed in token of strict obedience	50.93504994026675
monte cristo then drew a lighted taper from a closet and when the thief was deep	150.1486445006889
the door opened so quietly that the thief heard no sound but to his astonishment	128.7851145810982
he turned	90.09567265030127
ah goodevening my dear m	65.05204148184148

the abb busoni exclaimed caderousse and not knowing how this strange apparition 	97.65589122462146
the count placed himself between caderousse and the window thus cutting off from	159.390285399397
the abb busoni repeated caderousse fixing his haggard gaze on the count	30.23507822376455
yes undoubtedly the abb busoni himself replied monte cristo	52.057180979200034

caderousse it proves you have a good memory for it must be about ten years since	38.622851849264556
this calmness of busoni combined with his irony and boldness staggered caderouss	112.97651939094227
the abb the abb murmured he clenching his fists and his teeth chattering	83.59764727446282
so you would rob the count of monte cristo continued the false abb	57.607527227906026

caderousse scarcely yet relying on this promise put his legs out of the window a	88.58753383611477
now go down said the abb folding his arms	53.29473091208463
understanding he had nothing more to fear from him caderousse began to go down	57.31940929323857
then the count brought the taper to the window that it might be seen in the cham	23.78870553763124
what are you doing reverend sir suppose a watchman should pass and he blew out t	132.21387436671702
he then descended but it was only when he felt his foot touch the ground that he	54.968044877618496
monte cristo returned to his bedroom and glancing rapidly from the garden to the	45.93663185582906
the count then looking over into the street saw the man who appeared to be waiti	40.009005130439256
caderousse climbed the ladder slowly and looked over the coping to see if the st	41.99891223240321
no one could be seen or heard	52.1402297687894
the clock of the invalides struck one	42.67065420579935
then caderousse sat astride the coping and drawing up his ladder passed it over 	97.04245687261614
but once started he could not stop	191.97281676467125
in vain did he see a man start from the shadow when he was halfway downin vain d	133.38522970329643
before he could defend himself that arm struck him so violently in the back that	144.45087599941894
this time caderousse endeavored to call again but he could only utter a groan an	82.2129803917997
the assassin finding that he no longer cried out lifted his head up by the hair 	182.55731011690835
the murderer supposing him dead let fall his head and disappeared	197.20956571999332
then caderousse feeling that he was leaving him raised himself on his elbow and 	49.1276403276184
murder i am dying help reverend sirhelp	482.60741139022804
this mournful appeal pierced the darkness	226.02804064960023

ali and his master conveyed the wounded man into a room	71.1968496002479
monte cristo motioned to ali to undress him and he then examined his dreadful wo	66.27781896563704

ali obeyed leaving the abb alone with caderousse who had not yet revived	79.54161213228025
when the wretched man again opened his eyes the count looked at him with a mourn	45.18117997166525
a surgeon reverend sira surgeon said caderousse	266.1436898263732

i have also sent for the procureur	54.40266985616877
he will not come in time i feel my life fast ebbing	62.08721182954872
wait a moment said monte cristo	16.49171074900756
he left the room and returned in five minutes with a phial	31.896963724272023
the dying mans eyes were all the time riveted on the door through which he hoped	72.67426821889168
hasten reverend sir hasten i shall faint again monte cristo approached and dropp	179.6666983174059
caderousse drew a deep breath	88.43841909769924

the abb made him smell the contents of the phial and he again opened his eyes	53.18783720517805
his desire for revenge had not forsaken him	127.58472223211565
ah you will tell all i have said will you not reverend sir	70.56892483991706

remember my words if you return home safely i shall believe god has forgiven you	118.34181961442144
and you did not warn me cried caderousse raising himself on his elbows	25.96900336069023
you knew i should be killed on leaving this house and did not warn me	53.92264378673053
40168 m	4.011010051336912

gods justice speak not of it reverend sir	204.6769878253831
if god were just you know how many would be punished who now escape	188.97699895263995
patience said the abb in a tone which made the dying man shudder have patience	38.10118704263807
caderousse looked at him with amazement	7.95481525061412
besides said the abb god is merciful to all as he has been to you he is first a 	61.2543032067409
do you then believe in god said caderousse	43.15549892674761
had i been so unhappy as not to believe in him until now said monte cristo i mus	51.79576048129852
caderousse raised his clenched hands towards heaven	57.956977373755116
listen said the abb extending his hand over the wounded man as if to command him	31.526998938194154
instead of improving these gifts rarely granted so abundantly this has been your	335.16737421802094
help cried caderousse i require a surgeon not a priest perhaps i am not mortally	81.91495788220084
your wounds are so far mortal that without the three drops i gave you you would 	115.32899915440635
listen then	50.31197748756574
ah murmured caderousse what a strange priest you are you drive the dying to desp	77.8552060629613
listen continued the abb	30.746502354371533
when you had betrayed your friend god began not to strike but to warn you	171.95864127121072
poverty overtook you	1417.10252517306
you had already passed half your life in coveting that which you might have hono	81.44322554760764
but this unexpected unhopedfor unheardof fortune sufficed you no longer when you	309.1858364859316
it was not i who wished to kill the jew said caderousse it was la carconte	20.72869919451029

pardieu to transport me for life how merciful	510.7486108577909
you thought it a mercy then miserable wretch the coward who feared death rejoice	537.6170847099283
and you said truly the way was opened for you unexpectedly	126.89263694709095
an englishman visited toulon who had vowed to rescue two men from infamy and his	60.47632744291537
you received a second fortune money and tranquillity were restored to you and yo	166.82585967524642

god is wearied he has punished you	106.36842134622266
caderousse was fast sinking	902.0124947075817
give me drink said he i thirsti burn monte cristo gave him a glass of water	47.44076174231898
and yet that villain benedetto will escape	184.6295461298152
no one i tell you will escape benedetto will be punished	60.294004663749696
then you too will be punished for you did not do your duty as a priestyou should	73.90835854642415

i do not believe there is a god howled caderousse you do not believe it you liey	26.715272482595648
silence said the abb you will force the last drop of blood from your veins	57.10590748461872
what you do not believe in god when he is striking you dead you will not believe	65.46971675267383
reflect then wretched man and repent	923.4761994226678
no said caderousse no i will not repent	33.042051505113506
there is no god there is no providenceall comes by chance	89.65618337855815
there is a providence there is a god said monte cristo of whom you are a strikin	27.241222769405972
but who are you then asked caderousse fixing his dying eyes on the count	28.44373846314227
look well at me said monte cristo putting the light near his face	38.326800249487874
well the abbthe abb busoni	123.23970252238328
monte cristo took off the wig which disfigured him and let fall his black hair w	51.91665056173817
oh said caderousse thunderstruck but for that black hair i should say you were t	68.17317395125758
i am neither the abb busoni nor lord wilmore said monte cristo think againdo you	48.90816299472688
there was a magic effect in the counts words which once more revived the exhaust	139.7054910499086
yes indeed said he i think i have seen you and known you formerly	36.942154741206885
yes caderousse you have seen me you knew me once	51.299558802285745
who then are you and why if you knew me do you let me die	42.866248756508966
because nothing can save you your wounds are mortal	230.44318559939165
had it been possible to save you i should have considered it another proof of go	85.46946843436798
by your fathers tomb said caderousse supported by a supernatural power and halfr	88.82787734714118
the count had watched the approach of death	83.87471103381125
he knew this was the last struggle	69.79165123863156
he approached the dying man and leaning over him with a calm and melancholy look	47.2032329607797
and his almost closed lips uttered a name so low that the count himself appeared	271.2694744815835

albert said the journalist these are questions which it is difficult to answer	63.80081791701157

albert turned frightfully pale he endeavored to speak but the words died on his 	80.55021104549002

count may i suggest one idea to you	130.2448004465219
it is that next to you bertuccio must be the richest gentleman in europe	59.572068408405926
you are mistaken viscount i believe he has not a franc in his possession	60.22326265790843

monte cristo watched and saw him approach the valet who drew a small sealed parc	64.75465950675724

a great misfortune more important to me than life	144.40707525069234

at eight oclock in the morning albert had arrived at beauchamps door	12.290105971588702
the valet de chambre had received orders to usher him in at once	47.15127875746246
beauchamp was in his bath	24.311220576974165
here i am albert said	19.64586977126584
well my poor friend replied beauchamp i expected you	26.739034601171884
i need not say i think you are too faithful and too kind to have spoken of that 	64.37352302799857
your having sent for me is another proof of your affection	138.645463378687
so without losing time tell me have you the slightest idea whence this terrible 	197.70387764752738
i think i have some clew	69.4995399558971
but first tell me all the particulars of this shameful plot	88.53732253798583
beauchamp proceeded to relate to the young man who was overwhelmed with shame an	32.41945844927418
two days previously the article had appeared in another paper besides   limparti	140.33637309799903
beauchamp was breakfasting when he read the paragraph	99.85096290275402

although professing diametrically opposite principles from those of the editor o	618.5801771457544
the editor was reading with apparent delight a leading article in the same paper	184.92647346699556

what is it	5.31367304085213
the article relative to morcerf	150.33835165117077
indeed is it not a curious affair	52.05122384849816
so curious that i think you are running a great risk of a prosecution for defama	47.670119734955804
not at all we have received with the information all the requisite proofs and we	71.15089707932692
de morcerf will not raise his voice against us besides it is rendering a service	68.86950603894559

this news was brought to us	66.59416635924192
a man arrived yesterday from yanina bringing a formidable array of documents and	120.7730741335733
beauchamp understood that nothing remained but to submit and left the office to 	137.23309827600815
but he had been unable to send to albert the following particulars as the events	53.34968923025409
everyone had arrived almost before the usual hour and was conversing on the mela	76.80095239210671
some were perusing the article others making comments and recalling circumstance	564.5207140834347
the count of morcerf was no favorite with his colleagues	42.011480830495685

business had already been going on for half an hour when he entered	56.726359803145755
everyone held the accusing paper but as usual no one liked to take upon himself 	168.23726434715178

beauchamp related to the young man all the facts we have just narrated his story	84.98188580561865
albert listened trembling now with hope then with anger and then again with sham	260.0417089533016
beauchamp hesitated to continue his narrative	95.09980054717633
what next asked albert	47.886530149028715
what next my friend you impose a painful task on me	205.66323771288634

muster up all your courage then for never have you required it more	164.45991371043428
albert passed his hand over his forehead as if to try his strength as a man who 	28.47081637299486
he thought himself strong enough for he mistook fever for energy	243.54813388587576

he held some papers in his hand his countenance was calm and his step firm and h	67.46206868613154
his presence produced a good effect	180.30505621982596
the committee was made up of liberals several of whom came forward to shake hand	181.86110849781298
albert felt his heart bursting at these particulars but gratitude mingled with h	108.10439304334867
at this moment one of the doorkeepers brought in a letter for the president	32.24688900536821
you are at liberty to speak m	34.32440047492715

and what effect did this discourse produce anxiously inquired albert	248.21992022832046
i acknowledge it affected me and indeed all the committee also said beauchamp	224.10733487254782
meanwhile the president carelessly opened the letter which had been brought to h	42.4688739116974

the president frowned imperceptibly	558.9370919633815
gentlemen said he you have heard the comte de morcerfs defence	19.30093115834402
can you sir produce any witnesses to the truth of what you have assertedalas no 	68.22621431052617

it only remained to put it to the vote when the president resumed gentlemen and 	110.7234906693501
he is doubtless come to prove the perfect innocence of our colleague	159.08610715179827
here is a letter i have just received on the subject shall it be read or shall i	62.21390438397552
de morcerf turned pale and clenched his hands on the papers he held	26.321722890359958
the committee decided to hear the letter the count was thoughtful and silent	91.1108461406808

proceed was heard on all sides	112.32740927846427
the president resumed	308.09764894320216
i was on the spot at the death of ali pasha	26.83445456300336
i was present during his last moments	247.10887879547406

i shall be in the lobby when this note is delivered to you	41.71942327835326

we shall know sir replied the president	34.714833109918914
is the committee willing to hear this witnessyes yes they all said at once	193.0200400155127
the doorkeeper was called	205.51863845581124
is there anyone in the lobby said the president	36.62977921651687
yes sir	24.642404696655092

everyone looked at his neighbor	137.48369197354836
bring her in said the president	82.24615214669414
five minutes after the doorkeeper again appeared all eyes were fixed on the door	59.5663022337983
behind the doorkeeper walked a woman enveloped in a large veil which completely 	67.36967996443316
it was evident from her figure and the perfumes she had about her that she was y	42.122467746906324
the president requested her to throw aside her veil and it was then seen that sh	97.36746934969796

but it is a glorious day for me continued the young girl raising her ardent gaze	31.034229733042082
the count had not uttered one word the whole of this time	41.05154577968136
his colleagues looked at him and doubtless pitied his prospects blighted under t	133.40679287455367

tell me satisfy my impatience	254.32678497034937
well i will tell you what i did not like to mention on my return from yanina	23.8161268362054
say on	267.29774065066016
i went of course to the chief banker of the town to make inquiries	97.27368269574048
at the first word before i had even mentioned your fathers name	108.05017794498875
ah said he	8.820800092551549
i guess what brings you here	224.03628243976863
how and why	477.4313188893261
because a fortnight since i was questioned on the same subject	61.03522453994156

act prudently	4363.280832835827
oh do not fear besides you will accompany me	33.556955255102324
beauchamp solemn transactions should be sanctioned by a witness	307.94695367893826
before this day closes if m	181.77909164269238
danglars is guilty he shall cease to live or i shall die	70.6306994022648

when such resolutions are made albert they should be promptly executed	221.50527740277178
do you wish to go to m	15.466793687308877
danglars let us go immediately	34.193068669082216
they sent for a cabriolet	43.160798124531745
on entering the bankers mansion they perceived the phaeton and servant of m	123.89443525373912
andrea cavalcanti	17.00141839911708

what is your errand then with me sir	47.08807512159935
i mean said albert drawing near and without apparently noticing cavalcanti who s	126.83922040247955
danglars turned pale cavalcanti moved a step forward and albert turned towards h	58.83618749265722
and you too said he come if you like monsieur you have a claim being almost one 	134.93481796777405
cavalcanti looked at danglars with a stupefied air and the latter making an effo	21.812767226811385
alberts attack on andrea had placed him on a different footing and he hoped this	150.68974079015214
indeed sir said he to albert if you are come to quarrel with this gentleman beca	19.59394676933399
you mistake sir said morcerf with a gloomy smile i am not referring in the least	25.787941959162684
cavalcanti because he appeared disposed to interfere between us	557.2451113599171
in one respect you are right for i am ready to quarrel with everyone today but y	47.437651385558866
40212 m	1.3677573120601652
sir replied danglars pale with anger and fear i warn you when i have the misfort	19.194036252055035
now if you are mad and try to bite me i will kill you without pity	62.2070816008039
is it my fault that your father has dishonored himself	37.58000008726278
yes miserable wretch cried morcerf it is your fault	63.42372296622966
danglars retreated a few steps	31.451494824958726
my fault said he you must be mad what do i know of the grecian affair have i tra	44.392331476852505
silence said albert with a thundering voice	19.362217065535066
no it is not you who have directly made this exposure and brought this sorrow on	102.61345326141866
yes you how came it known	380.3393501502164
i suppose you read it in the paper in the account from yanina	80.8140534230431
who wrote to yanina	29.053472237283664
to yanina	9.714583740927115
who wrote for particulars concerning my father	394.0102839469352
i imagine anyone may write to yanina	362.6004310041092
but one person only wrote	571.4287267609946
one only	766.3914842532789
yes and that was you	53.25442857980921
i doubtless wrote	4962.493334635993
it appears to me that when about to marry your daughter to a young man it is rig	64.20482608824703
you wrote sir knowing what answer you would receive	441.8871088196234
i indeed i assure you cried danglars with a confidence and security proceeding l	89.02560513395184
who then urged you to write tell me	90.17531449730424
pardieu it was the most simple thing in the world	18.26785182512444
i was speaking of your fathers past history	129.36273449619054
i said the origin of his fortune remained obscure	118.95720077390062
the person to whom i addressed my scruples asked me where your father had acquir	122.82499017303782
then said he write to yanina	29.778542960790322
and who thus advised you	110.38699928297761
no other than your friend monte cristo	87.58472923418817
the count of monte cristo told you to write to yanina	14.240938036017688
yes and i wrote and will show you my correspondence if you like	62.296341160459434
albert and beauchamp looked at each other	6.184350333071877
sir said beauchamp who had not yet spoken you appear to accuse the count who is 	30.24016071699261
i accuse no one sir said danglars i relate and i will repeat before the count wh	80.94911623406001
does the count know what answer you received	166.54695644390225
yes i showed it to him	48.73231132885777
did he know my fathers christian name was fernand and his family name mondego	40.88780615468257
yes i had told him that long since and i did only what any other would have done	51.81952554539731
when the day after the arrival of this answer your father came by the advice of 	64.11396316072138
in short why should i have any more to do with the affair how did the honor or d	45.08072411669577
de morcerf affect me it neither increased nor decreased my income	234.8899098676122
albert felt the blood mounting to his brow there was no doubt upon the subject	67.84159373092254
danglars defended himself with the baseness but at the same time with the assura	25.892657060814475
besides what was morcerf seeking it was not whether danglars or monte cristo was	62.33437543558364
in addition to this everything forgotten or unperceived before presented itself 	510.59179265512995
monte cristo knew everything as he had bought the daughter of ali pasha and know	75.45618311215915
the answer known he had yielded to alberts wish to be introduced to hayde and al	61.93224318030079
besides had he not begged of morcerf not to mention his fathers name before hayd	66.9701500070273
there could be no doubt that all had been calculated and previously arranged mon	153.2695218381488
albert took beauchamp aside and communicated these ideas to him	123.79805832704908
you are right said the latter m	26.46619286011424
danglars has only been a secondary agent in this sad affair and it is of m	72.5479610749938
de monte cristo that you must demand an explanation	55.916233053036244
albert turned	43.797867240699375
sir said he to danglars understand that i do not take a final leave of you i mus	28.843745538718643
he bowed to the banker and went out with beauchamp without appearing to notice c	68.3425856495907
danglars accompanied him to the door where he again assured albert that no motiv	44.59300036840722
chapter 88	1875.4589766280421
the insult	17312.49689651475
at the bankers door beauchamp stopped morcerf	39.59744443389121
listen said he just now i told you it was of m	46.849329770748064
de monte cristo you must demand an explanation	53.755977505224934
yes and we are going to his house	32.41429562039637
reflect morcerf one moment before you go	158.51599500475552
on what shall i reflect	110.80762836076363
on the importance of the step you are taking	72.5467503103715
is it more serious than going to m	89.10850750888095
yes m	208.75727602283663
danglars is a moneylover and those who love money you know think too much of wha	76.36100093924712
the other is on the contrary to all appearance a true nobleman but do you not fe	62.5739590037351
i only fear one thing namely to find a man who will not fight	59.04711957467678
do not be alarmed said beauchamp he will meet you	17.974955626249525
my only fear is that he will be too strong for you	47.25906391788119
my friend said morcerf with a sweet smile that is what i wish	13.132576406506342
the happiest thing that could occur to me would be to die in my fathers stead th	47.97747318864902
your mother would die of grief	142.35697106291576
my poor mother said albert passing his hand across his eyes i know she would but	34.98930716583462
are you quite decided albert	41.94727526559567
yes let us go	12.408309098896117
but do you think we shall find the count at home	27.225795462294023
he intended returning some hours after me and doubtless he is now at home	157.5002839864351
they ordered the driver to take them to no	97.35368108313885
30 champslyses	8.818640532177398
beauchamp wished to go in alone but albert observed that as this was an unusual 	97.52936042835525
the cause which the young man espoused was one so sacred that beauchamp had only	88.87846532727369
albert sprang from the porters lodge to the steps	57.983016371470036
he was received by baptistin	31.78035202528388
the count had indeed just arrived but he was in his bath and had forbidden that 	50.200329251172796
but after his bath asked morcerf	86.6146263318587
my master will go to dinner	84.07812976885869
and after dinner	612.9979941950384
he will sleep an hour	167.86912885842065
he is going to the opera	20.734309244984892
are you sure of it asked albert	5.807443701340937
quite sir my master has ordered his horses at eight oclock precisely	82.00594027444558
very good replied albert that is all i wished to know	15.248288656749876
then turning towards beauchamp if you have anything to attend to beauchamp do it	33.26539919774856
i depend on you to accompany me to the opera and if you can bring chteaurenaud w	28.996319361156818
beauchamp availed himself of alberts permission and left him promising to call f	141.8065042039216
on his return home albert expressed his wish to franz debray and morrel to see t	25.47978102674202
then he went to see his mother who since the events of the day before had refuse	70.66206183058364
he found her in bed overwhelmed with grief at this public humiliation	106.27412319641698
the sight of albert produced the effect which might naturally be expected on mer	72.9693536024692
albert stood one moment speechless by the side of his mothers bed	69.31506306968238
it was evident from his pale face and knit brows that his resolution to revenge 	114.25582769830318
my dear mother said he do you know if m	27.154234030522264
de morcerf has any enemy	73.03573688999042

my son she said persons in the counts situation have many secret enemies	256.48985184833384
those who are known are not the most dangerous	94.56178815476487
i know it and appeal to your penetration	77.72167338900809
you are of so superior a mind nothing escapes you	172.3622077553556
why do you say so	10.17495310959883
because for instance you noticed on the evening of the ball we gave that m	72.28269945111049
de monte cristo would eat nothing in our house	53.28200056583017
mercds raised herself on her feverish arm	139.78332110804513

mother replied the young man you have special reasons for telling me to concilia	27.075939613061486

the conduct of the son in seeking to avenge his father was so natural that chtea	81.98947936187581
debray was not yet come but albert knew that he seldom lost a scene at the opera	70.3995666134558
albert wandered about the theatre until the curtain was drawn up	104.65673322062807
he hoped to meet with m	102.56194300185565
de monte cristo either in the lobby or on the stairs	22.813179322589914
the bell summoned him to his seat and he entered the orchestra with chteaurenaud	42.19292649000403

without communicating his thoughts to his companion he sat down drew out his ope	74.67979201782522
although apparently not noticing albert he did not however lose sight of him and	113.33009080827385
then his head was seen passing at the back of the boxes and the count knew that 	71.82827235291751
he was at the moment conversing cheerfully with morrel but he was well prepared 	55.25875485751966

in pronouncing these words albert had raised his voice so as to be heard by thos	42.65901733545829
thus the attention of many was attracted by this altercation	146.34392905064772

they had talked of no one but morcerf the whole day	69.12741691510126

morrel whispered what have you done to him	54.40002391663681
i nothingat least personally said monte cristo	134.7385892029007
but there must be some cause for this strange scene	81.80702788354901
the count of morcerfs adventure exasperates the young man	35.23149516621181
have you anything to do with it	11.076237900197478
it was through hayde that the chamber was informed of his fathers treason	91.60004253102086
indeed said morrel	4.776206796039583
i had been told but would not credit it that the grecian slave i have seen with 	81.16029914893268
it is true nevertheless	40.678014462799396
then said morrel i understand it all and this scene was premeditated	42.22582406748087
how so	21.03134264806101
albert wrote to request me to come to the opera doubtless that i might be a witn	30.31973181524539
probably said monte cristo with his imperturbable tranquillity	17.925239118369117

with whom	64.88373211201308

bravo bravo	123.87588631669789
morrel saw it was useless to say more and refrained	45.66713745335001

de morcerf as you saw	35.90971807961497
and that means replied monte cristo laughing that you had probably just dined to	93.17848164261216
i am happy to see m	26.84524347693004
beauchamp that you are more sober than he was	59.40382939198614

beauchamp albert was wrong i acknowledge to betray so much anger and i come on m	116.4427849265398
and having done so entirely on my own account be it understood i would add that 	137.2649702048787
then i will add two words about the young greek girl	94.24533211995852

how so asked beauchamp	13.086898860968649
doubtless you wish to make me appear a very eccentric character	111.52312493608986

you bring me down to your own level and demand explanations indeed m	272.12609539693943
beauchamp it is quite laughable	71.86979582231336
yet replied beauchamp haughtily there are occasions when probity commands	309.6182597224823
beauchamp interposed this strange man the count of monte cristo bows to none but	81.39108662926031

i do what i please m	105.41868641822703
beauchamp and it is always well done	135.14183593123846

the lion was daunted the avenger was conquered	170.44236711530792

but the count did not answer	15.378658369946093
mercds opened the door of the study and had disappeared before he had recovered 	30.94573667754616

the meeting	3547.538717931084
after mercds had left monte cristo he fell into profound gloom	60.13542499104257
around him and within him the flight of thought seemed to have stopped his energ	105.3436636789585
what said he to himself while the lamp and the wax lights were nearly burnt out 	80.73324711804744

it is not gods will that they should be accomplished	71.00800287796069

yet continued the count becoming each moment more absorbed in the anticipation o	100.89226348637035
there are virtues which become crimes by exaggeration	245.5795927420148
no she must have conceived some pathetic scene she will come and throw herself b	184.8633474968136
the blush of pride mounted to the counts forehead as this thought passed through	128.8188328252499
ridiculous repeated he and the ridicule will fall on me	111.38383149032474
i ridiculous no i would rather die	244.80665382501232

he turned his head looked around him and saw no one but the sound was repeated d	50.420063209338096
he arose and quietly opening the door of the drawingroom saw hayde who had falle	39.26988106611178
she had been standing at the door to prevent his going out without seeing her un	56.3586323395532
the noise of the door did not awaken her and monte cristo gazed at her with affe	28.468304934282976
she remembered that she had a son said he and i forgot i had a daughter	53.83164761444177
then shaking his head sorrowfully poor hayde said he she wished to see me to spe	47.05678556057593
oh i can not go without taking leave of her i can not die without confiding her 	96.19291489903719
he quietly regained his seat and wrote under the other lines	96.83601953559537

he was finishing the last line when a cry behind him made him start and the pen 	125.99211312678321

the count stopped	46.230174268737265
well asked the young girl with an authoritative tone the count had never observe	50.56276264420063
well if any misfortune happen to me replied monte cristo i wish my daughter to b	32.18865696722399
hayde smiled sorrowfully and shook her head	36.49727451487497

then the effort having exhausted her strength she fell not asleep this time but 	320.7690633968825
the count leaned over her and raised her in his arms and seeing that sweet pale 	57.282550248664954
alas murmured he with intense suffering i might then have been happy yet	217.27266960035482
then he carried hayde to her room resigned her to the care of her attendants and	70.61470352640451
as he was finishing the sound of a cabriolet entering the yard was heard	35.9714055588769
monte cristo approached the window and saw maximilian and emmanuel alight	50.740912615791096
good said he it was timeand he sealed his will with three seals	127.16781876484626
a moment afterwards he heard a noise in the drawingroom and went to open the doo	22.789585898817794
morrel was there he had come twenty minutes before the time appointed	72.66622898393956
i am perhaps come too soon count said he but i frankly acknowledge that i have n	88.22966774564858
i need to see you strong in your courageous assurance to recover myself	147.405379327199
monte cristo could not resist this proof of affection he not only extended his h	72.36412204458024
morrel said he it is a happy day for me to feel that i am beloved by such a man 	23.914471459475504
goodmorning emmanuel you will come with me then maximilian	24.67436302774219
did you doubt it said the young captain	25.25675867129295
but if i were wrong	25.515824300386143
i watched you during the whole scene of that challenge yesterday i have been thi	72.6981832690697
but morrel albert is your friend	37.77104042385419
simply an acquaintance sir	285.23588305885494
you met on the same day you first saw me	90.7910883021411
yes that is true but i should not have recollected it if you had not reminded me	35.35022496182241
thank you morrel	11.193732387947918
then ringing the bell once look	375.9432172999448
said he to ali who came immediately take that to my solicitor	62.75030848592121
it is my will morrel	56.00832259981149
when i am dead you will go and examine it	30.587198728054474
what said morrel you dead	87.38120121389748
yes must i not be prepared for everything dear friend but what did you do yester	35.113172516622065
i went to tortonis where as i expected i found beauchamp and chteaurenaud	39.309514506424485
i own i was seeking them	239.25490358038783
why when all was arranged	156.7476136166959
listen count the affair is serious and unavoidable	150.7962667464432
did you doubt it	22.194467036122234
no the offence was public and everyone is already talking of it	193.91766142812654
well i hoped to get an exchange of armsto substitute the sword for the pistol th	59.882102010956295
have you succeeded asked monte cristo quickly with an imperceptible gleam of hop	32.722661999288
no for your skill with the sword is so well known	133.13886853477499
ahwho has betrayed me	83.01435131119378
the skilful swordsman whom you have conquered	225.41206476422633
and you failed	328.1615919583035
they positively refused	2350.9284466474614
morrel said the count have you ever seen me fire a pistol	41.085894520709346
well we have time look	168.13886101395414
monte cristo took the pistols he held in his hand when mercds entered and fixing	52.68509459678824
at each shot morrel turned pale	119.90191369613879
he examined the bullets with which monte cristo performed this dexterous feat an	128.36049374662645
it is astonishing said he	28.438259526203833
look emmanuel	130.927134285303
then turning towards monte cristo count said he in the name of all that is dear 	43.98693383538711
you are right said monte cristo and i have none	9.257030174376414
these words were uttered in a tone which made morrel shudder	32.00775270856944
you are the offended party count	150.14012476451026
doubtless what does that imply	253.70469168384568
that you will fire first	178.80852427140863
i fire first	5417.218239727418
oh i obtained or rather claimed that we had conceded enough for them to yield us	125.76978164679866
and at what distance	140.3243953592554
twenty paces	116.31320796043413
a smile of terrible import passed over the counts lips	69.02876462537998
morrel said he do not forget what you have just seen	21.698576644040156
the only chance for alberts safety then will arise from your emotion	377.68556245584955
i suffer from emotion said monte cristo	95.86373182569471
or from your generosity my friend to so good a marksman as you are i may say wha	72.46443114944101
what is that	7.202635580927824
break his armwound himbut do not kill him	71.41336732609878
i will tell you morrel said the count that i do not need entreating to spare the	21.10203694695944
de morcerf he shall be so well spared that he will return quietly with his two f	43.603385737272205
and you	9.321405243641477
that will be another thing i shall be brought home	57.54007440978358
no no cried maximilian quite unable to restrain his feelings	58.003258574323795
as i told you my dear morrel m	13.467695268961313
de morcerf will kill me	17.32582845408771
morrel looked at him in utter amazement	41.414700897448306
but what has happened then since last evening count	106.8321516242107
the same thing that happened to brutus the night before the battle of philippi i	32.76622440347113
and that ghost	1074.8235678901233
told me morrel that i had lived long enough	37.90657892289674
maximilian and emmanuel looked at each other	6.259922708160831
monte cristo drew out his watch	18.47483860452735
let us go said he it is five minutes past seven and the appointment was for eigh	34.657019166653704
a carriage was in readiness at the door	20.177716033482252
monte cristo stepped into it with his two friends	79.20827715698123
he had stopped a moment in the passage to listen at a door and maximilian and em	48.42121894528612
as the clock struck eight they drove up to the place of meeting	59.20813683809135
we are first said morrel looking out of the window	18.36854632279603
excuse me sir said baptistin who had followed his master with indescribable terr	36.643405573470815
monte cristo sprang lightly from the carriage and offered his hand to assist emm	37.38967640058962
the latter retained the counts hand between his	121.05443612296335
i like said he to feel a hand like this when its owner relies on the goodness of	126.49735578064417
it seems to me said emmanuel that i see two young men down there who are evident	38.319079568270325
monte cristo drew morrel a step or two behind his brotherinlaw	125.07787919322291
maximilian said he are your affections disengaged morrel looked at monte cristo 	40.04006626886982
i do not seek your confidence my dear friend	23.98394420330874
i only ask you a simple question answer itthat is all i require	141.27392834443899
i love a young girl count	111.6878335006034
do you love her much	84.16974881142063
more than my life	20.083367729706453
another hope defeated said the count	227.5046672303939
then with a sigh poor hayde murmured he	94.90781351086737
to tell the truth count if i knew less of you i should think that you were less 	71.47359761437842
because i sigh when thinking of someone i am leaving come morrel it is not like 	160.72705608776607
do i regret life what is it to me who have passed twenty years between life and 	98.22434012168412
i know the world is a drawingroom from which we must retire politely and honestl	70.98528695258582
that is to the purpose	42.64081566257656
have you brought your arms	53.635343903559225
iwhat for i hope these gentlemen have theirs	133.631090932923
i will inquire said morrel	37.69542651480509
do but make no treatyyou understand me	260.96066274128
you need not fear	166.67653395794304
morrel advanced towards beauchamp and chteaurenaud who seeing his intention came	85.62537614038291
the three young men bowed to each other courteously if not affably	31.780117138334333
excuse me gentlemen said morrel but i do not see m	15.780804678868206
de morcerf	1.0459604266686002
he sent us word this morning replied chteaurenaud that he would meet us on the g	40.63874523387324
ah said morrel	3.7826480578775703
beauchamp pulled out his watch	47.87683806431865
it is only five minutes past eight said he to morrel there is not much time lost	50.80674190092485
oh i made no allusion of that kind replied morrel	32.59262502921989
there is a carriage coming said chteaurenaud	24.55591515328679
it advanced rapidly along one of the avenues leading towards the open space wher	129.3024823274717
you are doubtless provided with pistols gentlemen m	218.19555722915376
de monte cristo yields his right of using his	55.277228893709726
we had anticipated this kindness on the part of the count said beauchamp and i h	28.361780084121246
they are quite new and have not yet been used	91.46273360307595
will you examine them	54.38214125905811
oh m	117.71794580667749
beauchamp if you assure me that m	68.18201656537629
de morcerf does not know these pistols you may readily believe that your word wi	61.64153934412004
gentlemen said chteaurenaud it is not morcerf coming in that carriagefaith it is	23.85731237354392
the two young men he announced were indeed approaching	218.2431104037255
what chance brings you here gentlemen said chteaurenaud shaking hands with each 	192.71461996534637
because said debray albert sent this morning to request us to come	55.424688698192384
beauchamp and chteaurenaud exchanged looks of astonishment	74.62386949974467
i think i understand his reason said morrel	50.31564818638044
what is it	4.969970673942876
yesterday afternoon i received a letter from m	146.3694715731631
de morcerf begging me to attend the opera	37.78120879611026
and i said debray	15.264347730819441
and i also said franz	34.24686696823282
and we too added beauchamp and chteaurenaud	32.89407564954564

exactly so said the young men you have probably guessed right	44.74429178160034
but after all these arrangements he does not come himself said chteaurenaud	44.827674779688685
albert is ten minutes after time	150.09116355440494
there he comes said beauchamp on horseback at full gallop followed by a servant	43.58770121025835
how imprudent said chteaurenaud to come on horseback to fight a duel with pistol	120.76184478320793
and besides said beauchamp with a collar above his cravat an open coat and white	74.74395335397902

morrel was preparing to fulfil his commission	74.71897340243504
beauchamp had meanwhile drawn the box of pistols from the carriage	85.02047200296022

what does he want with me said monte cristo	11.615488357824775
i do not know but he wishes to speak to you	16.417251311393514
ah said monte cristo i trust he is not going to tempt me by some fresh insult	37.96392084147464
i do not think that such is his intention said morrel	25.05665425055239
the count advanced accompanied by maximilian and emmanuel	46.176879934484525
his calm and serene look formed a singular contrast to alberts griefstricken fac	168.37835336246394
when at three paces distant from each other albert and the count stopped	68.98279701204582

hasty actions are generally bad ones	514.9506170150516
now my fault is repaired	196.01769149912437
i hope the world will not call me cowardly for acting as my conscience dictated	120.07871060808031

chteaurenaud contented himself with tapping his boot with his flexible cane	143.95050817513658
are we not going said he after this embarrassing silence	53.12056919767606
when you please replied beauchamp allow me only to compliment m	71.98747307687141
de morcerf who has given proof today of rare chivalric generosity	113.96716899548987
oh yes said chteaurenaud	5.454906943212924

well said albert	4.453412703752983
i did not like to go to him without first seeing you	75.02726219541351
because the count is doubtless aware that i accompanied you to the meeting this 	79.22599300981366
40254 m	2.8853793494897757
it is probable said albert	10.35179682034053
and since he has sent for me it is doubtless to question me on what happened the	63.680124073791674
what must i answer	69.4947679650417
the truth	295.119205216513
then i shall say the duel did not take place	54.69119816893287
you will say i apologized to the count of monte cristo	23.47098126198447

have you not thought so	25.65205437600374

it is miraculous continued morrel answering his own thoughts	101.69268718783862

how can you reconcile that with his conduct this morning	79.03781846264552
all owing to your influence replied monte cristo smiling	55.84042842534491
it is well for albert he is not in the army said morrel	20.57780025578936

his eye elate with happiness was reading eagerly the tearful gaze of hayde when 	126.57724287454343
the count knit his brow	92.29756301990221
de morcerf said baptistin as if that name sufficed for his excuse	68.48452446531809
in fact the counts face brightened	120.40942929621832
which asked he the viscount or the count	117.78274029580005
the count	21.96327893844576

i know not if it is finished my beloved child said monte cristo taking the young	40.755442452834124
but it is the wretched	41.432151991466476
that man can not injure me hayde said monte cristo it was his son alone that the	46.96689345023834
and what i have suffered said the young girl you shall never know my lord	26.04689748304751

we must explain this visit which although expected by monte cristo is unexpected	172.1622764913071
while mercds as we have said was making a similar inventory of her property to a	44.00702160462611
he who was thus looking without being heard or seen probably heard and saw all t	162.34265924649384
from that glass door the palefaced man went to the counts bedroom and raised wit	131.6419146146619
he remained there ten minutes motionless and dumb listening to the beating of hi	168.0131137091
for him those ten minutes were very long	204.20973671110175
it was then albert returning from his meeting with the count perceived his fathe	51.674289483496146
the counts eye expanded he knew albert had insulted the count dreadfully and tha	116.21840581029976

an indescribable ray of joy illumined that wretched countenance like the last ra	87.14651728563275
but as we have said he waited in vain for his son to come to his apartment with 	33.1257490813449
he easily understood why his son did not come to see him before he went to aveng	38.721802996216994
it was then when the count could not see albert that he sent for his servant who	25.75372466122239

the coachman stooped down for his orders	156.80046588732526
to the champslyses said the general the count of monte cristos	13.66136871921701
the horses bounded beneath the whip and in five minutes they stopped before the 	117.96963101006055
de morcerf opened the door himself and as the carriage rolled away he passed up 	64.67408870932825
a moment afterwards baptistin announced the count of morcerf to monte cristo and	14.623789382500318
the general was pacing the room the third time when in turning he perceived mont	116.94714585018723
ah it is m	33.67367052175793
de morcerf said monte cristo quietly i thought i had not heard aright	25.550066643514707
yes it is i said the count whom a frightful contraction of the lips prevented fr	59.5659897969286
may i know the cause which procures me the pleasure of seeing m	45.010722522745866
de morcerf so early	109.61385569286605
had you not a meeting with my son this morning asked the general	54.18203447326312
i had replied the count	49.063729270825895
and i know my son had good reasons to wish to fight with you and to endeavor to 	53.46084660478008
yes sir he had very good ones but you see that in spite of them he has not kille	44.0925206705611
yet he considered you the cause of his fathers dishonor the cause of the fearful	56.06243008857744
it is true sir said monte cristo with his dreadful calmness a secondary cause bu	50.120681020140395
doubtless you made then some apology or explanation	331.5232897773559
i explained nothing and it is he who apologized to me	64.59897769511082
but to what do you attribute this conduct	130.9577914570178
to the conviction probably that there was one more guilty than i	153.04633794355172
and who was that	53.50394564794061
his father	55.06332500884879
that may be said the count turning pale but you know the guilty do not like to f	36.265661670410076
i know it and i expected this result	78.03115079658274
you expected my son would be a coward cried the count	66.21341028301491
albert de morcerf is no coward said monte cristo	20.185299188070083
a man who holds a sword in his hand and sees a mortal enemy within reach of that	131.84287469709008
sir replied monte cristo coldly i did not expect that you had come here to relat	15.907400314776268
go and tell m	54.069003741687474
albert that and he may know what to answer you	127.39013110398778
oh no no said the general smiling faintly i did not come for that purpose you ar	42.72353816135362
i came to tell you that i also look upon you as my enemy	47.09481160659669
i came to tell you that i hate you instinctively that it seems as if i had alway	26.931711093268806
do you think so sir	13.52182153550052
and when i told you i had foreseen the result it is the honor of your visit i al	38.5683489560085
so much the better	4.9224348020240525
are you prepared	40.55102834072361
yes sir	24.786532109426986
you know that we shall fight till one of us is dead said the general whose teeth	44.9836017364557

until one of us dies repeated monte cristo moving his head slightly up and down	49.76475037257477
let us start then we need no witnesses	57.2626960861504
very true said monte cristo it is unnecessary we know each other so well	28.414870646766573
on the contrary said the count we know so little of each other	21.834256154652653
indeed said monte cristo with the same indomitable coolness let us see	17.733540034136293
are you not the soldier fernand who deserted on the eve of the battle of waterlo	21.5846184714256

but it is your real name i want to know in the midst of your hundred names that 	40.712933963795784
the count of monte cristo turned dreadfully pale his eye seemed to burn with a d	45.10601069519832
he leaped towards a dressingroom near his bedroom and in less than a moment tear	121.90990165740297
he returned thus formidable and implacable advancing with his arms crossed on hi	180.1606741257777

the general with his head thrown back hands extended gaze fixed looked silently 	443.61850986360673
edmond dants	16.84780563481668
then with sighs which were unlike any human sound he dragged himself to the door	165.18832416810457
the fresh air and the shame he felt at having exposed himself before his servant	167.71439079436723
he stopped at a short distance from the house and alighted	26.956790426424444
the door was wide open a hackneycoach was standing in the middle of the yarda st	32.983885531870044
two persons were coming down the stairs he had only time to creep into an alcove	59.05080810763036
it was mercds leaning on her sons arm and leaving the house	63.118403220221744
they passed close by the unhappy being who concealed behind the damask curtain a	174.0603178781233
courage mother come this is no longer our home	304.63934718783014
the words died away the steps were lost in the distance	115.70366985948003
the general drew himself up clinging to the curtain he uttered the most dreadful	93.35708734599676
he soon heard the clatter of the iron step of the hackneycoach then the coachman	70.91924557182533
he darted to his bedroom to see once more all he had loved in the world but the 	69.71963883414622

chapter 93	3074.8740215981943
we may easily conceive where morrels appointment was	270.03903756871534
on leaving monte cristo he walked slowly towards villeforts we say slowly for mo	97.06536493348821
he knew his time wellthe hour when valentine was giving noirtier his breakfast a	160.39378541373205
noirtier and valentine had given him leave to go twice a week and he was now ava	34.747549605172146
he arrived valentine was expecting him	158.08543645398137
uneasy and almost crazed she seized his hand and led him to her grandfather	46.24750430836022
this uneasiness amounting almost to frenzy arose from the report morcerfs advent	245.15266099312353
no one at villeforts doubted that a duel would ensue from it	96.74735795022909
valentine with her womans instinct guessed that morrel would be monte cristos se	65.51924785198409
we may easily understand how eagerly the particulars were asked for given and re	230.2376845553834
now said valentine motioning to morrel to sit down near her grandfather while sh	33.968173191050944
you know maximilian grandpapa once thought of leaving this house and taking an a	194.12961941495772
de villeforts	1.0580819853149803
yes said maximilian i recollect the project of which i highly approved	51.54440191082106
well said valentine you may approve again for grandpapa is again thinking of it	114.41704290023696
bravo said maximilian	2.7697586995118546
40272 m	1.069094773453864
and do you know said valentine what reason grandpapa gives for leaving this hous	88.97641834635543
noirtier looked at valentine to impose silence but she did not notice him her lo	29.50145158433378
oh whatever may be m	222.32059133135002
noirtiers reason answered morrel i can readily believe it to be a good one	62.25919102395475
an excellent one said valentine	23.266384909726753
he pretends the air of the faubourg sainthonor is not good for me	33.35433814868086
indeed said morrel in that m	43.19668514766569
noirtier may be right you have not seemed to be well for the last fortnight	85.67467136353073
not very said valentine	37.31142761831981
and grandpapa has become my physician and i have the greatest confidence in him 	104.00338896394635
do you then really suffer asked morrel quickly	77.91154393199481
oh it must not be called suffering i feel a general uneasiness that is all	73.95736151410597
i have lost my appetite and my stomach feels as if it were struggling to get acc	48.37289463283935
noirtier did not lose a word of what valentine said	23.61407804350696
and what treatment do you adopt for this singular complaint	157.34444940383375
a very simple one said valentine	25.861155417886206
i swallow every morning a spoonful of the mixture prepared for my grandfather	183.09153332015
when i say one spoonful i began by onenow i take four	239.7288277013264
grandpapa says it is a panacea	61.73802373924715
valentine smiled but it was evident that she suffered	30.95031139956654
maximilian in his devotedness gazed silently at her	89.88095225718166
she was very beautiful but her usual pallor had increased her eyes were more bri	60.72017622314298
from valentine the young man looked towards noirtier	21.803366624377478
the latter watched with strange and deep interest the young girl absorbed by her	119.33375696850558
but said morrel i thought this mixture of which you now take four spoonfuls was 	105.48299821972999
i know it is very bitter said valentine so bitter that all i drink afterwards ap	71.21355461699287
noirtier looked inquiringly at his granddaughter	48.18909733729171
yes grandpapa said valentine it is so	22.616123307173073

noirtier turned pale and made a sign that he wished to speak	16.15442712634209
valentine rose to fetch the dictionary	51.37288568922195
noirtier watched her with evident anguish	164.37947385559465
in fact the blood was rushing to the young girls head already her cheeks were be	129.98471396705028
oh cried she without losing any of her cheerfulness this is singular i ca nt see	66.68049944724572
the sun is not shining said morrel more alarmed by noirtiers expression than by 	96.84156069561178
he ran towards her	155.5031002139186
the young girl smiled	27.381454783984918
cheer up said she to noirtier	16.1154468242824
do not be alarmed maximilian it is nothing and has already passed away	37.735018330056505
but listen do i not hear a carriage in the courtyard she opened noirtiers door r	61.47062143934547

40274 m	1.4368413569289493
morrel watched her as she left the room he heard her ascend the little staircase	67.41061884139532
as soon as she was gone noirtier made a sign to morrel to take the dictionary	20.193092211044036
morrel obeyed guided by valentine he had learned how to understand the old man q	55.4589242410127
accustomed however as he was to the work he had to repeat most of the letters of	68.19274627682425
fetch the glass of water and the decanter from valentines room	69.25899651697499
morrel rang immediately for the servant who had taken barroiss situation and in 	67.15856884639749
the servant soon returned	146.5668435092823
the decanter and the glass were completely empty	172.29162211451532
noirtier made a sign that he wished to speak	13.623810430088913
why are the glass and decanter empty asked he valentine said she only drank half	289.70987344380364
the translation of this new question occupied another five minutes	241.82296521088531
i do not know said the servant but the housemaid is in mademoiselle valentines r	27.701801310478526
ask her said morrel translating noirtiers thought this time by his look	108.2866662957959
the servant went out but returned almost immediately	190.28859331611656
mademoiselle valentine passed through the room to go to madame de villeforts sai	18.959232600432962
noirtier raised his eyes to heaven as a gambler does who stakes his all on one s	72.42954028117865
from that moment the old mans eyes were fixed on the door and did not quit it	19.651242985516777
it was indeed madame danglars and her daughter whom valentine had seen they had 	44.0232978478258
that is why valentine passed through her room which was on a level with valentin	64.95189551308363
the two ladies entered the drawingroom with that sort of official stiffness whic	53.71473726442897
among worldly people manner is contagious	776.4544260541397
madame de villefort received them with equal solemnity	79.28211305444326
valentine entered at this moment and the formalities were resumed	78.20197409055811
my dear friend said the baroness while the two young people were shaking hands i	40.91451577704288
danglars kept up the title of prince	239.40702806478401

danglars assures me that his fortune is majesticthat is his word	100.82618312220843
and then said eugnie while turning over the leaves of madame de villeforts album	42.60020006651042
and said madame de villefort i need not ask you if you share that fancy	46.889312189833035

the general depended much on it he even came to force m	372.34302526360864
we have had a narrow escape	55.65870402136493
but said valentine timidly does all the fathers shame revert upon the son monsie	177.35062748495457
excuse me said the implacable young girl monsieur albert claims and well deserve	126.58834900058369

debray who was present at the explanation	75.48245331181013
valentine also knew the truth but she did not answer	53.70427529827365

oh yes very gloomy my friend	74.88165311964597
someone had just died in the house to which that garden belonged	77.9169681842092
one of the persons whose conversation i overheard was the master of the house th	56.23908986752374
the former was confiding to the latter his grief and fear for it was the second 	102.71841262586125

and what did the doctor answer asked monte cristo	17.78256798604771
he repliedhe replied that the death was not a natural one and must be attributed	93.04390866774503
to what	131.04599425096026
to poison	8817.407280571251
indeed said monte cristo with a slight cough which in moments of extreme emotion	53.94204722255413
yes my dear count i heard it and the doctor added that if another death occurred	78.8408045399854
monte cristo listened or appeared to do so with the greatest calmness	83.76767390777859
well said maximilian death came a third time and neither the master of the house	75.55108684617622

if it is gods justice instead of his anger which is walking through that house m	121.46502368139994
morrel shuddered	358.0823736380015
there was something mournful solemn and terrible in the counts manner	109.69594711359403

morrel subdued by the extraordinary ascendancy monte cristo exercised over every	291.59446471240074
he pressed the counts hand and left	30.32180654820508
he stopped one moment at the door for baptistin whom he saw in the rue matignon 	28.25771533376405
meanwhile villefort and davrigny had made all possible haste valentine had not r	43.044663560473246

noirtier paler than even the young girl more eager than villefort for the decisi	40.381957669674144
at last davrigny slowly uttered these words she is still alive	87.59258115296439
still cried villefort oh doctor what a dreadful word is that	83.01819107974872
yes said the physician i repeat it she is still alive and i am astonished at it	48.429381607604924
but is she safe asked the father	108.82785922387134
yes since she lives	199.49453801914632
at that moment davrignys glance met noirtiers eye	88.50359687267925
it glistened with such extraordinary joy so rich and full of thought that the ph	156.85715049355036
he placed the young girl again on the chairher lips were scarcely discernible th	110.26368796432648
sir said davrigny to villefort call mademoiselle valentines maid if you please	38.978626531643336
villefort went himself to find her and davrigny approached noirtier	49.89851607519575
have you something to tell me asked he	22.372956621034067
the old man winked his eyes expressively which we may remember was his only way 	150.70641194879113
well i will remain with you	25.036124150385607
at this moment villefort returned followed by the ladys maid and after her came 	55.82062160629884
what is the matter then with this dear child she has just left me and she compla	35.356024004903226
the young woman with tears in her eyes and every mark of affection of a true mot	100.00882827218312
davrigny continued to look at noirtier he saw the eyes of the old man dilate and	21.048167211629682
ah said he involuntarily following noirtiers eyes which were fixed on madame de 	50.33723395271882
this poor child would be better in bed	73.65455771838758
come fanny we will put her to bed	74.80717102435518
davrigny who saw that would be a means of his remaining alone with noirtier expr	48.05800065693806
they carried valentine away she had revived but could scarcely move or speak so 	273.4305734234075
she had however just power to give one parting look to her grandfather who in lo	139.6996288972006
davrigny followed the invalid wrote a prescription ordered villefort to take a c	141.41013794053598
then having renewed his injunction not to give valentine anything he went down a	143.72588449632582
do you said he know anything of this young ladys illness	77.22959081685028
yes said the old man	6.905598065504431
we have no time to lose i will question and do you answer me	50.140521450630054
noirtier made a sign that he was ready to answer	14.958102469645114
did you anticipate the accident which has happened to your granddaughter	64.67081985702163
davrigny reflected a moment then approaching noirtier	114.53369340557684
pardon what i am going to say added he but no indication should be neglected in 	40.68998404218979
did you see poor barrois die noirtier raised his eyes to heaven	44.00456652368578
do you know of what he died asked davrigny placing his hand on noirtiers shoulde	15.068158071063849
yes replied the old man	7.481749605268318
do you think he died a natural death a sort of smile was discernible on the moti	45.591811866364445
then you have thought that barrois was poisoned	42.97626610049853
do you think the poison he fell a victim to was intended for him	86.12634234719722
do you think the same hand which unintentionally struck barrois has now attacked	160.80869909025358
then will she die too asked davrigny fixing his penetrating gaze on noirtier	62.43149774566295
he watched the effect of this question on the old man	43.67883129368263
no replied he with an air of triumph which would have puzzled the most clever di	45.76010569256675
then you hope said davrigny with surprise	44.167053975510655
what do you hope the old man made him understand with his eyes that he could not	27.715700925558835
ah yes it is true murmured davrigny	12.50819010786453
then turning to noirtierdo you hope the assassin will be tried	45.43919311787133
then you hope the poison will take no effect on valentine	81.65437368304316
it is no news to you added davrigny to tell you that an attempt has been made to	35.153362593294254
then how do you hope valentine will escape	63.85980416788749
noirtier kept his eyes steadfastly fixed on the same spot	32.88283918241816
davrigny followed the direction and saw that they were fixed on a bottle contain	59.787776817199685
ah indeed said davrigny struck with a sudden thought has it occurred to younoirt	65.64749669803422
yes said he	10.192743197404907
to prepare her system to resist poison	688.5942724000689
by accustoming her by degrees	97.39407647332617
yes yes yes said noirtier delighted to be understood	30.85814337982396
of course	9.656194076705594
i had told you that there was brucine in the mixture i give you	47.19732491348279
and by accustoming her to that poison you have endeavored to neutralize the effe	77.89750207445874
and you have succeeded exclaimed davrigny	38.231419759262785

do you understand me	9.916931750830635

the greater the amount the more flattering it is to you it gives you an idea of 	136.95605273364197

do you expect to recover your position sir without touching those three million	180.51151709663634
i hope so if the marriage should take place and confirm my credit	83.87375116941115
shall you be able to pay m	34.30883884432667
cavalcanti the five hundred thousand francs you promise for my dowry	170.365093772758

but what are you up to	27.88645184810287
ah that is my affair	35.15146010902636
what advantage should i have over you if knowing your secret i were to tell you 	154.00908949744948
danglars bit his lips	41.93336616754697
then said he you are ready to pay the official visits which are absolutely indis	71.8135804386851
yes replied eugnie	5.458851639947252
and to sign the contract in three days	125.70694700101754
then in my turn i also say very well	72.18233213526707
danglars pressed his daughters hand in his	51.294899091350324
but extraordinary to relate the father did not say thank you my child nor did th	145.7585832270265
is the conference ended asked eugnie rising	108.91767144222511
danglars motioned that he had nothing more to say	65.19821297784287

while his horses were impatiently pawing the ground held in by the coachman who 	103.89627437884948
andrea cavalcanti as decked up and gay as if he were going to marry a princess	39.07211683352193
he inquired after the count with his usual familiarity and ascending lightly to 	94.11119285752223
the count stopped on seeing the young man	23.66889930009421
as for andrea he was launched and when he was once launched nothing stopped him	60.40563075291701
ah good morning my dear count said he	31.07206977247347
ah m	238.23692170952737
andrea said the latter with his halfjesting tone how do you do	24.188021575647642
charmingly as you see	23.360103457743822
i am come to talk to you about a thousand things but first tell me were you goin	68.1890069432861
i was going out sir	63.05751587385307
then in order not to hinder you i will get up with you if you please in your car	36.95028513921027
no said the count with an imperceptible smile of contempt for he had no wish to 	21.871696323233824
andrea we can chat better indoors and there is no coachman to overhear our conve	115.8810174886342
the count returned to a small drawingroom on the first floor sat down and crossi	23.67365127175001
andrea assumed his gayest manner	276.76254088319723
you know my dear count said he the ceremony is to take place this evening	27.06538062654203
at nine oclock the contract is to be signed at my fatherinlaws	41.04267930652647
ah indeed said monte cristo	7.012637313667143
what is it news to you has not m	69.5711591526742
danglars informed you of the ceremony	131.1457624183243
oh yes said the count i received a letter from him yesterday but i do not think 	22.955926872923275
possibly my fatherinlaw trusted to its general notoriety	312.25352003045833
well said monte cristo you are fortunate m	25.393918253026136
cavalcanti it is a most suitable alliance you are contracting and mademoiselle d	74.26803225436295
yes indeed she is replied cavalcanti in a very modest tone	32.365289734051764
above all she is very richat least i believe so said monte cristo	71.70764114069692
very rich do you think replied the young man	25.201239670196983
doubtless it is said m	36.38628033164862
danglars conceals at least half of his fortune	172.16449302658373
and he acknowledges fifteen or twenty millions said andrea with a look sparkling	67.11567079346766
without reckoning added monte cristo that he is on the eve of entering into a so	55.81654930082427
yes yes i know what you meanthe railway of which he has obtained the grant is it	91.59283589437159
precisely it is generally believed he will gain ten millions by that affair	126.77790683007191
ten millions do you think so it is magnificent said cavalcanti who was quite con	33.094370221523654
without reckoning replied monte cristo that all his fortune will come to you and	41.47849674752695
besides your own fortune as your father assured me is almost equal to that of yo	91.36426526351231
but enough of money matters	288.54366326086233
do you know m	14.878125456262055
andrea i think you have managed this affair rather skilfully	158.74450581542587
not badly by any means said the young man i was born for a diplomatist	31.429703886898682
well you must become a diplomatist diplomacy you know is something that is not t	64.70033803118127
have you lost your heart	96.10736261332686
indeed i fear it replied andrea in the tone in which he had heard dorante or val	19.85535320790857
is your love returned	215.06569644123033
i suppose so said andrea with a triumphant smile since i am accepted	36.010809271326444
but i must not forget one grand point	207.22745473555227
that i have been singularly assisted	87.79212211205092
i have indeed	67.69872770615247
by circumstances	545.5552403620148
no by you	251.10538394389366
by me not at all prince said monte cristo laying a marked stress on the title wh	69.01678443039884
no said andreano it is useless for you to say so count	22.275379449469757
i maintain that the position of a man like you has done more than my name my soc	49.5172149052983
you are completely mistaken sir said monte cristo coldly who felt the perfidious	67.41283680614914
what encouraged me not to become your surety but to patronize youyour fathers na	111.92523847539456
personally i do not know you	8.33094187936078
this calm tone and perfect ease made andrea feel that he was for the moment rest	221.90488839256463
oh then my father has really a very large fortune count	110.4484433163293
it appears so sir replied monte cristo	33.16352996332155
do you know if the marriage settlement he promised me has come	63.92972684025341
i have been advised of it	43.64011936957784
but the three millions	77.9236561382442
the three millions are probably on the road	66.44343946096258
then i shall really have them	96.24769730984255
oh well said the count i do not think you have yet known the want of money	32.78895761699753
andrea was so surprised that he pondered the matter for a moment	32.688851348389036
then arousing from his reverie	323.9036362429449
now sir i have one request to make to you which you will understand even if it s	51.08349381394021
proceed said monte cristo	8.88231942444818
i have formed an acquaintance thanks to my good fortune with many noted persons 	229.52780778860256
but marrying as i am about to do before all paris i ought to be supported by an 	81.82013583349526

i understand well i am come to ask a favor of you	38.11533350425944
of me	225.1112006688042
yes of you	205.70629401585566
and pray what may it be	34.156826624422
well to take his part	114.84043290455858
ah my dear sir whatafter the varied relations i have had the happiness to sustai	40.17087279525317

a gendarme was crossing the court	129.13778021521324
a gendarme is one of the most striking objects in the world even to a man void o	61.10633756869842

and then the baroness remembered that she had felt no pity for poor mercds who h	52.10952132139346
eugnie she said to herself is lost and so are we	153.78900856417005
the affair as it will be reported will cover us with shame for in a society such	146.49459659467414
how fortunate that eugnie is possessed of that strange character which has so of	146.28588175617455
and her glance was turned towards heaven where a mysterious providence disposes 	287.36981474977597
and then her thoughts cleaving through space like a bird in the air rested on ca	237.9173516263413
this andrea was a wretch a robber an assassin and yet his manners showed the eff	60.74673251318216
how could she extricate herself from this labyrinth to whom would she apply to h	89.70801305042296
the baroness then thought of m	151.7893704712767
de villefort	1.046729088308675
it was m	29.00516968595494
de villefort who had remorselessly brought misfortune into her family as though 	141.5087543984388
but no on reflection the procureur was not a merciless man and it was not the ma	51.14762126595541
and since villefort the friend of danglars had acted in this way no one could su	46.35485913779843
villeforts conduct therefore upon reflection appeared to the baroness as if shap	217.38998062695435
but the inflexibility of the procureur should stop there she would see him the n	67.82723212087872
she would invoke the past recall old recollections she would supplicate him by t	246.75728670271184
de villefort would stifle the affair he had only to turn his eyes on one side an	64.76725872285388
and after this reasoning she slept easily	519.3030683471596
at nine oclock next morning she arose and without ringing for her maid or giving	116.97570088504725
de villeforts house	19.70496675921817
for the last month this wretched house had presented the gloomy appearance of a 	85.1391775268699
some of the apartments were closed within and without the shutters were only ope	77.42623346994704
madame danglars involuntarily shuddered at the desolate aspect of the mansion de	76.6748216028607
three times did the bell ring with a dull heavy sound seeming to participate in 	118.53185823702879
he saw a lady a fashionable elegantly dressed lady and yet the door remained alm	130.09986466451065
do you intend opening the door said the baroness	48.15252968200273
first madame who are you	61.30926871790429
who am i you know me well enough	78.01734779307469
we no longer know anyone madame	282.24070672307306
you must be mad my friend said the baroness	21.594043173141984
where do you come from	18.292096963924426
oh this is too much	43.92294495605209
madame these are my orders excuse me	141.30498686556365

the baroness danglars you have seen me twenty times	67.70347321900223
possibly madame	255.3080695885044
and now what do you want	10.38735834801885
oh how extraordinary i shall complain to m	80.53719133368857
de villefort of the impertinence of his servants	38.99461416297803
madame this is precaution not impertinence no one enters here without an order f	325.6646490059056
davrigny or without speaking to the procureur	163.96308697832964
well i have business with the procureur	84.66070493663986
is it pressing business	563.7766406851133
you can imagine so since i have not even brought my carriage out yet	144.29763147606212
but enough of thishere is my card take it to your master	152.60254550691945
madame will await my return	508.20772630555257
yes go	1026.1282045568305
the concierge closed the door leaving madame danglars in the street	55.21010888952302
she had not long to wait directly afterwards the door was opened wide enough to 	79.09022238203895
without losing sight of her for an instant the concierge took a whistle from his	69.61811636354481
the valet de chambre appeared on the doorsteps	24.555118942445084
you will excuse this poor fellow madame he said as he preceded the baroness but 	59.59243911855582
de villefort begged me to tell you that he could not act otherwise	20.101173536117916
in the court showing his merchandise was a tradesman who had been admitted with 	78.31220520618504
the baroness ascended the steps she felt herself strongly infected with the sadn	97.90795153033673
preoccupied as madame danglars had been with the object of her visit the treatme	41.85282221853647
but villefort raising his head bowed down by grief looked up at her with so sad 	112.10246066784912
forgive my servants he said for a terror i can not blame them for from being sus	58.38583711008447
madame danglars had often heard of the terror to which the magistrate alluded bu	79.87806387178068
you too then are unhappy she said	160.19971583740895
yes madame replied the magistrate	25.99485951534001
then you pity me	80.6254131943443
sincerely madame	103.43226658050509
and you understand what brings me here	70.07466453521232
you wish to speak to me about the circumstance which has just happened	27.95231122138943
yes sira fearful misfortune	6436.315283764814
you mean a mischance	233.55470854521084
a mischance repeated the baroness	143.43949314833606
alas madame said the procureur with his imperturbable calmness of manner i consi	36.34903090126168
and do you suppose this will be forgotten	35.62071942846835
everything will be forgotten madame said villefort	29.02307910923
your daughter will be married tomorrow if not todayin a week if not tomorrow and	123.41171086207306
madame danglars gazed on villefort stupefied to find him so almost insultingly c	87.77868526315837
am i come to a friend she asked in a tone full of mournful dignity	39.58642859202268
you know that you are madame said villefort whose pale cheeks became slightly fl	69.2445659805636
and truly this assurance carried him back to different events from those now occ	477.2039437135386
well then be more affectionate my dear villefort said the baroness	31.803659924280634
speak to me not as a magistrate but as a friend and when i am in bitter anguish 	41.02948100910795
villefort bowed	57.602116008380484
when i hear misfortunes named madame he said i have within the last few months c	182.07230297109857
that is the reason that by the side of my misfortunes yours appear to me mere mi	63.926648023396375
but this annoys you let us change the subject	178.62479267649653
you were saying madame	66.3915318007605
i came to ask you my friend said the baroness what will be done with this impost	22.116569227735148
impostor repeated villefort certainly madame you appear to extenuate some cases 	195.5505325941628
impostor indeedm	9.66296957236891
andrea cavalcanti or rather m	75.0036181269168
benedetto is nothing more nor less than an assassin	164.221531184976
sir i do not deny the justice of your correction but the more severely you arm y	47.99922312577452
come forget him for a moment and instead of pursuing him let him go	87.68991145695077
you are too late madame the orders are issued	114.59668056972583
well should he be arresteddo they think they will arrest him	185.7916833918202
i hope so	99.14924911733432
if they should arrest him i know that sometimes prisons afford means of escape w	221.66926333603638
the procureur shook his head	25.450474577249217
at least keep him there till my daughter be married	319.0600816763949
impossible madame justice has its formalities	442.1895785492554
what even for me said the baroness half jesting half in earnest	135.13629414905395
for all even for myself among the rest replied villefort	163.11161778735774
50063 m	1.1533656045944949
ah exclaimed the baroness without expressing the ideas which the exclamation bet	174.96385180621584
villefort looked at her with that piercing glance which reads the secrets of the	42.708699612552095
yes i know what you mean he said you refer to the terrible rumors spread abroad 	89.61224570942107
i was not thinking of that replied madame danglars quickly	34.7912444512338
yes you were thinking of it and with justice	57.366603785435665
you could not help thinking of it and saying to yourself you who pursue crime so	164.71042285604543
you were saying this were you not	57.22041628644991
well i own it	97.67139891969587
i will answer you	16.6047184539261
villefort drew his armchair nearer to madame danglars then resting both hands up	106.7109286466896
there are crimes which remain unpunished because the criminals are unknown and w	100.00758839380681
now after the oath i have just taken and which i will keep madame dare you ask f	110.1107400957217
but sir are you sure he is as guilty as they say	46.25277516301685
listen this is his description benedetto condemned at the age of sixteen for fiv	80.45014012515371
he promised well as you seefirst a runaway then an assassin	174.87402155515883
and who is this wretch	45.59532299056338
who can tella vagabond a corsican	146.05831036543157
has no one owned him	93.76337725563586
no one his parents are unknown	269.0067779381017
but who was the man who brought him from lucca	35.949911320971204
another rascal like himself perhaps his accomplice	815.7043486135267
the baroness clasped her hands	67.72429929946418
villefort she exclaimed in her softest and most captivating manner	61.536020796745404
for heavens sake madame said villefort with a firmness of expression not altoget	18.131620344020778

alas alas alas all the world is wicked let us therefore strike at wickedness	164.86404024493797
villefort pronounced these last words with a feverish rage which gave a ferociou	79.69092448134889
but said madame danglars resolving to make a last effort this young man though a	66.49922441949128
so much the worse or rather so much the better it has been so ordained that he m	26.511961191033258
but this is trampling on the weak sir	141.44365442721622
the weakness of a murderer	174.14782020742913
his dishonor reflects upon us	358.3836980236195
is not death in my house	71.03343573148197
oh sir exclaimed the baroness you are without pity for others well then i tell y	66.60721876772541

do you not think that i also long for forgetfulness while working night and day 	158.24426859939982
but sir he has fled let him escapeinaction is a pardonable offence	118.58324641174173

sir said the valet de chambre entering the room a dragoon has brought this despa	39.620647192389384
villefort seized the letter and hastily broke the seal	97.46195058164388
madame danglars trembled with fear villefort started with joy	97.53991777615578
arrested he exclaimed he was taken at compigne and all is over	58.96428687501253
madame danglars rose from her seat pale and cold	58.307240543283065
adieu sir she said	24.9111283842794
adieu madame replied the kings attorney as in an almost joyful manner he conduct	76.3961099471544
then turning to his desk he said striking the letter with the back of his right 	43.99748532679699

chapter 100	1037.3366092143324
the apparition	2493.7674857060406
as the procureur had told madame danglars valentine was not yet recovered	46.34835004950612
bowed down with fatigue she was indeed confined to her bed and it was in her own	57.63813627916412
but valentine was so weak that this recital scarcely produced the same effect it	102.34215369295609
indeed her brain was only the seat of vague ideas and confused forms mingled wit	342.56373546527925
during the daytime valentines perceptions remained tolerably clear owing to the 	118.969680535463
noirtier who caused himself to be carried to his granddaughters room and watched	68.7515490258623
at six oclock villefort retired to his study at eight m	49.845651222495285
davrigny himself arrived bringing the night draught prepared for the young girl 	287.31514553684747
noirtier was carried away	141.66464374510085
a nurse of the doctors choice succeeded them and never left till about ten or el	170.24920885094735
as she went downstairs she gave the keys of valentines room to m	53.72100005266375
de villefort so that no one could reach the sickroom excepting through that of m	104.47917508689603
every morning morrel called on noirtier to receive news of valentine and extraor	44.975934067642925
certainly though valentine still labored under dreadful nervous excitement she w	332.0244739823736
now four days had elapsed and valentine still lived	120.75844739063999
the nervous excitement of which we speak pursued valentine even in her sleep or 	218.6274535426731
first she fancied she saw her stepmother threatening her then morrel stretched h	79.23891410425816
on the evening of the day on which valentine had learned of the flight of eugnie	16.284909106195315
eleven oclock had struck	43.25453152775398
the nurse having placed the beverage prepared by the doctor within reach of the 	203.85414181419347
meanwhile an unexpected scene was passing in the room which had been so carefull	53.94216296975459
ten minutes had elapsed since the nurse had left valentine who for the last hour	43.385763162664865
the nightlamp threw out countless rays each resolving itself into some strange f	661.3663979602001
at any other time valentine would have seized the silken bellpull and summoned a	57.78101001971794
her reason told her that all the visions she beheld were but the children of her	142.08048868153685
from behind the door a human figure appeared but the girl was too familiar with 	113.30885507870515
the figure advanced towards the bed and appeared to listen with profound attenti	93.11820832921593
at this moment a ray of light glanced across the face of the midnight visitor	29.294776384650262
it is not he she murmured and waited in the assurance that this was but a dream 	57.54295539268961
still she felt her pulse and finding it throb violently she remembered that the 	110.0587725193512
valentine therefore reached her hand towards the glass but as soon as her trembl	71.25805253590899
this time the illusion or rather the reality surpassed anything valentine had be	132.76470351325608
the pressure she felt was evidently intended to arrest her arm and she slowly wi	172.22870283971287
then the figure from whom she could not detach her eyes and who appeared more pr	95.55471912525941
this did not seem sufficient the man or rather the ghostfor he trod so softly th	162.0425049270018
valentine witnessed this scene with a sentiment of stupefaction	54.71736145686167
every minute she had expected that it would vanish and give place to another vis	103.63581439746956
valentine shuddered	361.23329025296255
it was the first time one of these visions had ever addressed her in a living vo	39.140207327086664
the man placed his finger on her lips	49.400581076819684
the count of monte cristo she murmured	19.83694693162588
it was easy to see that no doubt now remained in the young girls mind as to the 	57.193656136732464
still the presence of monte cristo at such an hour his mysterious fanciful and e	57.12772305567661

listen to me he said or rather look upon me look at my face paler even than usua	56.5573649615587
the blood mounted rapidly to the cheeks of valentine for the name just announced	79.52924843607681
maximilian she exclaimed and so sweet did the sound appear to her that she repea	60.260893272937096
he told me your life was his and i have promised him that you shall live	72.21744827685264
you have promised him that i shall live	30.663062314337644

are you a doctor	29.4478122193247

hush my child said monte cristo again placing his finger upon her lips i did say	39.33279236638199
but drink some of this and the count took a bottle from his pocket containing a 	59.18815150289646
drink this and then take nothing more tonight	201.1798368518994
valentine stretched out her hand but scarcely had she touched the glass when she	61.77141657436423
monte cristo took the glass drank half its contents and then presented it to val	47.898736518609155
oh yes she exclaimed i recognize the flavor of my nocturnal beverage which refre	59.69180698971988

but oh how i passed that time oh the wretched hours i have enduredthe torture to	291.65106073598713
sir said valentine at the height of her terror you say you endured tortures when	81.52785245495288
valentine raised herself in bed and drew over her chest which appeared whiter th	65.16545347792295

and have they all tasted of a slightly bitter flavor like that of dried orangepe	290.80438192287113
oh yes yes	11.275714919731445
then that explains all said monte cristo	48.66752215398228

oh heavens exclaimed valentine wiping off the drops which ran down her forehead	58.445167577926874
midnight struck slowly and sadly every hour seemed to strike with leaden weight 	298.05357564640593

valentine had raised herself upon her elbow and had scarcely time to throw herse	51.67767762500242
someone approached the bed and drew back the curtains	69.64404766200266
valentine summoned every effort and breathed with that regular respiration which	217.96761247813993
valentine said a low voice	30.55965985436945
the girl shuddered to the heart but did not reply	65.43485509188491
valentine repeated the same voice	88.60937555328415
still silent valentine had promised not to wake	157.89257880260223
then everything was still excepting that valentine heard the almost noiseless so	287.4713708873677

but why is my grandfather allowed to live	140.60624324882974
it was considered that you dead the fortune would naturally revert to your broth	178.0853442546184

yes said he	9.985610200835506
valentine carried the pastille to her mouth and swallowed it	61.83244781634142

the nightlight continued to burn on the chimneypiece exhausting the last drops o	95.33307969176059
the globe of the lamp appeared of a reddish hue and the flame brightening before	107.32072501355083
a dull and dismal light was shed over the bedclothes and curtains surrounding th	82.92505754287511
all noise in the streets had ceased and the silence was frightful	120.68591571712172
it was then that the door of edwards room opened and a head we have before notic	42.7062253251907
she stopped in the doorway listened for a moment to the flickering of the lamp t	40.636177721530785
it was still about a quarter full as we before stated	117.58240827945059
madame de villefort emptied the contents into the ashes which she disturbed that	50.414870370279715
if anyone could have looked into the room just then he would have noticed the he	101.1616972547862

the young girl no longer breathed no breath issued through the halfclosed teeth 	99.31301353095989
madame de villefort gazed upon the face so expressive even in its stillness then	115.16298444444709
it was cold and motionless	47.30839596044289
she only felt the pulsation in her own fingers and withdrew her hand with a shud	45.84475867747839
one arm was hanging out of the bed from shoulder to elbow it was moulded after t	124.18407566033515
the nails too were turning blue	3623.8783627387493
madame de villefort had no longer any doubt all was overshe had consummated the 	49.06829158773321
there was no more to do in the room so the poisoner retired stealthily as though	65.46531510713615
the minutes passed madame de villefort could not drop the curtain which she held	117.66328564963656
she was lost in reverie and the reverie of crime is remorse	137.09548610170768

immediately afterwards the light expired and the room was plunged in frightful o	112.689588185393
overpowered with agitation the poisoner succeeded in groping her way to the door	105.95756996426807
the darkness lasted two hours longer then by degrees a cold light crept through 	244.4561226303987
about this time the nurses cough was heard on the stairs and the woman entered t	35.82810814143435

then she went to the fireplace and lit the fire and although she had just left h	56.565051550002494
the clock striking eight awoke her	1064.462075730649
astonished at the prolonged slumber of the patient and frightened to see that th	64.03727354410523
she tried to replace the arm but it moved with a frightful rigidity which could 	111.05486481855775
she screamed aloud then running to the door exclaimed	133.58400994940138

whatthis one too he exclaimed	373.3183231496579
oh where will be the end	59.907663305113964
villefort rushed into the room	29.03101702310663
what are you saying doctor he exclaimed raising his hands to heaven	32.22361736306415
i say that valentine is dead replied davrigny in a voice terrible in its solemn 	47.250884465181194
50085 m	1.4480841020127673
de villefort staggered and buried his head in the bed	39.17059397114402
on the exclamation of the doctor and the cry of the father the servants all fled	72.68698727326387
just then madame de villefort in the act of slipping on her dressinggown threw a	34.86507244291017
on a sudden she stepped or rather bounded with outstretched arms towards the tab	82.85288573432243
she saw davrigny curiously examining the glass which she felt certain of having 	118.05392706369933

ah he exclaimed it is no longer brucine that is used let me see what it is	33.703573631250194

dead repeated a third voice	109.03921749858765
who said valentine was dead	62.31161150980748
the two men turned round and saw morrel standing at the door pale and terrorstri	23.399328803312056
this is what had happened	54.764372019251084
at the usual time morrel had presented himself at the little door leading to noi	28.34900282979089
contrary to custom the door was open and having no occasion to ring he entered	89.45876133807114
he waited for a moment in the hall and called for a servant to conduct him to m	29.897587627632024
noirtier but no one answered the servants having as we know deserted the house	106.72904479429418
morrel had no particular reason for uneasiness monte cristo had promised him tha	73.28122015984252
every night the count had given him news which was the next morning confirmed by	65.97841986568001
still this extraordinary silence appeared strange to him and he called a second 	93.21412208888664
then he determined to go up	55.448876098576264
noirtiers room was opened like all the rest	107.05510034870701
the first thing he saw was the old man sitting in his armchair in his usual plac	37.94353372944888
how are you sir asked morrel with a sickness of heart	19.459430551410474
well answered the old man by closing his eyes but his appearance manifested incr	57.391884938605685
you are thoughtful sir continued morrel you want something shall i call one of t	68.03622754666361
yes replied noirtier	5.493940217384457
morrel pulled the bell but though he nearly broke the cord no one answered	188.72539574631674
he turned towards noirtier the pallor and anguish expressed on his countenance m	91.92523556407673

maximilian tried to speak but he could articulate nothing he staggered and suppo	59.301773770948465
then he pointed to the door	20.812210661497872
yes yes yes continued the old man	13.80992023852124

maximilian rushed up the little staircase while noirtiers eyes seemed to sayquic	68.52712108684186
in a minute the young man darted through several rooms till at length he reached	86.41776167938885
there was no occasion to push the door it was wide open	39.16839936824567
a sob was the only sound he heard	109.58082731947792
he saw as though in a mist a black figure kneeling and buried in a confused mass	55.96245902099925
a terrible fear transfixed him	553.0420171603447
it was then he heard a voice exclaim valentine is dead and another voice which l	42.31570084263998

villefort rose halfashamed of being surprised in such a paroxysm of grief	65.48948097852262
the terrible office he had held for twentyfive years had succeeded in making him	208.52984418614972
his glance at first wandering fixed itself upon morrel	238.53860754006075

but morrel remained motionless he could not detach his eyes from that disordered	73.94300980022544

maximilian stared for a moment at the corpse gazed all around the room then upon	115.06922953308703
but in less than five minutes the staircase groaned beneath an extraordinary wei	127.40695839969403
morrel was seen carrying with superhuman strength the armchair containing noirti	349.1693209530964
when he reached the landing he placed the armchair on the floor and rapidly roll	59.2186967869311
this could only have been accomplished by means of unnatural strength supplied b	129.840439083956
but the most fearful spectacle was noirtier being pushed towards the bed his fac	127.0280636003011

davrigny rushed towards the old man and made him inhale a powerful restorative	70.89848501513741
sir cried morrel seizing the moist hand of the paralytic they ask me who i am an	43.54159500172125
oh you know it tell them tell them and the young mans voice was choked by sobs	79.67747376036071
as for the old man his chest heaved with his panting respiration	42.889403557373505
one could have thought that he was undergoing the agonies preceding death	116.62716019275584
at length happier than the young man who sobbed without weeping tears glistened 	80.5130777815358

the young man overwhelmed by the weight of his anguish fell heavily on his knees	30.43001911685285
davrigny unable to bear the sight of this touching emotion turned away and ville	77.8590670812384
but morrel saw nothing he had grasped the hand of valentine and unable to weep v	40.344570949343165
for some time nothing was heard in that chamber but sobs exclamations and prayer	160.79321056445764
at length villefort the most composed of all spoke	140.24345532965438
sir said he to maximilian you say you loved valentine that you were betrothed to	35.10687761315821

i tell you sir that two persons exist in you the father has mourned sufficiently	97.80893362537178
the eyes of noirtier glistened and davrigny approached	41.67080239303579

the young mans implacable eyes interrogated villefort who on his side glanced fr	74.77603686273989
but instead of finding sympathy in the eyes of the doctor and his father he only	53.870383124878096
yes indicated the old man	35.724327172055844

i am stricken by fate	197.30936405973407
it is horrible indeed but no one assassinates	85.19668303180892
the eyes of noirtier lighted up with rage and davrigny prepared to speak	47.9177773566752
morrel however extended his arm and commanded silence	421.8710374553603
and i say that murders are committed here said morrel whose voice though lower i	132.56669994969084

noirtier wishes to speak	59.844879153860404

davrigny listen	2400.8357789911715
noirtier looked upon morrel with one of those melancholy smiles which had so oft	24.72424680842231
then having riveted the eyes of his interlocutor on his own he glanced towards t	91.28100526779761
do you wish me to leave said morrel sadly	24.774544492117474
yes replied noirtier	5.530196986650443
alas alas sir have pity on me	109.15881713451871
the old mans eyes remained fixed on the door	24.545800511683684

the doctor	331.7676174191455
you wish to remain alone with m	115.52439017432809
de villefort	1.0462094547465093
but can he understand you	154.9124364451363
oh said villefort inexpressibly delighted to think that the inquiries were to be	45.199743996805985
while uttering these words with this expression of joy his teeth clashed togethe	91.71428880407831
davrigny took the young mans arm and led him out of the room	19.84743026543085
a more than deathlike silence then reigned in the house	91.74827547047413
at the end of a quarter of an hour a faltering footstep was heard and villefort 	9.21634023951023
you can come he said and led them back to noirtier	52.22130686732914
morrel looked attentively on villefort	59.87130956733418
his face was livid large drops rolled down his face and in his fingers he held t	46.90077235535518
gentlemen he said in a hoarse voice give me your word of honor that this horribl	23.118096328360295

my father has revealed the culprits name my father thirsts for revenge as much a	69.08678607208795
do you not father	52.58791113979057
yes resolutely replied noirtier	93.29567529690529
morrel suffered an exclamation of horror and surprise to escape him	62.25280853954668
oh sir said villefort arresting maximilian by the arm if my father the inflexibl	64.08770725906264
is it not so father	38.73920922208592
the old man made a sign in the affirmative	12.256685797994068
villefort continued	154.48429926007694
he knows me and i have pledged my word to him	40.8312557617328
rest assured gentlemen that within three days in a less time than justice would 	207.5272747106026

noirtier asked morrel while davrigny looked inquiringly	83.40032215179728
yes replied noirtier with an expression of sinister joy	13.996196311467175
swear then said villefort joining the hands of morrel and davrigny swear that yo	39.272746147412114
davrigny turned round and uttered a very feeble yes but morrel disengaging his h	76.6725548293178
we have before stated that all the servants had fled	80.86073295816198
de villefort was therefore obliged to request m	45.53195784780534
davrigny to superintend all the arrangements consequent upon a death in a large 	143.8866862427202
it was something terrible to witness the silent agony the mute despair of noirti	167.22950036050375
villefort retired to his study and davrigny left to summon the doctor of the may	81.93722516272238
noirtier could not be persuaded to quit his grandchild	52.94128371409926
at the end of a quarter of an hour m	6.028865539466717
davrigny returned with his associate they found the outer gate closed and not a 	82.46209503789099
but he stopped on the landing he had not the courage to again visit the death ch	71.11687604181498
the two doctors therefore entered the room alone	99.22582182734975
noirtier was near the bed pale motionless and silent as the corpse	78.25673439755589
the district doctor approached with the indifference of a man accustomed to spen	86.60260855363596
alas said davrigny she is indeed dead poor child	62.40119958811633

yes answered the doctor laconically dropping the sheet he had raised	106.81468010495034
noirtier uttered a kind of hoarse rattling sound the old mans eyes sparkled and 	45.34218489400918
he therefore approached the bed and while his companion was dipping the fingers 	110.86624030558741
a tear which appeared in the old mans eye expressed his thanks to the doctor	73.05189801286525
the doctor of the dead then laid his permit on the corner of the table and havin	54.432367679065614
villefort met them at the door of his study having in a few words thanked the di	44.65081100912297
and now the priest	93.52506408806649

for some temperaments work is a remedy for all afflictions	140.32111671514878
as the doctors entered the street they saw a man in a cassock standing on the th	30.590560781342152
this is the abb of whom i spoke said the doctor to davrigny	27.90389005378645
davrigny accosted the priest	345.1744462604553

i am going sir and i do not hesitate to say that no prayers will be more fervent	43.10273797304265
davrigny took the priests hand and without meeting villefort who was engaged in 	63.66266656375952
on entering the room noirtiers eyes met those of the abb and no doubt he read so	60.39281448878097
davrigny recommended the attention of the priest to the living as well as to the	44.561520094369385

the next morning dawned dull and cloudy	124.07001964341522
during the night the undertakers had executed their melancholy office and wrappe	53.71208636543752
this windingsheet was nothing more than a beautiful piece of cambric which the y	56.127187205206035
during the evening two men engaged for the purpose had carried noirtier from val	76.98765588537427
the abb busoni had watched till daylight and then left without calling anyone	154.00277402287753
davrigny returned about eight oclock in the morning he met villefort on his way 	30.127774376710196
they found him in the large armchair which served him for a bed enjoying a calm 	102.90308592965484
they both stood in amazement at the door	42.17818172622608
see said davrigny to villefort nature knows how to alleviate the deepest sorrow	121.69210454973754
no one can say that m	39.304200874347146
noirtier did not love his child and yet he sleeps	51.7514832971941
yes you are right replied villefort surprised he sleeps indeed and this is the m	46.43878548049458
grief has stunned him replied davrigny and they both returned thoughtfully to th	99.72358515602701

no i have a cousin who has undertaken this sad office	89.87795220680113
i shall work doctorwhen i work i forget everything	363.78188465832125
and indeed no sooner had the doctor left the room than he was again absorbed in 	115.70179403317556
on the doorsteps davrigny met the cousin whom villefort had mentioned a personag	48.268552976763225
he was punctual dressed in black with crape around his hat and presented himself	81.70640853737545
at eleven oclock the mourningcoaches rolled into the paved court and the rue du 	34.91794662469512
gradually the receptionroom filled and some of our old friends made their appear	202.24738662941172
de villefort moved in the first parisian circles less owing to his social positi	59.724349376573066
the cousin standing at the door ushered in the guests and it was rather a relief	75.30812565419343
those who were acquainted soon formed into little groups	690.4496314904726
one of them was made of debray chteaurenaud and beauchamp	14.27172253165962
poor girl said debray like the rest paying an involuntary tribute to the sad eve	110.87755402341645

the gentleman who receives us is he a deputy	234.87086991902478
oh no	19.893350544093018

have you mentioned this death in your paper	97.25633673629767
it has been mentioned but the article is not mine indeed i doubt if it will plea	105.7349909976922
villefort for it says that if four successive deaths had happened anywhere else 	124.80549399422041
still said chteaurenaud dr	6.951836378141569
davrigny who attends my mother declares he is in despair about it	124.26789398244703
but whom are you seeking debray	123.20309719689998
i am seeking the count of monte cristo said the young man	11.983126400671855
i met him on the boulevard on my way here said beauchamp	43.48773991397824
i think he is about to leave paris he was going to his banker	39.676173621724494
his banker danglars is his banker is he not asked chteaurenaud of debray	35.00432616994957
i believe so replied the secretary with slight uneasiness	48.253974390990116
but monte cristo is not the only one i miss here i do not see morrel	38.99596225715287
morrel do they know him asked chteaurenaud	45.66473129216235
i think he has only been introduced to madame de villefort	24.84292026190823
still he ought to have been here said debray i wonder what will be talked about 	59.69937870015168
but hush here comes our minister of justice he will feel obliged to make some li	198.96965632235094
beauchamp told the truth when he said that on his way to the funeral he had met 	50.380325166138455
the banker saw the carriage of the count enter the courtyard and advanced to mee	38.57769262516829

besides what asked the count	19.688192539167687
alas do you not know	13.075443530422437
what new calamity	859.5214575301407

good heavens what are you telling me	32.04038526429371

oh how happy you must be in not having either wife or children	232.39447713671

she could not endure the insult offered to us by that wretch so she asked permis	131.7477903496233
and is she gone	315.8069927856229
the other night she left	304.8882849796187
with madame danglars	39.711482856199154
no with a relation	134.5323172557027
but still we have quite lost our dear eugnie for i doubt whether her pride will 	113.99477898012746
still baron said monte cristo family griefs or indeed any other affliction which	124.62548142681557
philosophers may well say and practical men will always support the opinion that	308.84840308387373
danglars looked at him askance as though to ascertain whether he spoke seriously	45.467748485251214

certainly i excuse you said monte cristo graciously and pocket them	219.0273035684762
and he placed the bonds in his pocketbook	31.723068355373016
but said danglars there is still a sum of one hundred thousand francs	21.638550742115427
oh a mere nothing said monte cristo	52.0646531776929
the balance would come to about that sum but keep it and we shall be quits	138.01553574924475

ma foi said monte cristo i think i arrived just in time to obtain your signature	32.46167298181401

at the door he found his carriage and was immediately driven to the bank	40.27262812020755
meanwhile danglars repressing all emotion advanced to meet the receivergeneral	243.18259016455698
we need not say that a smile of condescension was stamped upon his lips	59.15711422250063
goodmorning creditor said he for i wager anything it is the creditor who visits 	165.8922722628647

here is his receipt	72.07808283868005
believe your own eyes	104.33375347088786

de boville manifested signs of extraordinary admiration	305.6524969755257
i must visit him he said and obtain some pious grant from him	167.06085299310132
oh you may make sure of him his charities alone amount to 20000 francs a month	128.45931995446782
it is magnificent i will set before him the example of madame de morcerf and her	33.326469055686395
what example	9160.760504767493
they gave all their fortune to the hospitals	100.78325890188316
what fortune	10699.162249669584
their ownm	132.27359097891923
de morcerfs who is deceased	20.685905245440154
for what reason	59.259231717343866
because they would not spend money so guiltily acquired	301.4260474464962
and what are they to live upon	50.43974555769145
the mother retires into the country and the son enters the army	181.8743768563379
50113 m	1.3485623453505236
well i must confess these are scruples	201.0370477464823
i registered their deed of gift yesterday	1524.4094870198592
and how much did they possess	109.83658637979866
oh not muchfrom twelve to thirteen hundred thousand francs	111.34835835781918
but to return to our millions	93.57274960597559
certainly said danglars in the most natural tone in the world	11.907370674304056
are you then pressed for this money	91.80639252420971
yes for the examination of our cash takes place tomorrow	151.50186494216018
tomorrow why did you not tell me so before why it is as good as a century at wha	32.42694137310963
at two oclock	18.066082639531352
send at twelve said danglars smiling	75.87572421126804
de boville said nothing but nodded his head and took up the portfolio	53.628502940435936
now i think of it you can do better said danglars	19.372560366758115
how do you mean	4.391818950010616
the receipt of m	112.93655388090318

what though payable at rome	874.8134453082849
certainly it will only cost you a discount of 5000 or 6000 francs	53.07562771554503
the receiver started back	1102.7010617132555
ma foi he said i prefer waiting till tomorrow	82.37229550377859
what a proposition	625.7622870247527
i thought perhaps said danglars with supreme impertinence that you had a deficie	45.37655342530613
indeed said the receiver	67.7080253500092
and if that were the case it would be worth while to make some sacrifice	49.20154596283425
thank you no sir	32.20614393918155
then it will be tomorrow	33.740959696715755
yes but without fail	285.7800376895972
ah you are laughing at me send tomorrow at twelve and the bank shall be notified	94.37840247873127
i will come myself	66.92986160409946
better still since it will afford me the pleasure of seeing you	66.61716063905304
they shook hands	4344.517062834673
by the way said m	29.489482665448143
de boville are you not going to the funeral of poor mademoiselle de villefort wh	21.19939159000054
no said the banker i have appeared rather ridiculous since that affair of benede	63.708795132851904
bah you are wrong	28.26987179233303
how were you to blame in that affair	57.166799464756224

everybody pities you sir and above all mademoiselle danglars	331.160056959331
poor eugnie said danglars do you know she is going to embrace a religious life	27.9940745512093
alas it is unhappily but too true	86.72608697929105
the day after the event she decided on leaving paris with a nun of her acquainta	53.31116288978513
oh it is terrible and m	62.19121410816547
de boville retired with this exclamation after expressing acute sympathy with th	176.51311099289495
but he had scarcely left before danglars with an energy of action those can alon	97.70712721403842
then enclosing monte cristos receipt in a little pocketbook he addedyes come at 	150.13046010287795

the cemetery of prelachaise	25.674215828670096
de boville had indeed met the funeral procession which was taking valentine to h	46.09261370172886
the weather was dull and stormy a cold wind shook the few remaining yellow leave	379.84908777545786
de villefort a true parisian considered the cemetery of prelachaise alone worthy	91.25493681196741
he had therefore purchased a vault which was quickly occupied by members of his 	69.2704572313965
on the front of the monument was inscribed the families of saintmran and villefo	29.841762319318665

chteaurenaud perceived him and immediately alighting from his coup joined him be	202.73180063791474
the count looked attentively through every opening in the crowd he was evidently	70.91897503688918
50119 m	2.998621005847506
where is morrel he asked do either of these gentlemen know where he is	59.12891263658368
we have already asked that question said chteaurenaud for none of us has seen hi	107.10605822687342
the count was silent but continued to gaze around him	53.175601478120996
at length they arrived at the cemetery	22.112936428428213
the piercing eye of monte cristo glanced through clusters of bushes and trees an	91.21543488389744
one funeral is generally very much like another in this magnificent metropolis	234.19628573717338
black figures are seen scattered over the long white avenues the silence of eart	135.30154972126977
the shadow monte cristo had noticed passed rapidly behind the tomb of ablard and	77.36670488135357
each persons attention was occupied	600.4159021271965
monte cristo saw nothing but the shadow which no one else observed	74.46771508376031
twice the count left the ranks to see whether the object of his interest had any	69.95257527172252
when the procession stopped this shadow was recognized as morrel who with his co	93.0390284485053
everything was conducted in the usual manner	70.14854884901044
a few men the least impressed of all by the scene pronounced a discourse some de	373.46218459670484
monte cristo heard and saw nothing or rather he only saw morrel whose calmness h	112.14181017175821
see said beauchamp pointing out morrel to debray	49.07885673448851
what is he doing up there and they called chteaurenauds attention to him	63.66527729564028
how pale he is said chteaurenaud shuddering	78.72693874800397
he is cold said debray	34.93922370244945
not at all said chteaurenaud slowly i think he is violently agitated	55.48884146207461
he is very susceptible	32.36255049730731
bah said debray he scarcely knew mademoiselle de villefort you said so yourself	95.35994936535289
still i remember he danced three times with her at madame de morcerfs	61.955252565904836
do you recollect that ball count where you produced such an effect	213.3208265210386

no i do not replied monte cristo without even knowing of what or to whom he was 	39.00912954413798
the discourse is over farewell gentlemen said the count unceremoniously	105.07561691647138
and he disappeared without anyone seeing whither he went	280.88214304685
the funeral being over the guests returned to paris	113.61751514333928

the young man knelt down	24.855723192517125
the count with outstretched neck and glaring eyes stood in an attitude ready to 	108.7770676695253
morrel bent his head till it touched the stone then clutching the grating with b	85.59541263328448

i was looking for you my friend	30.208353328165995
monte cristo expected a burst of passion but he was deceived for morrel turning 	86.0572522254242
you see i was praying	64.42729362184487
the scrutinizing glance of the count searched the young man from head to foot	98.76543430162204
he then seemed more easy	548.4316316353719
shall i drive you back to paris he asked	42.04776557670575
no thank you	19.499910389476977
do you wish anything	18.871427611608343
leave me to pray	53.25507612285089
the count withdrew without opposition but it was only to place himself in a situ	52.6437094563342
he walked slowly down the rue de la roquette	24.895139048076356
the count dismissing his carriage followed him about a hundred paces behind	55.05852032666943
maximilian crossed the canal and entered the rue meslay by the boulevards	78.95780931578454

morrel evidently discomposed came to meet monte cristo less with the intention o	196.75682858300198
