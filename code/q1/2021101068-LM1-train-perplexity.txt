Difficult for Kings to return to the Capitals of their Kingdoms	193.79386048458022
In a splendid chamber of the Palais Royal formerly styled the Palais Cardinal a man was sitting in deep reverie his head supported on his hands leaning over a gilt and inlaid table which was covered with letters and papers	105.884700800733
Behind this figure glowed a vast fireplace alive with leaping flames great logs of oak blazed and crackled on the polished brass andirons whose flicker shone upon the superb habiliments of the lonely tenant of the room which was illumined grandly by twin candelabra rich with waxlights	970.8618094889557
Any one who happened at that moment to contemplate that red simarthe gorgeous robe of officeand the rich lace or who gazed on that pale brow bent in anxious meditation might in the solitude of that apartment combined with the silence of the antechambers and the measured paces of the guards upon the landingplace have fancied that the shade of Cardinal Richelieu lingered still in his accustomed haunt	380.0026420019827
It was alas the ghost of former greatness	1579.948343803787
France enfeebled the authority of her sovereign contemned her nobles returning to their former turbulence and insolence her enemies within her frontiersall proved the great Richelieu no longer in existence	780.6330813158547
In truth that the red simar which occupied the wonted place was his no longer was still more strikingly obvious from the isolation which seemed as we have observed more appropriate to a phantom than a living creaturefrom the corridors deserted by courtiers and courts crowded with guardsfrom that spirit of bitter ridicule which arising from the streets below penetrated through the very casements of the room which resounded with the murmurs of a whole city leagued against the minister as well as from the distant and incessant sounds of guns firinglet off happily without other end or aim except to show to the guards the Swiss troops and the military who surrounded the Palais Royal that the people were possessed of arms	307.6890715039028
The shade of Richelieu was Mazarin	25099.035969606208
Now Mazarin was alone and defenceless as he well knew	552.7370140588109
Foreigner he ejaculated Italian that is their mean yet mighty byword of reproachthe watchword with which they assassinated hanged and made away with Concini and if I gave them their way they would assassinate hang and make away with me in the same manner although they have nothing to complain of except a tax or two now and then	364.613277933145
Idiots ignorant of their real enemies they do not perceive that it is not the Italian who speaks French badly but those who can say fine things to them in the purest Parisian accent who are their real foes	146.47376551284063
Yes yes Mazarin continued whilst his wonted smile full of subtlety lent a strange expression to his pale lips yes these noises prove to me indeed that the destiny of favorites is precarious but ye shall know I am no ordinary favorite	355.7292084776057
No The Earl of Essex tis true wore a splendid ring set with diamonds given him by his royal mistress whilst II have nothing but a simple circlet of gold with a cipher on it and a date but that ring has been blessed in the chapel of the Palais Royal so they will never ruin me as they long to do and whilst they shout Down with Mazarin I unknown and unperceived by them incite them to cry out Long live the Duke de Beaufort one day another Long live the Prince de Conde and again Long live the parliament And at this word the smile on the cardinals lips assumed an expression of hatred of which his mild countenance seemed incapable	247.53712240658925
The parliament We shall soon see how to dispose he continued of the parliament Both Orleans and Montargis are ours	488.45615849290596
It will be a work of time but those who have begun by crying out Down with Mazarin will finish by shouting out Down with all the people I have mentioned each in his turn	139.09901567494472
It is said that Mazarin who though a cardinal had not taken such vows as to prevent it was secretly married to Anne of Austria	184.74793826451523
Richelieu whom they hated during his lifetime and whom they now praise after his death was even less popular than I am	177.38756022121197
Often he was driven away oftener still had he a dread of being sent away	537.2472008614185
The queen will never banish me and even were I obliged to yield to the populace she would yield with me if I fly she will fly and then we shall see how the rebels will get on without either king or queen	147.52457644191415
Oh were I not a foreigner were I but a Frenchman were I but of gentle birth	649.5521291321039
The position of the cardinal was indeed critical and recent events had added to his difficulties	495.5735752732689
Discontent had long pervaded the lower ranks of society in France	116.16605753430379
Crushed and impoverished by taxationimposed by Mazarin whose avarice impelled him to grind them down to the very dustthe people as the AdvocateGeneral Talon described it had nothing left to them except their souls and as those could not be sold by auction they began to murmur	496.88397947657563
Patience had in vain been recommended to them by reports of brilliant victories gained by France laurels however were not meat and drink and the people had for some time been in a state of discontent	346.38912246494493
Had this been all it might not perhaps have greatly signified for when the lower classes alone complained the court of France separated as it was from the poor by the intervening classes of the gentry and the bourgeoisie seldom listened to their voice but unluckily Mazarin had had the imprudence to attack the magistrates and had sold no less than twelve appointments in the Court of Requests at a high price and as the officers of that court paid very dearly for their places and as the addition of twelve new colleagues would necessarily lower the value of each place the old functionaries formed a union amongst themselves and enraged swore on the Bible not to allow of this addition to their number but to resist all the persecutions which might ensue and should any one of them chance to forfeit his post by this resistance to combine to indemnify him for his loss	293.8868785413558
Now the following occurrences had taken place between the two contending parties	140.8074337069584
On the seventh of January between seven and eight hundred tradesmen had assembled in Paris to discuss a new tax which was to be levied on house property	264.6427868086647
They deputed ten of their number to wait upon the Duke of Orleans who according to his custom affected popularity	211.35344026064712
The duke received them and they informed him that they were resolved not to pay this tax even if they were obliged to defend themselves against its collectors by force of arms	111.11127704371808
They were listened to with great politeness by the duke who held out hopes of easier measures promised to speak in their behalf to the queen and dismissed them with the ordinary expression of royalty We will see what we can do	140.8870930246679
Two days afterward these same magistrates appeared before the cardinal and their spokesman addressed Mazarin with so much fearlessness and determination that the minister was astounded and sent the deputation away with the same answer as it had received from the Duke of Orleansthat he would see what could be done and in accordance with that intention a council of state was assembled and the superintendent of finance was summoned	188.04118154313127
This man named Emery was the object of popular detestation in the first place because he was superintendent of finance and every superintendent of finance deserved to be hated in the second place because he rather deserved the odium which he had incurred	359.82568287878263
He was the son of a banker at Lyons named Particelli who after becoming a bankrupt chose to change his name to Emery and Cardinal Richelieu having discovered in him great financial aptitude had introduced him with a strong recommendation to Louis XIII	507.36088330561535
under his assumed name in order that he might be appointed to the post he subsequently held	140.9348027129408
You surprise me exclaimed the monarch	23319.383755551527
I am rejoiced to hear you speak of Monsieur dEmery as calculated for a post which requires a man of probity	237.13053697982068
I was really afraid that you were going to force that villain Particelli upon me	325.35188999681253
Sire replied Richelieu rest assured that Particelli the man to whom your majesty refers has been hanged	570.7151542442117
Ah so much the better exclaimed the king	63.370507916011256
It is not for nothing that I am styled Louis the Just and he signed Emerys appointment	937.3065089546637
This was the same Emery who became eventually superintendent of finance	1181.0854954093377
He was sent for by the ministers and he came before them pale and trembling declaring that his son had very nearly been assassinated the day before near the palace	95.17828569857225
The mob had insulted him on account of the ostentatious luxury of his wife whose house was hung with red velvet edged with gold fringe	100.7390439627096
This lady was the daughter of Nicholas de Camus who arrived in Paris with twenty francs in his pocket became secretary of state and accumulated wealth enough to divide nine millions of francs among his children and to keep an income of forty thousand for himself	194.7957873670718
The fact was that Emerys son had run a great chance of being suffocated one of the rioters having proposed to squeeze him until he gave up all the gold he had swallowed	125.5963688956177
Nothing therefore was settled that day as Emerys head was not steady enough for business after such an occurrence	477.7183017023609
On the next day Mathieu Mol the chief president whose courage at this crisis says the Cardinal de Retz was equal to that of the Duc de Beaufort and the Prince de Condin other words of the two men who were considered the bravest in Francehad been attacked in his turn	187.62432799109044
The people threatened to hold him responsible for the evils that hung over them	215.55815247552263
But the chief president had replied with his habitual coolness without betraying either disturbance or surprise that should the agitators refuse obedience to the kings wishes he would have gallows erected in the public squares and proceed at once to hang the most active among them	406.5141549935504
To which the others had responded that they would be glad to see the gallows erected they would serve for the hanging of those detestable judges who purchased favor at court at the price of the peoples misery	320.80861104646016
On the eleventh the queen in going to mass at Notre Dame as she always did on Saturdays was followed by more than two hundred women demanding justice	411.0847438702132
These poor creatures had no bad intentions	534.6974580406244
They wished only to be allowed to fall on their knees before their sovereign and that they might move her to compassion but they were prevented by the royal guard and the queen proceeded on her way haughtily disdainful of their entreaties	150.1501364233773
At length parliament was convoked the authority of the king was to be maintained	84.7253588703544
One dayit was the morning of the day my story beginsthe king Louis XIV	307.9537267738032
then ten years of age went in state under pretext of returning thanks for his recovery from the smallpox to Notre Dame	335.9684289542251
He took the opportunity of calling out his guard the Swiss troops and the musketeers and he had planted them round the Palais Royal on the quays and on the Pont Neuf	161.82105923067468
After mass the young monarch drove to the Parliament House where upon the throne he hastily confirmed not only such edicts as he had already passed but issued new ones each one according to Cardinal de Retz more ruinous than the othersa proceeding which drew forth a strong remonstrance from the chief president Molwhilst President Blancmesnil and Councillor Broussel raised their voices in indignation against fresh taxes	836.6184873539881
The king returned amidst the silence of a vast multitude to the Palais Royal	82.7674529491996
All minds were uneasy most were foreboding many of the people used threatening language	2113.019974748609
At first indeed they were doubtful whether the kings visit to the parliament had been in order to lighten or increase their burdens but scarcely was it known that the taxes were to be still further increased when cries of Down with Mazarin Long live Broussel Long live Blancmesnil resounded through the city	338.30924386572536
For the people had learned that Broussel and Blancmesnil had made speeches in their behalf and although the eloquence of these deputies had been without avail it had none the less won for them the peoples goodwill	365.48045602856723
All attempts to disperse the groups collected in the streets or silence their exclamations were in vain	373.7482730876641
Orders had just been given to the royal guards and the Swiss guards not only to stand firm but to send out patrols to the streets of Saint Denis and Saint Martin where the people thronged and where they were the most vociferous when the mayor of Paris was announced at the Palais Royal	177.9528831388336
He was shown in directly he came to say that if these offensive precautions were not discontinued in two hours Paris would be under arms	249.27552012901702
Deliberations were being held when a lieutenant in the guards named Comminges made his appearance with his clothes all torn his face streaming with blood	201.4329502219343
The queen on seeing him uttered a cry of surprise and asked him what was going on	27.03170755902891
As the mayor had foreseen the sight of the guards had exasperated the mob	221.05670032690261
Comminges had arrested one of the ringleaders and had ordered him to be hanged near the cross of Du Trahoir but in attempting to execute this command the soldiery were attacked in the marketplace with stones and halberds the delinquent had escaped to the Rue des Lombards and rushed into a house	200.6232026084464
They broke open the doors and searched the dwelling but in vain	160.27272232653527
Comminges wounded by a stone which had struck him on the forehead had left a picket in the street and returned to the Palais Royal followed by a menacing crowd to tell his story	62.84599286388596
This account confirmed that of the mayor	273.89280882404375
The authorities were not in a condition to cope with serious revolt	778.4298502479818
Mazarin endeavored to circulate among the people a report that troops had only been stationed on the quays and on the Pont Neuf on account of the ceremonial of the day and that they would soon withdraw	95.13852441728385
In fact about four oclock they were all concentrated about the Palais Royal the courts and ground floors of which were filled with musketeers and Swiss guards and there awaited the outcome of all this disturbance	267.6819243630342
Such was the state of affairs at the very moment we introduced our readers to the study of Cardinal Mazarinonce that of Cardinal Richelieu	168.38714946953007
We have seen in what state of mind he listened to the murmurs from below which even reached him in his seclusion and to the guns the firing of which resounded through that room	208.92836221189074
All at once he raised his head his brow slightly contracted like that of a man who has formed a resolution he fixed his eyes upon an enormous clock that was about to strike ten and taking up a whistle of silver gilt that stood upon the table near him he shrilled it twice	97.51150390396064
A door hidden in the tapestry opened noiselessly and a man in black silently advanced and stood behind the chair on which Mazarin sat	172.12523584300374
Bernouin said the cardinal not turning round for having whistled he knew that it was his valetdechambre who was behind him what musketeers are now within the palace	171.07415377876526
Is there any officer belonging to this company in the antechamber	99.79225789904129
A man on whom we can depend I hope	136.25971069763068
Give me a uniform of one of these musketeers and help me to put it on	63.820193832434505
The valet went out as silently as he had entered and appeared in a few minutes bringing the dress demanded	101.79424801203969
The cardinal in deep thought and in silence began to take off the robes of state he had assumed in order to be present at the sitting of parliament and to attire himself in the military coat which he wore with a certain degree of easy grace owing to his former campaigns in Italy	130.52307521191673
When he was completely dressed he said	40.40270611259719
The valet went out of the room this time by the centre door but still as silently as before one might have fancied him an apparition	107.56786308631028
When he was left alone the cardinal looked at himself in the glass with a feeling of selfsatisfaction	117.27189686352595
Still youngfor he was scarcely fortysix years of agehe possessed great elegance of form and was above the middle height his complexion was brilliant and beautiful his glance full of expression his nose though large was well proportioned his forehead broad and majestic his hair of a chestnut color was curled slightly his beard which was darker than his hair was turned carefully with a curling iron a practice that greatly improved it	365.2150185477277
After a short time the cardinal arranged his shoulder belt then looked with great complacency at his hands which were most elegant and of which he took the greatest care and throwing on one side the large kid gloves tried on at first as belonging to the uniform he put on others of silk only	255.78437393632527
At this instant the door opened	3.163201429165478
An officer as he spoke entered the apartment	100.87149047752018
He was a man between thirtynine and forty years of age of medium height but a very well proportioned figure with an intellectual and animated physiognomy his beard black and his hair turning gray as often happens when people have found life either too gay or too sad more especially when they happen to be of swart complexion	364.426146671259
DArtagnan advanced a few steps into the apartment	24.872172479153658
How perfectly he remembered his former entrance into that very room Seeing however no one there except a musketeer of his own troop he fixed his eyes upon the supposed soldier in whose dress nevertheless he recognized at the first glance the cardinal	215.1034917770278
The lieutenant remained standing in a dignified but respectful posture such as became a man of good birth who had in the course of his life been frequently in the society of the highest nobles	145.12628001238556
The cardinal looked at him with a cunning rather than serious glance yet he examined his countenance with attention and after a momentary silence said	148.13266035972208
I am that individual replied the officer	71.22115720638057
Mazarin gazed once more at a countenance full of intelligence the play of which had been nevertheless subdued by age and experience and DArtagnan received the penetrating glance like one who had formerly sustained many a searching look very different indeed from those which were inquiringly directed on him at that instant	266.090885131527
Sir resumed the cardinal you are to come with me or rather I am to go with you	29.508560529725482
I am at your command my lord returned DArtagnan	364.88840427883304
I wish to visit in person the outposts which surround the Palais Royal do you suppose that there is any danger in so doing	182.70077865310265
Danger my lord exclaimed DArtagnan with a look of astonishment what danger	47.15482214680248
I am told that there is a general insurrection	251.92676143688692
The uniform of the kings musketeers carries a certain respect with it and even if that were not the case I would engage with four of my men to put to flight a hundred of these clowns	178.73337447014006
Did you witness the injury sustained by Comminges	1639.4614678095018
Monsieur de Comminges is in the guards and not in the musketeers	162.05239827817883
Which means I suppose that the musketeers are better soldiers than the guards	266.3507083529954
The cardinal smiled as he spoke	58.731130207954806
Every one likes his own uniform best my lord	687.2450622928644
Myself excepted and again Mazarin smiled for you perceive that I have left off mine and put on yours	158.82625883703773
Lord bless us this is modesty indeed cried DArtagnan	2616.197671006334
Had I such a uniform as your eminence possesses I protest I should be mightily content and I would take an oath never to wear any other costume	230.15886820478428
Yes but for tonights adventure I do nt suppose my dress would have been a very safe one	76.7426209356163
Give me my felt hat Bernouin	359101.6787563358
The valet instantly brought to his master a regimental hat with a wide brim	187.3099852570358
The cardinal put it on in military style	1752.1741564078584
Your horses are ready saddled in their stables are they not he said turning to DArtagnan	134.42323504980726
How many men does your eminence wish to escort you	94.59395447655064
You say that with four men you will undertake to disperse a hundred low fellows as it may happen that we shall have to encounter two hundred take eight	184.6241043470383
As many as my lord wishes	182.40616667977216
The valet held a waxlight the cardinal took a key from his bureau and opening the door of a secret stair descended into the court of the Palais Royal	71.43103533428078
In ten minutes Mazarin and his party were traversing the street Les Bons Enfants behind the theatre built by Richelieu expressly for the play of Mirame and in which Mazarin who was an amateur of music but not of literature had introduced into France the first opera that was ever acted in that country	335.8511278183721
The appearance of the town denoted the greatest agitation	1235.4134987048499
Numberless groups paraded the streets and whatever DArtagnan might think of it it was obvious that the citizens had for the night laid aside their usual forbearance in order to assume a warlike aspect	167.75580578128788
From time to time noises came in the direction of the public markets	108.51006455693155
The report of firearms was heard near the Rue Saint Denis and occasionally church bells began to ring indiscriminately and at the caprice of the populace	293.30210965263325
DArtagnan meantime pursued his way with the indifference of a man upon whom such acts of folly made no impression	80.67356319051578
When he approached a group in the middle of the street he urged his horse upon it without a word of warning and the members of the group whether rebels or not as if they knew with what sort of a man they had to deal at once gave place to the patrol	102.49392266281193
The cardinal envied that composure which he attributed to the habit of meeting danger but none the less he conceived for the officer under whose orders he had for the moment placed himself that consideration which even prudence pays to careless courage	374.4743696053637
On approaching an outpost near the Barriere des Sergens the sentinel cried out Who s there and DArtagnan answeredhaving first asked the word of the cardinalLouis and Rocroy	561.2165402224656
After which he inquired if Lieutenant Comminges were not the commanding officer at the outpost	859.7299282942778
The soldier replied by pointing out to him an officer who was conversing on foot his hand upon the neck of a horse on which the individual to whom he was talking sat	75.58317488696493
Here was the officer DArtagnan was seeking	165.12154246532657
Here is Monsieur Comminges said DArtagnan returning to the cardinal	178.34007984141084
He instantly retired from a feeling of respectful delicacy it was however evident that the cardinal was recognized by both Comminges and the other officers on horseback	183.0921409827317
Well done Guitant cried the cardinal to the equestrian I see plainly that notwithstanding the sixtyfour years that have passed over your head you are still the same man active and zealous	218.08537093813516
What were you saying to this youngster	4045.848710864563
My lord replied Guitant I was observing that we live in troublous times and that todays events are very like those in the days of the Ligue of which I heard so much in my youth	121.61979136587628
Are you aware that the mob have even suggested throwing up barricades in the Rue Saint Denis and the Rue Saint Antoine	259.7977206355185
And what was Comminges saying to you in reply my good Guitant	430.4472504668173
My lord said Comminges I answered that to compose a Ligue only one ingredient was wantingin my opinion an essential onea Duc de Guise moreover no generation ever does the same thing twice	1176.666301595005
No but they mean to make a Fronde as they call it said Guitant	209.49755291621298
And what is a Fronde inquired Mazarin	1810.0851192980638
My lord Fronde is the name the discontented give to their party	549.7651525044431
And what is the origin of this name	17.591610003073324
It seems that some days since Councillor Bachaumont remarked at the palace that rebels and agitators reminded him of schoolboys slingingqui frondentstones from the moats round Paris young urchins who run off the moment the constable appears only to return to their diversion the instant his back is turned	967.7968321021007
So they have picked up the word and the insurrectionists are called Frondeurs and yesterday every article sold was a la Fronde bread a la Fronde hats a la Fronde to say nothing of gloves pockethandkerchiefs and fans but listen	1030.2194341326242
At that moment a window opened and a man began to sing	74.87008005423237
A tempest from the Fronde Did blow today I think twill blow Sieur Mazarin away	8950.40549387936
My lord said Comminges who irritated by his wounds wished for revenge and longed to give back blow for blow shall I fire off a ball to punish that jester and to warn him not to sing so much out of tune in the future	346.20633512729853
And as he spoke he put his hand on the holster of his uncles saddlebow	188.80848048190742
Certainly not certainly not exclaimed Mazarin	3915.522750137913
Diavolo my dear friend you are going to spoil everythingeverything is going on famously	487.31360163926604
I know the French as well as if I had made them myself	25.979346180323322
They singlet them pay the piper	63042.309264258256
During the Ligue about which Guitant was speaking just now the people chanted nothing except the mass so everything went to destruction	707.8445896327889
Come Guitant come along and lets see if they keep watch at the QuinzeVingts as at the Barriere des Sergens	670.5592788336713
And waving his hand to Comminges he rejoined DArtagnan who instantly put himself at the head of his troop followed by the cardinal Guitant and the rest of the escort	129.6749938445238
Just so muttered Comminges looking after Mazarin	2552.240907084581
True I forgot provided he can get money out of the people that is all he wants	103.55837023717778
The street of Saint Honore when the cardinal and his party passed through it was crowded by an assemblage who standing in groups discussed the edicts of that memorable day	301.4923111911493
They pitied the young king who was unconsciously ruining his country and threw all the odium of his proceedings on Mazarin	274.6689983927353
Addresses to the Duke of Orleans and to Cond were suggested	635.4724451627089
Blancmesnil and Broussel seemed in the highest favor	178.53200449330967
DArtagnan passed through the very midst of this discontented mob just as if his horse and he had been made of iron	165.58451442008342
Mazarin and Guitant conversed together in whispers	3285.0400194049566
The musketeers who had already discovered who Mazarin was followed in profound silence	287.150840865525
In the street of Saint ThomasduLouvre they stopped at the barrier distinguished by the name of QuinzeVingts	250.11604618101921
Here Guitant spoke to one of the subalterns asking how matters were progressing	1121.62108742921
Ah captain said the officer everything is quiet hereaboutif I did not know that something is going on in yonder house	208.15269782842162
And he pointed to a magnificent hotel situated on the very spot whereon the Vaudeville now stands	768.3402855574597
In that hotel it is the Hotel Rambouillet cried Guitant	6590.162226887843
I really do nt know what hotel it is all I do know is that I observed some suspicious looking people go in there	206.6624130939643
Nonsense exclaimed Guitant with a burst of laughter those men must be poets	358.4530326021758
Come Guitant speak if you please respectfully of these gentlemen said Mazarin do nt you know that I was in my youth a poet I wrote verses in the style of Benserade	130.50908636344545
Yes I shall I repeat to you some of my verses	101.36951121957547
Just as you please my lord	50.045179981211774
Yes but you understand French and Mazarin laid his hand upon Guitants shoulder	471.2931059131603
My good my brave Guitant whatsoever command I may give you in that languagein Frenchwhatever I may order you to do will you not perform it	298.50150804731356
I have already answered that question in the affirmative but that command must come from the queen herself	167.6677241338834
Yes ah yes Mazarin bit his lips as he spoke I know your devotion to her majesty	76.11298986860633
I have been a captain in the queens guards for twenty years was the reply	131.00141966517637
En route Monsieur dArtagnan said the cardinal all goes well in this direction	207.34145230125662
DArtagnan in the meantime had taken the head of his detachment without a word and with that ready and profound obedience which marks the character of an old soldier	114.74762381909429
He led the way toward the hill of Saint Roche	164.08268516917474
The Rue Richelieu and the Rue Villedot were then owing to their vicinity to the ramparts less frequented than any others in that direction for the town was thinly inhabited thereabout	458.56561910023953
Who is in command here asked the cardinal	28.933634391258686
Diavolo Speak to him yourself for ever since you were deputed by me to arrest the Duc de Beaufort this officer and I have been on bad terms	60.4076018195796
He laid claim to that honor as captain of the royal guards	248.62288819194674
I am aware of that and I have told him a hundred times that he was wrong	32.582717290175054
The king could not give that order since at that time he was hardly four years old	110.98905232898844
Yes but I could give him the orderI Guitantand I preferred to give it to you	134.14237903761455
Guitant without reply rode forward and desired the sentinel to call Monsieur de Villequier	204.0265379404628
Ah so you are here cried the officer in the tone of illhumor habitual to him what the devil are you doing here	92.49201076959206
I wish to knowcan you tell me prayis anything fresh occurring in this part of the town	295.4731228769787
What do you mean People cry out Long live the king down with Mazarin That s nothing new no we ve been used to those acclamations for some time	339.83188472964713
And you sing chorus replied Guitant laughing	5333.581740898199
Faith I ve half a mind to do it	72.37418552802775
In my opinion the people are right and cheerfully would I give up five years of my paywhich I am never paid by the wayto make the king five years older	244.4517267956744
Really And pray what would come to pass supposing the king were five years older than he is	156.817316976848
As soon as ever the king comes of age he will issue his commands himself and tis far pleasanter to obey the grandson of Henry IV	329.62722445084495
than the son of Peter Mazarin	12857.361802862626
Sdeath I would die willingly for the king but supposing I happened to be killed on account of Mazarin as your nephew came near being today there could be nothing in Paradise however well placed I might be there that could console me for it	264.1195704884422
Well well Monsieur de Villequier Mazarin interposed I shall make it my care the king hears of your loyalty	553.9569177966945
Come gentlemen addressing the troop let us return	50.29342916066782
Stop exclaimed Villequier so Mazarin was here so much the better	39.619582136559345
I have been waiting for a long time to tell him what I think of him	17.895989842480553
I am obliged to you Guitant although your intention was perhaps not very favorable to me for such an opportunity	191.65338930961153
He turned away and went off to his post whistling a tune then popular among the party called the Fronde whilst Mazarin returned in a pensive mood toward the Palais Royal	506.170045487883
All that he had heard from these three different men Comminges Guitant and Villequier confirmed him in his conviction that in case of serious tumults there would be no one on his side except the queen and then Anne of Austria had so often deserted her friends that her support seemed most precarious	226.31024638576315
During the whole of this nocturnal ride during the whole time that he was endeavoring to understand the various characters of Comminges Guitant and Villequier Mazarin was in truth studying more especially one man	329.9716974553578
This man who had remained immovable as bronze when menaced by the mobnot a muscle of whose face was stirred either at Mazarins witticisms or by the jests of the multitudeseemed to the cardinal a peculiar being who having participated in past events similar to those now occurring was calculated to cope with those now on the eve of taking place	666.560939270998
The name of DArtagnan was not altogether new to Mazarin who although he did not arrive in France before the year 1634 or 1635 that is to say about eight or nine years after the events which we have related in a preceding narrative   fancied he had heard it pronounced as that of one who was said to be a model of courage address and loyalty	143.44070047754082
Possessed by this idea the cardinal resolved to know all about DArtagnan immediately of course he could not inquire from DArtagnan himself who he was and what had been his career he remarked however in the course of conversation that the lieutenant of musketeers spoke with a Gascon accent	196.28798743573185
Now the Italians and the Gascons are too much alike and know each other too well ever to trust what any one of them may say of himself so in reaching the walls which surrounded the Palais Royal the cardinal knocked at a little door and after thanking DArtagnan and requesting him to wait in the court of the Palais Royal he made a sign to Guitant to follow him	124.36847589252437
They both dismounted consigned their horses to the lackey who had opened the door and disappeared in the garden	22.786603706194857
My dear friend said the cardinal leaning as they walked through the garden on his friends arm you told me just now that you had been twenty years in the queens service	86.8359852251567
Now my dear Guitant I have often remarked that in addition to your courage which is indisputable and your fidelity which is invincible you possess an admirable memory	339.90261351009775
You have found that out have you my lord Deuce take itall the worse for me	563.9346491215167
There is no doubt but that one of the chief accomplishments of a courtier is to know when to forget	182.64561333422415
But you Guitant are not a courtier	909.2117022948418
You are a brave soldier one of the few remaining veterans of the days of Henry IV	125.32363072144494
Plague ont my lord have you brought me here to get my horoscope out of me	102.44342274169648
No I only brought you here to ask you returned Mazarin smiling if you have taken any particular notice of our lieutenant of musketeers	154.23280062656087
Monsieur dArtagnan I have had no occasion to notice him particularly he s an old acquaintance	160.62770132666233
De Trville knows him and esteems him very highly and De Trville as you know is one of the queens greatest friends	298.8333213849423
As a soldier the man ranks well he did his whole duty and even more at the siege of Rochelleas at Suze and Perpignan	446.1855386561392
But you know Guitant we poor ministers often want men with other qualities besides courage we want men of talent	1037.2863879170045
Pray was not Monsieur dArtagnan in the time of the cardinal mixed up in some intrigue from which he came out according to report quite cleverly	251.18163979690797
My lord as to the report you allude toGuitant perceived that the cardinal wished to make him speak outI know nothing but what the public knows	466.62787834574726
I never meddle in intrigues and if I occasionally become a confidant of the intrigues of others I am sure your eminence will approve of my keeping them secret	183.06748332406386
Ah he said some ministers are fortunate and find out all that they wish to know	88.26348559266958
My lord replied Guitant such ministers do not weigh men in the same balance they get their information on war from warriors on intrigues from intriguers	607.5203965821661
Consult some politician of the period of which you speak and if you pay well for it you will certainly get to know all you want	85.11531303225789
Eh pardieu said Mazarin with a grimace which he always made when spoken to about money	348.8757949380683
They will be paid if there is no way of getting out of it	36.11466524021561
Does my lord seriously wish me to name any one who was mixed up in the cabals of that day	94.88556320041673
By Bacchus rejoined Mazarin impatiently its about an hour since I asked you for that very thing woodenhead that you are	167.7705921035371
There is one man for whom I can answer if he will speak out	33.257466631112386
That s my concern I will make him speak	38.14566341567735
Ah my lord tis not easy to make people say what they do nt wish to let out	107.99444317128845
Pooh with patience one must succeed	308.0234671094335
Unfortunately he has disappeared these four or five years and I do nt know where he is	23.12903682135505
Well then how is it that your eminence complained just now of want of information	385.78275153868304
You think resumed Mazarin that Rochefort	150112.721782412
He was Cardinal Richelieus creature my lord	252.1908586140757
I warn you however his services will cost you something	132.10187916344572
The cardinal was lavish to his underlings	1377.3960785750178
Yes yes Guitant said Mazarin Richelieu was a great man a very great man but he had that defect	169.59895769297367
Thanks Guitant I shall benefit by your advice this very evening	135.71299556791718
Here they separated and bidding adieu to Guitant in the court of the Palais Royal Mazarin approached an officer who was walking up and down within that inclosure	117.13621401715461
It was DArtagnan who was waiting for him	14.4062300147319
Come hither said Mazarin in his softest voice I have an order to give you	47.97704366659865
DArtagnan bent low and following the cardinal up the secret staircase soon found himself in the study whence they had first set out	155.24337646389043
The cardinal seated himself before his bureau and taking a sheet of paper wrote some lines upon it whilst DArtagnan stood imperturbable without showing either impatience or curiosity	322.95930906748043
He was like a soldierly automaton or rather like a magnificent marionette	576.9389380213711
The cardinal folded and sealed his letter	99.26439068672737
Monsieur dArtagnan he said you are to take this dispatch to the Bastile and bring back here the person it concerns	180.2568381081119
You must take a carriage and an escort and guard the prisoner with the greatest care	150.80891279775219
DArtagnan took the letter touched his hat with his hand turned round upon his heel like a drillsergeant and a moment afterward was heard in his dry and monotonous tone commanding Four men and an escort a carriage and a horse	143.86575512488668
Five minutes afterward the wheels of the carriage and the horses shoes were heard resounding on the pavement of the courtyard	52.5328764812566
DArtagnan arrived at the Bastile just as it was striking halfpast eight	271.88280257619255
His visit was announced to the governor who on hearing that he came from the cardinal went to meet him and received him at the top of the great flight of steps outside the door	49.10931472437289
The governor of the Bastile was Monsieur du Tremblay the brother of the famous Capuchin Joseph that fearful favorite of Richelieus who went by the name of the Gray Cardinal	424.9121537839015
During the period that the Duc de Bassompierre passed in the Bastilewhere he remained for twelve long yearswhen his companions in their dreams of liberty said to each other As for me I shall go out of the prison at such a time and another at such and such a time the duke used to answer As for me gentlemen I shall leave only when Monsieur du Tremblay leaves meaning that at the death of the cardinal Du Tremblay would certainly lose his place at the Bastile and De Bassompierre regain his at court	214.72526385105834
His prediction was nearly fulfilled but in a very different way from that which De Bassompierre supposed for after the death of Richelieu everything went on contrary to expectation in the same way as before and Bassompierre had little chance of leaving his prison	234.01967398364826
Monsieur du Tremblay received DArtagnan with extreme politeness and invited him to sit down with him to supper of which he was himself about to partake	88.87151985458125
I should be delighted to do so was the reply but if I am not mistaken the words In haste are written on the envelope of the letter which I brought	74.41860547272076
You are right said Du Tremblay	135.5622549161379
Halloo major tell them to order Number 25 to come downstairs	19589.349258025446
The unhappy wretch who entered the Bastile ceased as he crossed the threshold to be a manhe became a number	223.64309718408387
DArtagnan shuddered at the noise of the keys he remained on horseback feeling no inclination to dismount and sat looking at the bars at the buttressed windows and the immense walls he had hitherto only seen from the other side of the moat but by which he had for twenty years been awestruck	120.73724997959341
I must leave you said Du Tremblay I am sent for to sign the release of a prisoner	98.19149597809322
I shall be happy to meet you again sir	69.62929618410018
May the devil annihilate me if I return thy wish murmured DArtagnan smiling as he pronounced the imprecation I declare I feel quite ill after only being five minutes in the courtyard	203.1416433637027
Go to go to I would rather die on straw than hoard up a thousand a year by being governor of the Bastile	492.12637100354976
He had scarcely finished this soliloquy before the prisoner arrived	607.3871566466884
On seeing him DArtagnan could hardly suppress an exclamation of surprise	260.4590058465724
The prisoner got into the carriage without seeming to recognize the musketeer	152.128870161163
Gentlemen thus DArtagnan addressed the four musketeers I am ordered to exercise the greatest possible care in guarding the prisoner and since there are no locks to the carriage I shall sit beside him	190.2064990348117
Monsieur de Lillebonne lead my horse by the bridle if you please	44.72528034252595
As he spoke he dismounted gave the bridle of his horse to the musketeer and placing himself by the side of the prisoner said in a voice perfectly composed To the Palais Royal at full trot	65.54266710560158
The carriage drove on and DArtagnan availing himself of the darkness in the archway under which they were passing threw himself into the arms of the prisoner	75.69184470058158
Rochefort he exclaimed you is it you indeed I am not mistaken	34.82768040620262
Ah my poor friend resumed DArtagnan not having seen you for four or five years I concluded you were dead	97.12851580926326
Ifaith said Rochefort there s no great difference I think between a dead man and one who has been buried alive now I have been buried alive or very nearly so	110.02180144512936
And for what crime are you imprisoned in the Bastile	123.56587810664425
Do you wish me to speak the truth	42.49042616287907
Well then I do nt know	5.798989939166948
Have you any suspicion of me Rochefort	2223.6083314960833
No on the honor of a gentleman but I can not be imprisoned for the reason alleged it is impossible	69.3727280742761
For stealing you Rochefort you are laughing at me	68.092420355858
You mean that this demands explanation do you not	40.96083023434165
Well this is what actually took place One evening after an orgy in Reinards apartment at the Tuileries with the Duc dHarcourt Fontrailles De Rieux and others the Duc dHarcourt proposed that we should go and pull cloaks on the Pont Neuf that is you know a diversion which the Duc dOrleans made quite the fashion	477.0314256036611
Were you crazy Rochefort at your age	70.34545719751601
And yet since the amusement seemed to me rather tame I proposed to Chevalier de Rieux that we should be spectators instead of actors and in order to see to advantage that we should mount the bronze horse	255.1167131286918
Thanks to the spurs which served as stirrups in a moment we were perched upon the croupe we were well placed and saw everything	328.181418115905
Four or five cloaks had already been lifted with a dexterity without parallel and not one of the victims had dared to say a word when some fool of a fellow less patient than the others took it into his head to cry out Guard and drew upon us a patrol of archers	191.41227336611553
Duc dHarcourt Fontrailles and the others escaped De Rieux was inclined to do likewise but I told him they would nt look for us where we were	192.47630669812978
He would nt listen put his foot on the spur to get down the spur broke he fell with a broken leg and instead of keeping quiet took to crying out like a gallowsbird	204.4677543167799
I then was ready to dismount but it was too late I descended into the arms of the archers	80.51974963153198
They conducted me to the Chatelet where I slept soundly being very sure that on the next day I should go forth free	174.84511606904263
The next day came and passed the day after a week I then wrote to the cardinal	64.5869726245756
The same day they came for me and took me to the Bastile	57.87899606837058
Do you believe it was because I committed the sacrilege of mounting en croupe behind Henry IV	1039.8929704145394
No you are right my dear Rochefort it could nt be for that but you will probably learn the reason soon	239.98902236416092
Ah indeed I forgot to ask youwhere are you taking me	392.15574293536565
What does he want with me	10.230853237109617
I did not even know that you were the person I was sent to fetch	49.23551472977738
A favorite no indeed cried DArtagnan	3266.556657731158
Ah my poor friend I am just as poor a Gascon as when I saw you at Meung twentytwo years ago you know alas and he concluded his speech with a deep sigh	186.4754415372422
Nevertheless you come as one in authority	1124.8925946614866
Because I happened to be in the antechamber when the cardinal called me by the merest chance	192.2075613507846
I am still a lieutenant in the musketeers and have been so these twenty years	69.75149141167512
Then no misfortune has happened to you	8.60466425038679
And what misfortune could happen to me To quote some Latin verses I have forgotten or rather never knew well the thunderbolt never falls on the valleys and I am a valley dear Rochefortone of the lowliest of the low	387.38888252525794
The same as ever my friend it is said that he is married to the queen	46.353655003093664
If not her husband he is unquestionably her lover	857.4679443360434
Rebuff Buckingham and consent to Mazarin	13248.26621468133
Just like the women replied DArtagnan coolly	26793.906351499394
Egad queens are the weakest of their sex when it comes to such things as these	129.56018296591506
de Beaufortis he still in prison	210.8740717408122
Oh nothing but that he might get me out of this if he were favorably inclined to me	132.85518806793803
You are probably nearer freedom than he is so it will be your business to get him out	63.39874414485818
And said the prisoner what talk is there of war with Spain	243.10351932854903
With Spain no answered DArtagnan but Paris	1196.5850496882035
What do you mean cried Rochefort	17719.755341936434
Do you hear the guns pray The citizens are amusing themselves in the meantime	250.76738297283453
And youdo you really think that anything could be done with these bourgeois	141.29082104244665
Yes they might do well if they had any leader to unite them in one body	193.4564718175642
How miserable not to be free	727.9982560433195
Since Mazarin has sent for you it is because he wants you	52.04685749195178
I congratulate you Many a long year has passed since any one has wanted to employ me so you see in what a situation I am	118.52094895723629
Make your complaints known that s my advice	296.8110802565707
Listen Rochefort let us make a compact	1493.4319154462735
We are friends are we not	4.51820780006349
Egad I bear the traces of our friendshipthree slits or slashes from your sword	658.5937896467789
Well if you should be restored to favor do nt forget me	219.32584818882995
On the honor of a Rochefort but you must do the like for me	214.57159154298512
Therefore whenever you find any opportunity of saying something in my behalf	130.00714879371964
I shall say it and you	29.28548858007646
Apropos are we to speak of your friends also Athos Porthos and Aramis or have you forgotten them	287.1647508570126
I do nt know we separated as you know	115.83026871675524
They are alive that s all that I can say about them from time to time I hear of them indirectly but in what part of the world they are devil take me if I know No on my honor I have not a friend in the world but you Rochefort	68.94742887842585
And the illustriouswhats the name of the lad whom I made a sergeant in Piedmonts regiment	246.86093684842322
I should nt wonder if he were at the head of the mob at this very moment	33.33314171022985
He married a woman who keeps a confectioners shop in the Rue des Lombards for he s a lad who was always fond of sweetmeats he s now a citizen of Paris	208.57848105952888
You ll see that that queer fellow will be a sheriff before I shall be a captain	164.9330296579032
Come dear DArtagnan look up a little Courage It is when one is lowest on the wheel of fortune that the merrygoround wheels and rewards us	652.2613677219354
This evening your destiny begins to change	140.20622856674157
Amen exclaimed DArtagnan stopping the carriage	382.7678628886533
What are you doing asked Rochefort	163303.62389229523
We are almost there and I want no one to see me getting out of your carriage we are supposed not to know each other	69.03502954838221
In five minutes the party entered the courtyard and DArtagnan led the prisoner up the great staircase and across the corridor and antechamber	137.37482251911752
As they stopped at the door of the cardinals study DArtagnan was about to be announced when Rochefort slapped him on his shoulder	116.82750051890017
DArtagnan let me confess to you what I ve been thinking about during the whole of my drive as I looked out upon the parties of citizens who perpetually crossed our path and looked at you and your four men with fiery eyes	164.67385179711115
I had only to cry out Help for you and for your companions to be cut to pieces and then I should have been free	89.46687245082575
Why did nt you do it asked the lieutenant	43.46767154582976
Did we not swear friendship Ah had any one but you been there I do nt say	186.70884431735223
Is it possible that Rochefort has become a better man than I am he said to himself	62.812744928700276
And he caused himself to be announced to the minister	78.44764648206167
de Rochefort enter said Mazarin eagerly on hearing their names pronounced and beg M	452.34137819239214
dArtagnan to wait I shall have further need of him	118.18706629275249
These words gave great joy to DArtagnan	335.3830011224053
As he had said it had been a long time since any one had needed him and that demand for his services on the part of Mazarin seemed to him an auspicious sign	98.81866827265745
Rochefort rendered suspicious and cautious by these words entered the apartment where he found Mazarin sitting at the table dressed in his ordinary garb and as one of the prelates of the Church his costume being similar to that of the abbs in that day excepting that his scarf and stockings were violet	192.61715241688776
As the door was closed Rochefort cast a glance toward Mazarin which was answered by one equally furtive from the minister	653.8374574100845
There was little change in the cardinal still dressed with sedulous care his hair well arranged and curled his person perfumed he looked owing to his extreme taste in dress only half his age	490.1991931317288
But Rochefort who had passed five years in prison had become old in the lapse of a few years the dark locks of this estimable friend of the defunct Cardinal Richelieu were now white the deep bronze of his complexion had been succeeded by a mortal pallor which betokened debility	206.77919738398685
As he gazed at him Mazarin shook his head slightly as much as to say This is a man who does not appear to me fit for much	71.23133420462861
After a pause which appeared an age to Rochefort Mazarin took from a bundle of papers a letter and showing it to the count he said	93.17060103392953
I find here a letter in which you sue for liberty Monsieur de Rochefort	375.9547999049088
Rochefort trembled in every limb at this question	133.74052217830047
But I thought he said that your eminence knew that circumstance better than any one	152.7653492410178
I Oh no There is a congestion of prisoners in the Bastile who were cooped up in the time of Monsieur de Richelieu I do nt even know their names	117.24259674087841
Yes but in regard to myself my lord it can not be so for I was removed from the Chatelet to the Bastile owing to an order from your eminence	102.3325536126713
Ah stay I fancy I remember it	87.76847295938687
Did you not once refuse to undertake a journey to Brussels for the queen	126.83411484566231
There is the true reason Idiot that I am though I have been trying to find it out for five years I never found it out	73.43779882768203
But I do not say it was the cause of your imprisonment	46.37432831301772
I merely ask you did you not refuse to go to Brussels for the queen whilst you had consented to go there to do some service for the late cardinal	116.62627735299958
That is the very reason I refused to go back to Brussels	90.10478390409166
I was there at a fearful moment	160.1493832781619
I was sent there to intercept a correspondence between Chalais and the archduke and even then when I was discovered I was nearly torn to pieces	259.50856193017285
How could I then return to Brussels I should injure the queen instead of serving her	173.89018827865502
Well since the best motives are liable to misconstruction the queen saw in your refusal nothing but a refusala distinct refusal she had also much to complain of you during the lifetime of the late cardinal yes her majesty the queen	410.8769881613693
Since I was a faithful servant my lord to Cardinal Richelieu during his life it stands to reason that now after his death I should serve you well in defiance of the whole world	239.1726344520583
With regard to myself Monsieur de Rochefort replied Mazarin I am not like Monsieur de Richelieu allpowerful	234.41425161666376
I am but a minister who wants no servants being myself nothing but a servant of the queens	223.22841147152351
Now the queen is of a sensitive nature	1294.8395493218095
Hearing of your refusal to obey her she looked upon it as a declaration of war and as she considers you a man of superior talent and consequently dangerous she desired me to make sure of you that is the reason of your being shut up in the Bastile	135.59236780023522
But your release can be managed	1262.08763242263
You are one of those men who can comprehend certain matters and having understood them can act with energy	315.4661986984123
Such was Cardinal Richelieus opinion my lord	154.10682876849475
The cardinal interrupted Mazarin was a great politician and therein shone his vast superiority over me	735.3651493000467
I am a straightforward simple man that s my great disadvantage	440.6184683700333
I am of a frankness of character quite French	953.7721739065518
Rochefort bit his lips in order to prevent a smile	78.85825771085662
I want friends I want faithful servants	10000.888235577513
When I say I want I mean the queen wants them	305.6103912922334
I do nothing without her commandspray understand that not like Monsieur de Richelieu who went on just as he pleased	304.1958919082669
So I shall never be a great man as he was but to compensate for that I shall be a good man Monsieur de Rochefort and I hope to prove it to you	56.720392620792474
Rochefort knew well the tones of that soft voice in which sounded sometimes a sort of gentle lisp like the hissing of young vipers	282.4346324215712
I am disposed to believe your eminence he replied though I have had but little evidence of that goodnature of which your eminence speaks	243.47442058010782
Do not forget that I have been five years in the Bastile and that no medium of viewing things is so deceptive as the grating of a prison	157.51909897444298
Ah Monsieur de Rochefort have I not told you already that I had nothing to do with that The queencannot you make allowances for the pettishness of a queen and a princess But that has passed away as suddenly as it came and is forgotten	121.98648990718613
I can easily suppose sir that her majesty has forgotten it amid the fetes and the courtiers of the Palais Royal but I who have passed those years in the Bastile	113.90538224023645
Ah mon Dieu my dear Monsieur de Rochefort do you absolutely think that the Palais Royal is the abode of gayety No	173.84569005054783
We have had great annoyances there	297.88634378463365
As for me I play my game squarely fairly and above board as I always do	1243.4383828512614
Let us come to some conclusion	8901.228229920942
Are you one of us Monsieur de Rochefort	493.8061117814614
I am very desirous of being so my lord but I am totally in the dark about everything	135.65191319492706
In the Bastile one talks politics only with soldiers and jailers and you have not an idea my lord how little is known of what is going on by people of that sort I am of Monsieur de Bassompierres party	162.21265806031954
Is he still one of the seventeen peers of France	227.67724452115098
He is dead sir a great loss	421.7327600187297
His devotion to the queen was boundless men of loyalty are scarce	2506.654515482201
I think so forsooth said Rochefort and when you find any of them you march them off to the Bastile	170.57596359315923
However there are plenty in the world but you do nt look in the right direction for them my lord	53.562447543725185
Ah my dear Monsieur de Rochefort how much you must have learned during your intimacy with the late cardinal Ah he was a great man	118.60152666576123
Will your eminence be angry if I read you a lesson	162.88398539169992
I never you know you may say anything to me	34.070716380325344
I try to be beloved not feared	1215.0951753277448
Well there is on the wall of my cell scratched with a nail a proverb which says Like master like servant	710.973089649672
It means that Monsieur de Richelieu was able to find trusty servants dozens and dozens of them	628.1200665707822
He the point aimed at by every poniard Richelieu who passed his life in warding off blows which were forever aimed at him	736.8491399686538
But he did ward them off said De Rochefort and the reason was that though he had bitter enemies he possessed also true friends	316.16126852836163
I have known persons he continuedfor he thought he might avail himself of the opportunity of speaking of DArtagnanwho by their sagacity and address have deceived the penetration of Cardinal Richelieu who by their valor have got the better of his guards and spies persons without money without support without credit yet who have preserved to the crowned head its crown and made the cardinal crave pardon	429.78222530238895
But those men you speak of said Mazarin smiling inwardly on seeing Rochefort approach the point to which he was leading him those men were not devoted to the cardinal for they contended against him	264.2657598298244
No in that case they would have met with more fitting reward	265.92905396996565
They had the misfortune to be devoted to that very queen for whom just now you were seeking servants	151.4309169713766
But how is it that you know so much of these matters	38.187806205668984
I know them because the men of whom I speak were at that time my enemies because they fought against me because I did them all the harm I could and they returned it to the best of their ability because one of them with whom I had most to do gave me a pretty swordthrust now about seven years ago the third that I received from the same hand it closed an old account	143.25769635770908
Ah said Mazarin with admirable suavity could I but find such men	728.7603467848503
My lord there has stood for six years at your very door a man such as I describe and during those six years he has been unappreciated and unemployed by you	176.05685310480783
That Gascon cried Mazarin with well acted surprise	10147.744462160452
That Gascon has saved a queen and made Monsieur de Richelieu confess that in point of talent address and political skill to him he was only a tyro	480.88613055264085
It is as I have the honor of telling it to your excellency	41.456203885262944
Tell me a little about it my dear Monsieur de Rochefort	76.64930598928778
That is somewhat difficult my lord said Rochefort with a smile	28.87021362434513
Then he will tell it me himself	261.5810890864537
Because the secret does not belong to him because as I have told you it has to do with a great queen	38.437712832896246
And he was alone in achieving an enterprise like that	851.821432668052
No my lord he had three colleagues three brave men men such as you were wishing for just now	249.52152623676002
And were these four men attached to each other true in heart really united	392.6305037800581
As if they had been one manas if their four hearts had pulsated in one breast	1124.7655260323027
You pique my curiosity dear Rochefort pray tell me the whole story	155.27839048932182
That is impossible but I will tell you a true story my lord	46.985745370979366
Pray do so I delight in stories cried the cardinal	518.6368330633564
Listen then returned Rochefort as he spoke endeavoring to read in that subtle countenance the cardinals motive	352.1310543764641
Once upon a time there lived a queena powerful monarchwho reigned over one of the greatest kingdoms of the universe and a minister and this minister wished much to injure the queen whom once he had loved too well	274.8839412033162
Do not try my lord you can not guess who it is all this happened long before you came into the country where this queen reigned	106.47252790949733
There came to the court an ambassador so brave so magnificent so elegant that every woman lost her heart to him and the queen had even the indiscretion to give him certain ornaments so rare that they could never be replaced by any like them	148.90900568584766
As these ornaments were given by the king the minister persuaded his majesty to insist upon the queens appearing in them as part of her jewels at a ball which was soon to take place	146.80976217121912
There is no occasion to tell you my lord that the minister knew for a fact that these ornaments had sailed away with the ambassador who was far away beyond seas	225.9748198484056
This illustrious queen had fallen low as the least of her subjectsfallen from her high estate	365.9535870528321
Well my lord four men resolved to save her	205.9933321758058
These four men were not princes neither were they dukes neither were they men in power they were not even rich	482.9405137847169
They were four honest soldiers each with a good heart a good arm and a sword at the service of those who wanted it	72.20502022930916
The minister knew of their departure and had planted people on the road to prevent them ever reaching their destination	258.36615348685467
Three of them were overwhelmed and disabled by numerous assailants one of them alone arrived at the port having either killed or wounded those who wished to stop him	241.04924437760548
He crossed the sea and brought back the set of ornaments to the great queen who was able to wear them on her shoulder on the appointed day and this very nearly ruined the minister	132.50417031588776
What do you think of that exploit my lord	442.4915959536997
It is magnificent said Mazarin thoughtfully	8048.364193458256
Well I know of ten such men	335.5826845245579
Mazarin made no reply he reflected	1104.3744021841403
You have nothing more to ask of me my lord said Rochefort	56.55368867571638
And you say that Monsieur dArtagnan was one of those four men	47.456926358352426
I leave it to Monsieur dArtagnan to name them my lord	560.9380250960629
They were his friends and not mine	341.06602242520285
He alone would have any influence with them I do not even know them under their true names	93.51304264020494
You suspect me Monsieur de Rochefort I want him and you and all to aid me	101.3259865487324
Begin with me my lord for after five or six years of imprisonment it is natural to feel some curiosity as to ones destination	150.2567026296493
You my dear Monsieur de Rochefort shall have the post of confidence you shall go to Vincennes where Monsieur de Beaufort is confined you will guard him well for me	151.39628146799117
The matter is that you have proposed to me what is impossible said Rochefort shaking his head with an air of disappointment	53.938153760035284
What impossible And why is it impossible	33.53959843997035
Because Monsieur de Beaufort is one of my friends or rather I am one of his	23.758545719696173
Have you forgotten my lord that it is he who answered for me to the queen	43.037056811956354
Since then Monsieur de Beaufort has become an enemy of the State	95.3471760708492
That may be my lord but since I am neither king nor queen nor minister he is not my enemy and I can not accept your offer	107.08934500969976
This then is what you call devotion I congratulate you	528.6748511425058
Your devotion does not commit you too far Monsieur de Rochefort	190.47159126118186
And then my lord continued Rochefort you understand that to emerge from the Bastile in order to enter Vincennes is only to change ones prison	338.20689466433663
Say at once that you are on the side of Monsieur de Beaufort that will be the most sincere line of conduct said Mazarin	97.75909429337449
My lord I have been so long shut up that I am only of one partyI am for fresh air	213.42769244803262
Employ me in any other way employ me even actively but let it be on the high roads	621.5906917372595
My dear Monsieur de Rochefort Mazarin replied in a tone of raillery you think yourself still a young man your spirit is that of the phoenix but your strength fails you	164.30634592954797
Believe me you ought now to take a rest	116.53620027921157
You decide then nothing about me my lord	58.0976771487634
On the contrary I have come to a decision	193.19817185285237
Call an officer of justice he said and stay close to me he added in a low tone	37.30490145491706
Mazarin wrote a few words which he gave to this man then he bowed	80.91002647895259
Adieu Monsieur de Rochefort he said	9.658607100598056
I see my lord I am to be taken back to the Bastile	38.29596109428857
I shall return thither my lord but it is a mistake on your part not to employ me	58.44742472857892
You the friend of my greatest foes Do nt suppose that you are the only person who can serve me Monsieur de Rochefort	211.15911854564666
I shall find many men as able as you are	65.95803159379204
I wish you may my lord replied De Rochefort	451.78817016961636
He was then reconducted by the little staircase instead of passing through the antechamber where DArtagnan was waiting	96.60759253444401
In the courtyard the carriage and the four musketeers were ready but he looked around in vain for his friend	69.54386000277238
Ah he muttered to himself this changes the situation and if there is still a crowd of people in the streets we will try to show Mazarin that we are still thank God good for something else than keeping guard over a prisoner and he jumped into the carriage with the alacrity of a man of fiveandtwenty	121.82439394648802
Anne of Austria at the Age of Fortysix	1111.3110461872323
When left alone with Bernouin Mazarin was for some minutes lost in thought	163.07450261275687
He had gained much information but not enough	260.8287112698948
Mazarin was a cheat at the cardtable	877.8482020863794
This is a detail preserved to us by Brienne	297.9138304269057
He called it using his advantages	8011.873323898771
He now determined not to begin the game with DArtagnan till he knew completely all his adversarys cards	511.3963891270882
My lord have you any commands asked Bernouin	5835.7162854492735
Light me I am going to the queen	68.08529919508193
Bernouin took up a candlestick and led the way	27.576483014355862
There was a secret communication between the cardinals apartments and those of the queen and through this corridor Mazarin passed whenever he wished to visit Anne of Austria	155.81718124477675
This secret passage is still to be seen in the Palais Royal	55.06312246108866
In the bedroom in which this passage ended Bernouin encountered Madame de Beauvais like himself intrusted with the secret of these subterranean love affairs and Madame de Beauvais undertook to prepare Anne of Austria who was in her oratory with the young king Louis XIV	266.8726615373264
Anne reclining in a large easychair her head supported by her hand her elbow resting on a table was looking at her son who was turning over the leaves of a large book filled with pictures	89.80455044882842
This celebrated woman fully understood the art of being dull with dignity	180.09093703176907
It was her practice to pass hours either in her oratory or in her room without either reading or praying	476.1883843663057
When Madame de Beauvais appeared at the door and announced the cardinal the child who had been absorbed in the pages of Quintus Curtius enlivened as they were by engravings of Alexanders feats of arms frowned and looked at his mother	192.37470613560336
Why he said does he enter without first asking for an audience	372.14485948306805
The prime minister she said is obliged in these unsettled days to inform the queen of all that is happening from time to time without exciting the curiosity or remarks of the court	209.93549853148838
But Richelieu never came in this manner said the pertinacious boy	315.522471101377
How can you remember what Monsieur de Richelieu did You were too young to know about such things	301.415734913623
I do not remember what he did but I have inquired and I have been told all about it	55.391710490220156
And who told you about it asked Anne of Austria with a movement of impatience	44.181532475071286
I know that I ought never to name the persons who answer my questions answered the child for if I do I shall learn nothing further	181.51797409120388
At this very moment Mazarin entered	70.36523376873699
The king rose immediately took his book closed it and went to lay it down on the table near which he continued standing in order that Mazarin might be obliged to stand also	61.93883454793564
Mazarin contemplated these proceedings with a thoughtful glance	147.08773751012617
They explained what had occurred that evening	151.11348643119354
He bowed respectfully to the king who gave him a somewhat cavalier reception but a look from his mother reproved him for the hatred which from his infancy Louis XIV	209.2300515955139
had entertained toward Mazarin and he endeavored to receive the ministers homage with civility	354.657114225534
Anne of Austria sought to read in Mazarins face the occasion of this unexpected visit since the cardinal usually came to her apartment only after every one had retired	165.585570713214
The minister made a slight sign with his head whereupon the queen said to Madame Beauvais	293.3103013925672
It is time for the king to go to bed call Laporte	213.2927611071781
The queen had several times already told her son that he ought to go to bed and several times Louis had coaxingly insisted on staying where he was but now he made no reply but turned pale and bit his lips with anger	138.2384867338973
In a few minutes Laporte came into the room	8.374650382883706
The child went directly to him without kissing his mother	168.11420905289924
Well Louis said Anne why do you not kiss me	19.417945080847883
I thought you were angry with me madame you sent me away	50.92637735878905
I do not send you away but you have had the smallpox and I am afraid that sitting up late may tire you	359.1322582704847
You had no fears of my being tired when you ordered me to go to the palace today to pass the odious decrees which have raised the people to rebellion	162.5439046557086
Sire interposed Laporte in order to turn the subject to whom does your majesty wish me to give the candle	59.09720744085058
To any one Laporte the child said and then added in a loud voice to any one except Mancini	172.71099111424255
Now Mancini was a nephew of Mazarins and was as much hated by Louis as the cardinal himself although placed near his person by the minister	193.43984476848522
And the king went out of the room without either embracing his mother or even bowing to the cardinal	75.11744194294641
Good said Mazarin I am glad to see that his majesty has been brought up with a hatred of dissimulation	56.6814274124872
Why do you say that asked the queen almost timidly	278.91071273406516
Why it seems to me that the way in which he left us needs no explanation	143.51735659695154
Besides his majesty takes no pains to conceal how little affection he has for me	122.47652257978005
That however does not hinder me from being entirely devoted to his service as I am to that of your majesty	56.16360096543389
I ask your pardon for him cardinal said the queen he is a child not yet able to understand his obligations to you	92.2512730174218
But continued the queen you have doubtless come for some important purpose	106.7825533589136
Mazarin sank into a chair with the deepest melancholy painted on his countenance	80.56228328346168
It is likely he replied that we shall soon be obliged to separate unless you love me well enough to follow me to Italy	71.66234405496452
Why cried the queen how is that	54.94881606256548
Because as they say in the opera of Thisbe The whole world conspires to break our bonds	590.5918044167682
You jest sir answered the queen endeavoring to assume something of her former dignity	246.37568705335866
Alas I do not madame rejoined Mazarin	22629.62594209998
The whole world conspires to break our bonds	537.1718082764143
Now as you are one of the whole world I mean to say that you also are deserting me	51.13306871378599
Heavens did I not see you the other day smile on the Duke of Orleans or rather at what he said	64.50781792414047
He said this madame Mazarin is a stumblingblock	288.3163651701704
Send him away and all will then be well	64.03417046419142
What do you wish me to do	5.586470556417882
Oh madame you are the queen	2453.538156983325
Queen forsooth when I am at the mercy of every scribbler in the Palais Royal who covers waste paper with nonsense or of every country squire in the kingdom	385.6075586258597
Nevertheless you have still the power of banishing from your presence those whom you do not like	91.15491390858757
That is to say whom you do not like returned the queen	36.31814686845335
I persons whom I do not like	11.39705924574464
Who sent away Madame de Chevreuse after she had been persecuted twelve years under the last reign	203.90459655868716
A woman of intrigue who wanted to keep up against me the spirit of cabal she had raised against M	159.29467607934356
Who dismissed Madame de Hautefort that friend so loyal that she refused the favor of the king that she might remain in mine	166.8067711344641
A prude who told you every night as she undressed you that it was a sin to love a priest just as if one were a priest because one happens to be a cardinal	210.4673339926989
Who ordered Monsieur de Beaufort to be arrested	119.9480808059072
An incendiary the burden of whose song was his intention to assassinate me	274.53083273173917
You see cardinal replied the queen that your enemies are mine	121.07191550486458
That is not enough madame it is necessary that your friends should be also mine	103.69549166449477
My friends monsieur The queen shook her head	79.95555348047083
Alas I have them no longer	14.064928905334876
How is it that you have no friends in your prosperity when you had many in adversity	199.37138932754112
It is because in my prosperity I forgot those old friends monsieur because I have acted like Queen Marie de Medicis who returning from her first exile treated with contempt all those who had suffered for her and being proscribed a second time died at Cologne abandoned by every one even by her own son	355.2884323185057
Well let us see said Mazarin is nt there still time to repair the evil Search among your friends your oldest friends	464.59007623384576
Alas I look around me in vain I have no influence with any one	38.889261153073804
Monsieur is as usual led by his favorite yesterday it was Choisy today it is La Riviere tomorrow it will be some one else	170.51020608350842
Monsieur le Prince is led by the coadjutor who is led by Madame de Guemenee	52.50563018086383
Therefore madame I ask you to look not among your friends of today but among those of other times	150.42877603065773
Among my friends of other times said the queen	129.63826965819095
Yes among your friends of other times among those who aided you to contend against the Duc de Richelieu and even to conquer him	108.44547778589667
What is he aiming at murmured the queen looking uneasily at the cardinal	243.04518556764097
Yes continued his eminence under certain circumstances with that strong and shrewd mind your majesty possesses aided by your friends you were able to repel the attacks of that adversary	396.2083465806984
Yes said Mazarin as women suffer in avenging themselves	1862.1931779717006
Come let us come to the point	25.683935088839156
Do you know Monsieur de Rochefort	435.4175211114439
One of my bitterest enemiesthe faithful friend of Cardinal Richelieu	839.3172535974331
I know that and we sent him to the Bastile said Mazarin	139.55687201081977
Is he at liberty asked the queen	130.52277061000947
No still there but I only speak of him in order that I may introduce the name of another man	48.097043449180354
Do you know Monsieur dArtagnan he added looking steadfastly at the queen	403.76756152884894
Anne of Austria received the blow with a beating heart	128.34578653439667
Has the Gascon been indiscreet she murmured to herself then said aloud	178.96067299254972
DArtagnan stop an instant the name seems certainly familiar	3087.90835600836
DArtagnan there was a musketeer who was in love with one of my women	41.85031990969456
Poor young creature she was poisoned on my account	127.66547865923236
That s all you know of him asked Mazarin	210.20824774459027
The queen looked at him surprised	5348.267573222233
You seem sir she remarked to be making me undergo a course of crossexamination	485.8043945270178
Which you answer according to your fancy replied Mazarin	481.9638356660255
Tell me your wishes and I will comply with them	63.801834039966735
The queen spoke with some impatience	545.3047820778393
Well madame said Mazarin bowing I desire that you give me a share in your friends as I have shared with you the little industry and talent that Heaven has given me	109.58611883020521
The circumstances are grave and it will be necessary to act promptly	80.19548243486464
I thought that we were finally quit of Monsieur de Beaufort	289.76502998040644
Yes you saw only the torrent that threatened to overturn everything and you gave no attention to the still water	317.6807570538168
There is however a proverb current in France relating to water which is quiet	607.7106297195722
Well then madame not a day passes in which I do not suffer affronts from your princes and your lordly servants all of them automata who do not perceive that I wind up the spring that makes them move nor do they see that beneath my quiet demeanor lies the still scorn of an injured irritated man who has sworn to himself to master them one of these days	235.6098693872388
We have arrested Monsieur de Beaufort but he is the least dangerous among them	121.06378765118637
There is the Prince de Cond	331.1813754172539
Yes madame often and often but pazienza as we say in Italy next after Monsieur de Cond comes the Duke of Orleans	276.157015940317
What are you saying The first prince of the blood the kings uncle	347.76090491883565
No not the first prince of the blood not the kings uncle but the base conspirator the soul of every cabal who pretends to lead the brave people who are weak enough to believe in the honor of a prince of the bloodnot the prince nearest to the throne not the kings uncle I repeat but the murderer of Chalais of Montmorency and of CinqMars who is playing now the same game he played long ago and who thinks that he will win the game because he has a new adversaryinstead of a man who threatened a man who smiles	220.04338936289656
But he is mistaken I shall not leave so near the queen that source of discord with which the deceased cardinal so often caused the anger of the king to rage above the boiling point	223.55305936870332
Anne blushed and buried her face in her hands	14.97811158023362
What am I to do she said bowed down beneath the voice of her tyrant	206.06708493143626
Endeavor to remember the names of those faithful servants who crossed the Channel in spite of Monsieur de Richelieu tracking the roads along which they passed by their blood to bring back to your majesty certain jewels given by you to Buckingham	251.05766832334675
Anne arose full of majesty and as if touched by a spring and looking at the cardinal with the haughty dignity which in the days of her youth had made her so powerful You are insulting me she said	85.85777129693483
I wish continued Mazarin finishing as it were the speech this sudden movement of the queen had cut I wish in fact that you should now do for your husband what you formerly did for your lover	163.48954039185767
Again that accusation cried the queen	713.2070469312345
I thought that calumny was stifled or extinct you have spared me till now but since you speak of it once for all I tell you	149.96282869912207
Madame I do not ask you to tell me said Mazarin astounded by this returning courage	188.00638255370484
I will tell you all replied Anne	1996.5089833161123
Listen there were in truth at that epoch four devoted hearts four loyal spirits four faithful swords who saved more than my lifemy honor	1172.058215626036
Ah you confess it exclaimed Mazarin	4006.2098192939793
Is it only the guilty whose honor is at the sport of others sir and can not women be dishonored by appearances Yes appearances were against me and I was about to suffer dishonor	307.94642391413277
However I swear I was not guilty I swear it by	53.640273773996086
The queen looked around her for some sacred object by which she could swear and taking out of a cupboard hidden in the tapestry a small coffer of rosewood set in silver and laying it on the altar	177.12225439699162
I swear she said by these sacred relics that Buckingham was not my lover	885.3092489966554
What relics are those by which you swear asked Mazarin smiling	460.62164631060296
The queen untied from around her throat a small golden key which hung there and presented it to the cardinal	87.93337100576609
Open sir she said and look for yourself	286.3072999780413
Mazarin opened the coffer a knife covered with rust and two letters one of which was stained with blood alone met his gaze	201.4312358573607
What are these things he asked	4.497201886906121
What are these things replied Anne with queenlike dignity extending toward the open coffer an arm despite the lapse of years still beautiful	1321.6235676982556
These two letters are the only ones I ever wrote to him	124.83526411988898
This knife is the knife with which Felton stabbed him	904.8302994779551
Read the letters and see if I have lied or spoken the truth	213.36880209963266
But Mazarin notwithstanding this permission instead of reading the letters took the knife which the dying Buckingham had snatched out of the wound and sent by Laporte to the queen	217.25061246002736
The blade was red for the blood had become rust after a momentary examination during which the queen became as white as the cloth which covered the altar on which she was leaning he put it back into the coffer with an involuntary shudder	115.03983460705186
It is well madame I believe your oath	302.7304910707293
No no read exclaimed the queen indignantly read I command you for I am resolved that everything shall be finished tonight and never will I recur to this subject again	332.50280181811075
Do you think she said with a ghastly smile that I shall be inclined to reopen this coffer to answer any future accusations	185.04511029371758
Mazarin overcome by this determination read the two letters	260.8317791508662
In one the queen asked for the ornaments back again	439.5680505822361
This letter had been conveyed by DArtagnan and had arrived in time	74.39384742466225
The other was that which Laporte had placed in the hands of the Duke of Buckingham warning him that he was about to be assassinated that communication had arrived too late	90.35497072543961
It is well madame said Mazarin nothing can gainsay such testimony	9226.947223345791
Sir replied the queen closing the coffer and leaning her hand upon it if there is anything to be said it is that I have always been ungrateful to the brave men who saved methat I have given nothing to that gallant officer DArtagnan you were speaking of just now but my hand to kiss and this diamond	124.32565445047419
As she spoke she extended her beautiful hand to the cardinal and showed him a superb diamond which sparkled on her finger	108.53303906013836
It appears she resumed that he sold ithe sold it in order to save me another timeto be able to send a messenger to the duke to warn him of his dangerhe sold it to Monsieur des Essarts on whose finger I remarked it	209.8426988323436
I bought it from him but it belongs to DArtagnan	288.8255267260521
Give it back to him sir and since you have such a man in your service make him useful	75.43262161471786
I will profit by the advice	254.23875640128324
And now added the queen her voice broken by her emotion have you any other question to ask me	139.5364557955456
Nothingthe cardinal spoke in his most conciliatory mannerexcept to beg of you to forgive my unworthy suspicions	660.7975584031076
I love you so tenderly that I can not help being jealous even of the past	91.76948126498714
A smile which was indefinable passed over the lips of the queen	23.976265661867398
Since you have no further interrogations to make leave me I beseech you she said	192.2077141036908
I wish after such a scene to be alone	115.76113866956842
Do you permit me to return	279.9110553696044
The cardinal took the queens hand and pressed it with an air of gallantry to his lips	33.456676626255465
Scarcely had he left her when the queen went into her sons room and inquired from Laporte if the king was in bed	137.36215690223176
Laporte pointed to the child who was asleep	43.934671722188156
Anne ascended the steps side of the bed and softly kissed the placid forehead of her son then she retired as silently as she had come merely saying to Laporte	121.56159382598554
Try my dear Laporte to make the king more courteous to Monsieur le Cardinal to whom both he and I are under such important obligations	481.3567454617908
Meanwhile the cardinal returned to his own room and after asking Bernouin who stood at the door whether anything had occurred during his absence and being answered in the negative he desired that he might be left alone	101.26853572368651
When he was alone he opened the door of the corridor and then that of the antechamber	34.49056052130889
There DArtagnan was asleep upon a bench	233.76428490585403
The cardinal went up to him and touched his shoulder	47.090588840544875
DArtagnan started awakened himself and as he awoke stood up exactly like a soldier under arms	677.5830400588003
I said Mazarin with his most smiling expression	116.23224247508448
I ask pardon of your eminence said DArtagnan but I was so fatigued	145.5713210691407
Do nt ask my pardon monsieur said Mazarin for you fatigued yourself in my service	148.18999276434585
Ah said he between his teeth is there truth in the proverb that fortune comes while one sleeps	610.2648252622606
Come come murmured DArtagnan Rochefort has kept his promise but where in the devil is he And he searched the cabinet even to the smallest recesses but there was no sign of Rochefort	172.0106179214784
Monsieur dArtagnan said the cardinal sitting down on a fauteuil you have always seemed to me to be a brave and honorable man	86.31140958177926
Possibly thought DArtagnan but he has taken a long time to let me know his thoughts nevertheless he bowed to the very ground in gratitude for Mazarins compliment	154.00704603951903
Well continued Mazarin the time has come to put to use your talents and your valor	222.61333734688628
There was a sudden gleam of joy in the officers eyes which vanished immediately for he knew nothing of Mazarins purpose	200.7438657996238
Order my lord he said I am ready to obey your eminence	38.06140387451297
Monsieur dArtagnan continued the cardinal you performed sundry superb exploits in the last reign	1771.3959409120532
Your eminence is too good to remember such trifles in my favor	248.74062188610782
It is true I fought with tolerable success	3289.228708419005
I do nt speak of your warlike exploits monsieur said Mazarin although they gained you much reputation they were surpassed by others	758.1866240597868
Well you do not reply resumed Mazarin	28022.156775434603
I am waiting my lord till you tell me of what exploits you speak	135.89429633114057
I speak of the adventureEh you know well what I mean	67.75744857547804
Alas no my lord replied DArtagnan surprised	7377.255882099591
You are discreetso much the better	97.03264739717751
I speak of that adventure in behalf of the queen of the ornaments of the journey you made with three of your friends	85.78311862597951
Aha thought the Gascon is this a snare or not Let me be on my guard	177.1609713204659
And he assumed a look of stupidity which Mendori or Bellerose two of the first actors of the day might have envied	294.9064113496519
Bravo cried Mazarin they told me that you were the man I wanted	29.598574536127884
Come let us see what you will do for me	13.199153232605969
Everything that your eminence may please to command me was the reply	219.64687543895212
You will do for me what you have done for the queen	39.42024711903689
Certainly DArtagnan said to himself he wishes to make me speak out	68.37690274277733
He s not more cunning than De Richelieu was Devil take him Then he said aloud	213.87132494395019
The queen my lord I do nt comprehend	317.5663065229124
You do nt comprehend that I want you and your three friends to be of use to me	63.47860129588103
Which of my friends my lord	47.86662297293481
Your three friendsthe friends of former days	1401.3125789955625
Of former days my lord In former days I had not only three friends I had thirty at twoandtwenty one calls every man ones friend	495.8187134863167
Well sir returned Mazarin prudence is a fine thing but today you might regret having been too prudent	164.9115658102769
My lord Pythagoras made his disciples keep silence for five years that they might learn to hold their tongues	323.4067902737421
But you have been silent for twenty years sir	85.9680540898314
Speak now the queen herself releases you from your promise	617.4469989191614
The queen said DArtagnan with an astonishment which this time was not pretended	142.8278756891199
Yes the queen And as a proof of what I say she commanded me to show you this diamond which she thinks you know	80.91509559924314
And so saying Mazarin extended his hand to the officer who sighed as he recognized the ring so gracefully given to him by the queen on the night of the ball at the Hotel de Ville and which she had repurchased from Monsieur des Essarts	72.20558134127937
I remember well that diamond which belonged to the queen	89.72708252978205
You see then that I speak to you in the queens name	56.18230554085291
Answer me without acting as if you were on the stage your interests are concerned in your so doing	72.48063557679954
Faith my lord it is very necessary for me to make my fortune your eminence has so long forgotten me	52.05455189754432
We need only a week to amend all that	359.02230797933083
Come you are accounted for you are here but where are your friends	67.58135400033453
I do not know my lord	135.75107372336777
We have parted company this long time all three have left the service	138.6731874483747
Where can you find them then	280.1089307703671
Wherever they are that s my business	216.299220934581
Well now what are your conditions if I employ you	118.05443651191543
Money my lord as much money as what you wish me to undertake will require	118.54974829180877
I remember too well how sometimes we were stopped for want of money and but for that diamond which I was obliged to sell we should have remained on the road	88.2714379323265
The devil he does Money and a large sum said Mazarin	134.58105870578274
Pray are you aware that the king has no money in his treasury	91.98345100486107
Do then as I did my lord	128.45662479895006
Trust me do nt let us try to do things cheaply	256.0265962652744
Great undertakings come poorly off with paltry means	850.7035468115032
Well returned Mazarin we will satisfy you	248.96030179609883
Richelieu thought DArtagnan would have given me five hundred pistoles in advance	55.57509435775344
You will then be at my service asked Mazarin	156.00273370792002
But if they refuse can I count on you	161.4068550599996
I have never accomplished anything alone said DArtagnan shaking his head	69.43749272117792
What shall I say to them by way of inducement to serve your eminence	262.67458430968276
You know them better than I	11.555719504191828
Adapt your promises to their respective characters	2574.2731616973606
That if they serve me as well as they served the queen my gratitude shall be magnificent	141.67017107000106
But what are we to do	9.381140494590682
Make your mind easy when the time for action comes you shall be put in full possession of what I require from you wait till that time arrives and find out your friends	107.24864525973547
My lord perhaps they are not in Paris	44.984084360733085
It is even probable that I shall have to make a journey	24.817060314213197
I am only a lieutenant of musketeers very poor and journeys cost money	652.9288540440057
My intention said Mazarin is not that you go with a great following my plans require secrecy and would be jeopardized by a too extravagant equipment	501.08670913177247
Still my lord I ca nt travel on my pay for it is now three months behind and I ca nt travel on my savings for in my twentytwo years of service I have accumulated nothing but debts	157.09662319777394
Mazarin remained some moments in deep thought as if he were fighting with himself then going to a large cupboard closed with a triple lock he took from it a bag of silver and weighing it twice in his hands before he gave it to DArtagnan	103.13100922637551
Take this he said with a sigh tis merely for your journey	217.5008654569945
If these are Spanish doubloons or even gold crowns thought DArtagnan we shall yet be able to do business together	362.7208623874243
He saluted the cardinal and plunged the bag into the depths of an immense pocket	121.40308601883791
Well then all is settled you are to set off said the cardinal	68.97254731767515
Apropos what are the names of your friends	14.264096976397703
The Count de la Fere formerly styled Athos Monsieur du Vallon whom we used to call Porthos the Chevalier dHerblay now the Abb dHerblay whom we styled Aramis	638.5260501859245
Younger sons he said who enlisted in the musketeers under feigned names in order not to lower their family names	655.1549346297461
If God willing these swords should be devoted to the service of your eminence said DArtagnan I shall venture to express a wish which is that in its turn the purse of your eminence may become light and theirs heavyfor with these three men your eminence may rouse all Europe if you like	167.3095348565122
These Gascons said the cardinal laughing almost beat the Italians in effrontery	1189.0207023808011
At all events answered DArtagnan with a smile almost as crafty as the cardinals they beat them when they draw their swords	134.82014883341998
He then withdrew and as he passed into the courtyard he stopped near a lamp and dived eagerly into the bag of money	80.22618907361628
Crown pieces onlysilver pieces I suspected it	364.4323945223603
Ah Mazarin Mazarin thou hast no confidence in me so much the worse for thee for harm may come of it	231.86461740014587
Meanwhile the cardinal was rubbing his hands in great satisfaction	126.92792355671111
A hundred pistoles a hundred pistoles for a hundred pistoles I have discovered a secret for which Richelieu would have paid twenty thousand crowns without reckoning the value of that diamondhe cast a complacent look at the ring which he had kept instead of restoring to DArtagnanwhich is worth at least ten thousand francs	128.65711934944696
He returned to his room and after depositing the ring in a casket filled with brilliants of every sort for the cardinal was a connoisseur in precious stones he called to Bernouin to undress him regardless of the noises of gunfire that though it was now near midnight continued to resound through Paris	277.38460113622
In the meantime DArtagnan took his way toward the Rue Tiquetonne where he lived at the Hotel de la Chevrette	32.72240955055751
We will explain in a few words how DArtagnan had been led to choose that place of residence	200.49750808936506
Years have elapsed many events have happened alas since in our romance of The Three Musketeers we took leave of DArtagnan at No	352.07141202698193
DArtagnan had not failed in his career but circumstances had been adverse to him	145.3191898414163
So long as he was surrounded by his friends he retained his youth and the poetry of his character	95.87762011500526
He was one of those fine ingenuous natures which assimilate themselves easily to the dispositions of others	644.7047553201138
Athos imparted to him his greatness of soul Porthos his enthusiasm Aramis his elegance	2848.28414759694
Had DArtagnan continued his intimacy with these three men he would have become a superior character	87.94643495016885
Athos was the first to leave him in order that he might retire to a little property he had inherited near Blois Porthos the second to marry an attorneys wife and lastly Aramis the third to take orders and become an abb	267.4870734414256
From that day DArtagnan felt lonely and powerless without courage to pursue a career in which he could only distinguish himself on condition that each of his three companions should endow him with one of the gifts each had received from Heaven	213.76253394483294
Notwithstanding his commission in the musketeers DArtagnan felt completely solitary	5353.38072228159
For a time the delightful remembrance of Madame Bonancieux left on his character a certain poetic tinge perishable indeed for like all other recollections in this world these impressions were by degrees effaced	622.6567662444651
A garrison life is fatal even to the most aristocratic organization and imperceptibly DArtagnan always in the camp always on horseback always in garrison became I know not how in the present age one would express it a typical trooper	575.7192324042875
His early refinement of character was not only not lost it grew even greater than ever but it was now applied to the little instead of to the great things of lifeto the martial condition of the soldiercomprised under the head of a good lodging a rich table a congenial hostess	235.33441623007474
These important advantages DArtagnan found to his own taste in the Rue Tiquetonne at the sign of the Roe	60.31340084087299
From the time DArtagnan took quarters in that hotel the mistress of the house a pretty and fresh looking Flemish woman twentyfive or twentysix years old had been singularly interested in him and after certain love passages much obstructed by an inconvenient husband to whom a dozen times DArtagnan had made a pretence of passing a sword through his body that husband had disappeared one fine morning after furtively selling certain choice lots of wine carrying away with him money and jewels	469.15851014911163
He was thought to be dead his wife especially who cherished the pleasing idea that she was a widow stoutly maintained that death had taken him	464.95350661074224
Therefore after the connection had continued three years carefully fostered by DArtagnan who found his bed and his mistress more agreeable every year each doing credit to the other the mistress conceived the extraordinary desire of becoming a wife and proposed to DArtagnan that he should marry her	332.02240752364787
Bigamy my dear Come now you do nt really wish it	119.36286154184553
But he is dead I am sure of it	17.784824706678275
He was a very contrary fellow and might come back on purpose to have us hanged	310.8760012617281
All right if he comes back you will kill him you are so skillful and so brave	109.35947134119155
Peste my darling another way of getting hanged	1007.8005435713461
She would have taken DArtagnan not only as her husband but as her God he was so handsome and had so fierce a mustache	177.634337344565
Then along toward the fourth year came the expedition of FrancheComte	1163.906514886888
DArtagnan was assigned to it and made his preparations to depart	160.93079052439322
There were then great griefs tears without end and solemn promises to remain faithfulall of course on the part of the hostess	195.86177704691602
DArtagnan was too grand to promise anything he purposed only to do all that he could to increase the glory of his name	126.46138731935844
As to that we know DArtagnans courage he exposed himself freely to danger and while charging at the head of his company he received a ball through the chest which laid him prostrate on the field of battle	206.01753980329843
He had been seen falling from his horse and had not been seen to rise every one therefore believed him to be dead especially those to whom his death would give promotion	142.21019797425078
One believes readily what he wishes to believe	80.39907465007639
Now in the army from the divisiongenerals who desire the death of the generalinchief to the soldiers who desire the death of the corporals all desire some ones death	231.63853896545857
But DArtagnan was not a man to let himself be killed like that	90.37863542942976
After he had remained through the heat of the day unconscious on the battlefield the cool freshness of the night brought him to himself	117.09099612755466
He gained a village knocked at the door of the finest house and was received as the wounded are always and everywhere received in France	113.66927973105662
He was petted tended cured and one fine morning in better health than ever before he set out for France	191.67659855965655
Once in France he turned his course toward Paris and reaching Paris went straight to Rue Tiquetonne	192.21684131016804
But DArtagnan found in his chamber the personal equipment of a man complete except for the sword arranged along the wall	268.5413036787944
So much the worse and so much the better	24.065594639775515
It need not be said that DArtagnan was still thinking of the husband	172.84414650965513
He made inquiries and discovered that the servants were new and that the mistress had gone for a walk	87.08614290798363
Of course naively replied the servant	268.27546651210605
If I had any money said DArtagnan to himself I would go away but I have none	48.49660892261984
I must stay and follow the advice of my hostess while thwarting the conjugal designs of this inopportune apparition	764.8375919761006
He had just completed this monologuewhich proves that in momentous circumstances nothing is more natural than the monologuewhen the servantmaid watching at the door suddenly cried out	496.161539620973
Ah see here is madame returning with monsieur	1760.3963439711702
DArtagnan looked out and at the corner of Rue Montmartre saw the hostess coming along hanging to the arm of an enormous Swiss who tiptoed in his walk with a magnificent air which pleasantly reminded him of his old friend Porthos	207.78873405491413
Is that monsieur said DArtagnan to himself	36.07153517575478
Oh oh he has grown a good deal it seems to me	37.135620777007645
And he sat down in the hall choosing a conspicuous place	587.8110758717863
The hostess as she entered saw DArtagnan and uttered a little cry whereupon DArtagnan judging that he had been recognized rose ran to her and embraced her tenderly	312.22350636834125
The Swiss with an air of stupefaction looked at the hostess who turned pale	60.561951451505685
Ah it is you monsieur What do you want of me she asked in great distress	75.43931002824614
Is monsieur your cousin Is monsieur your brother said DArtagnan not in the slightest degree embarrassed in the role he was playing	269.8410001305654
And without waiting for her reply he threw himself into the arms of the Helvetian who received him with great coldness	72.3763617233144
Who is that man he asked	3.6300522277392964
The hostess replied only by gasps	641398.7101039428
Who is that Swiss asked DArtagnan	20260.135101511532
Monsieur is going to marry me replied the hostess between two gasps	430.0829702313349
Your husband then is at last dead	150.0494446009319
How does that concern you replied the Swiss	466.9760372467511
It concerns me much said DArtagnan since you can not marry madame without my consent and since	82.7843293805103
And sinceI do not give it said the musketeer	72.72665113324246
The Swiss became as purple as a peony	98.63832622662068
He wore his elegant uniform DArtagnan was wrapped in a sort of gray cloak the Swiss was six feet high DArtagnan was hardly more than five the Swiss considered himself on his own ground and regarded DArtagnan as an intruder	278.5277111560644
Will you go away from here demanded the Swiss stamping violently like a man who begins to be seriously angry	240.81886670653876
I By no means said DArtagnan	10109.361507361593
Some one must go for help said a lad who could not comprehend that this little man should make a stand against that other man who was so large	96.91975273621027
DArtagnan with a sudden accession of wrath seized the lad by the ear and led him apart with the injunction	201.38873692737914
Stay you where you are and do nt you stir or I will pull this ear off	197.52933643467819
As for you illustrious descendant of William Tell you will straightway get together your clothes which are in my room and which annoy me and go out quickly to another lodging	203.32877656369868
The Swiss began to laugh boisterously	867296.1325216894
Ah very well said DArtagnan I see that you understand French	69.47311585986652
Come then and take a turn with me and I will explain	63.50489033681916
The hostess who knew DArtagnans skill with the sword began to weep and tear her hair	155.01857410610089
DArtagnan turned toward her saying Then send him away madame	1317.298757358946
Pooh said the Swiss who had needed a little time to take in DArtagnans proposal pooh who are you in the first place to ask me to take a turn with you	131.61427585729953
I am lieutenant in his majestys musketeers said DArtagnan and consequently your superior in everything only as the question now is not of rank but of quartersyou know the customcome and seek for yours the first to return will recover his chamber	478.5818323576531
DArtagnan led away the Swiss in spite of lamentations on the part of the hostess who in reality found her heart inclining toward her former lover though she would not have been sorry to give a lesson to that haughty musketeer who had affronted her by the refusal of her hand	123.41136660391082
It was night when the two adversaries reached the field of battle	145.16170464015
DArtagnan politely begged the Swiss to yield to him the disputed chamber the Swiss refused by shaking his head and drew his sword	131.42061548530793
Then you will lie here said DArtagnan	136.0092077632058
It is a wretched bed but that is not my fault and it is you who have chosen it	38.86461789375328
With these words he drew in his turn and crossed swords with his adversary	93.13595364104573
He had to contend against a strong wrist but his agility was superior to all force	516.1904483116341
The Swiss received two wounds and was not aware of it by reason of the cold but suddenly feebleness occasioned by loss of blood obliged him to sit down	151.9477765845877
There said DArtagnan what did I tell you Fortunately you wo nt be laid up more than a fortnight	78.47085385728856
Remain here and I will send you your clothes by the boy	78.49034294262202
Goodby Oh by the way you d better take lodging in the Rue Montorgueil at the Chat Qui Pelote	795.5756787558487
You will be well fed there if the hostess remains the same	146.71933466154903
Thereupon he returned in a lively mood to his room and sent to the Swiss the things that belonged to him	179.56128873517824
The boy found him sitting where DArtagnan had left him still overwhelmed by the coolness of his adversary	85.05707497962563
The boy the hostess and all the house had the same regard for DArtagnan that one would have for Hercules should he return to earth to repeat his twelve labors	303.3565272905737
But when he was alone with the hostess he said Now pretty Madeleine you know the difference between a Swiss and a gentleman	209.79110918893542
As for you you have acted like a barmaid	674.6953433001994
So much the worse for you for by such conduct you have lost my esteem and my patronage	158.22949717948356
I have driven away the Swiss to humiliate you but I shall lodge here no longer	253.54135818402605
I will not sleep where I must scorn	663.643426758632
Ho there boy Have my valise carried to the Muid dAmour Rue des Bourdonnais	3164.787764231978
In saying these words DArtagnan appeared at the same time majestic and grieved	104.37696211695186
The hostess threw herself at his feet asked his pardon and held him back with a sweet violence	94.61236381705989
What more need be said The spit turned the stove roared the pretty Madeleine wept DArtagnan felt himself invaded by hunger cold and love	2193.0168219961124
He pardoned and having pardoned he remained	173.4553585931896
And this explains how DArtagnan had quarters in the Rue Tiquetonne at the Hotel de la Chevrette	50.217734308350124
DArtagnan then returned home in thoughtful mood finding a somewhat lively pleasure in carrying Mazarins bag of money and thinking of that fine diamond which he had once called his own and which he had seen on the ministers finger that night	260.36507804049944
Should that diamond ever fall into my hands again he reflected I would turn it at once into money I would buy with the proceeds certain lands around my fathers chateau which is a pretty place well enough but with no land to it at all except a garden about the size of the Cemetery des Innocents and I should wait in all my glory till some rich heiress attracted by my good looks rode along to marry me	257.12870482411137
Then I should like to have three sons I should make the first a nobleman like Athos the second a good soldier like Porthos the third an excellent abb like Aramis	301.55640107152186
Faith that would be a far better life than I lead now but Monsieur Mazarin is a mean wretch who wo nt dispossess himself of his diamond in my favor	277.08201429260026
On entering the Rue Tiquetonne he heard a tremendous noise and found a dense crowd near the house	82.04592994548067
Oho said he is the hotel on fire On approaching the hotel of the Roe he found however that it was in front of the next house the mob was collected	270.08367801831724
The people were shouting and running about with torches	686.4881964283405
By the light of one of these torches DArtagnan perceived men in uniform	562.9128141945661
He asked what was going on	8.875246972594962
He was told that twenty citizens headed by one man had attacked a carriage which was escorted by a troop of the cardinals bodyguard but a reinforcement having come up the assailants had been put to flight and the leader had taken refuge in the hotel next to his lodgings the house was now being searched	242.56162851385528
In his youth DArtagnan had often headed the bourgeoisie against the military but he was cured of all those hotheaded propensities besides he had the cardinals hundred pistoles in his pocket so he went into the hotel without a word	249.86154019119257
There he found Madeleine alarmed for his safety and anxious to tell him all the events of the evening but he cut her short by ordering her to put his supper in his room and give him with it a bottle of good Burgundy	99.33798853223026
He took his key and candle and went upstairs to his bedroom	110.54237905452099
He had been contented for the convenience of the house to lodge in the fourth story and truth obliges us even to confess that his chamber was just above the gutter and below the roof	211.10231255410795
His first care on entering it was to lock up in an old bureau with a new lock his bag of money and then as soon as supper was ready he sent away the waiter who brought it up and sat down to table	63.73455516571641
Not to reflect on what had passed as one might fancy	447.5047744876296
No DArtagnan considered that things are never well done when they are not reserved to their proper time	140.48903462872863
He was hungry he supped he went to bed	29.48749827747044
Neither was he one of those who think that the necessary silence of the night brings counsel with it	156.8152453371329
In the night he slept but in the morning refreshed and calm he was inspired with his clearest views of everything	235.02319070688392
It was long since he had any reason for his mornings inspiration but he always slept all night long	239.46832253726492
At daybreak he awoke and took a turn around his room	59.319671282408855
In 43 he said just before the death of the late cardinal I received a letter from Athos	82.43559042833841
Where was I then Let me see	14.181008350112334
Oh at the siege of Besancon I was in the trenches	437.6433409570521
He told melet me thinkwhat was it That he was living on a small estatebut where I was just reading the name of the place when the wind blew my letter away I suppose to the Spaniards there s no use in thinking any more about Athos	155.56919197103824
Let me see with regard to Porthos I received a letter from him too	183.82555633208813
He invited me to a hunting party on his property in the month of September 1646	261.09286252667295
Unluckily as I was then in Bearn on account of my fathers death the letter followed me there	172.47259090593795
I had left Bearn when it arrived and I never received it until the month of April 1647 and as the invitation was for September 1646 I could nt accept it	266.9595783744174
Let me look for this letter it must be with my title deeds	189.1029044757832
DArtagnan opened an old casket which stood in a corner of the room and which was full of parchments referring to an estate during a period of two hundred years lost to his family	71.06465817193336
He uttered an exclamation of delight for the large handwriting of Porthos was discernible and underneath some lines traced by his worthy spouse	462.1728042572209
DArtagnan eagerly searched for the heading of this letter it was dated from the Chateau du Vallon	216.82721338016557
Porthos had forgotten that any other address was necessary in his pride he fancied that every one must know the Chateau du Vallon	127.28382225732855
Devil take the vain fellow said DArtagnan	332.0034970321739
However I had better find him out first since he ca nt want money	105.00142106860983
Athos must have become an idiot by this time from drinking	494.4192704545403
Aramis must have worn himself to a shadow of his former self by constant genuflexion	438.11692152005236
He cast his eyes again on the letter	38.486093422433584
I write by the same courier to our worthy friend Aramis in his convent	444.1933254582062
In his convent What convent There are about two hundred in Paris and three thousand in France and then perhaps on entering the convent he changed his name	99.21421706757214
Ah if I were but learned in theology I should recollect what it was he used to dispute about with the curate of Montdidier and the superior of the Jesuits when we were at Crevecoeur I should know what doctrine he leans to and I should glean from that what saint he has adopted as his patron	278.61030026446423
Well suppose I go back to the cardinal and ask him for a passport into all the convents one can find even into the nunneries It would be a curious idea and maybe I should find my friend under the name of Achilles	180.10285369648187
But no I should lose myself in the cardinals opinion	158.288767926048
Great people only thank you for doing the impossible what s possible they say they can effect themselves and they are right	205.0364363920022
But let us wait a little and reflect	381.65960921973357
I received a letter from him the dear fellow in which he even asked me for some small service which in fact I rendered him	140.6803665203746
Yes yes but now what did I do with that letter	69.77883712960539
DArtagnan thought a moment and then went to the wardrobe in which hung his old clothes	111.80479724902052
He looked for his doublet of the year 1648 and as he had orderly habits he found it hanging on its nail	369.9860089727806
He felt in the pocket and drew from it a paper it was the letter of Aramis	76.35713077038332
Monsieur DArtagnan You know that I have had a quarrel with a certain gentleman who has given me an appointment for this evening in the Place Royale	44.37874063037218
As I am of the church and the affair might injure me if I should share it with any other than a sure friend like you I write to beg that you will serve me as second	108.53441192745775
You will enter by the Rue Neuve Sainte Catherine under the second lamp on the right you will find your adversary	269.9361742118881
I shall be with mine under the third	152.21539781473584
DArtagnan tried to recall his remembrances	13467.62913110586
He had gone to the rendezvous had encountered there the adversary indicated whose name he had never known had given him a pretty swordstroke on the arm then had gone toward Aramis who at the same time came to meet him having already finished his affair	180.40004057757656
It is over Aramis had said	110.9256766527605
I think I have killed the insolent fellow	510.92452044192265
But dear friend if you ever need me you know that I am entirely devoted to you	46.376423106668405
Thereupon Aramis had given him a clasp of the hand and had disappeared under the arcades	141.9721227493547
So then he no more knew where Aramis was than where Athos and Porthos were and the affair was becoming a matter of great perplexity when he fancied he heard a pane of glass break in his room window	265.3858954011371
He thought directly of his bag and rushed from the inner room where he was sleeping	76.35560556866609
He was not mistaken as he entered his bedroom a man was getting in by the window	73.77632845179798
Ah you scoundrel cried DArtagnan taking the man for a thief and seizing his sword	93.07187726014737
Sir cried the man in the name of Heaven put your sword back into the sheath and do nt kill me unheard	97.97275523442791
I m no thief but an honest citizen well off in the world with a house of my own	139.36221496576437
My name isah but surely you are Monsieur dArtagnan	189.84578130308455
At your service sir said Planchet overwhelmed with joy if I were still capable of serving you	159.77749949247186
But why the devil dost thou run about the tops of houses at seven oclock of the morning in the month of January	76.9320723131551
Sir said Planchet you must know but perhaps you ought not to know	55.803426122311954
Tell us what returned DArtagnan but first put a napkin against the window and draw the curtains	181.11533924812534
Sir said the prudent Planchet in the first place are you on good terms with Monsieur de Rochefort	81.1114317342292
Perfectly one of my dearest friends	230.0589127926837
But what has De Rochefort to do with this manner you have of invading my room	93.60237824565334
Ah sir I must first tell you that Monsieur de Rochefort is	51.535657171815004
Egad I know where he is said DArtagnan	103.3194256812263
That is to say he was there replied Planchet	775.359189396905
But in returning thither last night when fortunately you did not accompany him as his carriage was crossing the Rue de la Ferronnerie his guards insulted the people who began to abuse them	120.71844060275033
The prisoner thought this a good opportunity for escape he called out his name and cried for help	110.18400676586926
I heard the name of Rochefort	40937.059453717266
I said in a loud voice that he was a prisoner a friend of the Duc de Beaufort who called for help	36.83981887986252
The people were infuriated they stopped the horses and cut the escort to pieces whilst I opened the doors of the carriage and Monsieur de Rochefort jumped out and soon was lost amongst the crowd	137.50522869780144
At this moment a patrol passed by	81.15395255668133
I was obliged to sound a retreat toward the Rue Tiquetonne I was pursued and took refuge in the house next to this where I have been concealed between two mattresses	142.79765799138053
This morning I ventured to run along the gutters and	285.9817756352555
Well interrupted DArtagnan I am delighted that De Rochefort is free but as for thee if thou shouldst fall into the hands of the kings servants they will hang thee without mercy	234.35780250241706
Nevertheless I promise thee thou shalt be hidden here though I risk by concealing thee neither more nor less than my lieutenancy if it was found out that I gave one rebel an asylum	339.4259752011145
Ah sir you know well I would risk my life for you	50.23958993402203
Thou mayst add that thou hast risked it Planchet	1180.3446931066112
I have not forgotten all I owe thee	93.98372004961776
Sit down there and eat in security	626.8822382056808
I see thee cast expressive glances at the remains of my supper	104.16064036180101
Yes sir for all I ve had since yesterday was a slice of bread and butter with preserves on it	250.79517038564032
Although I do nt despise sweet things in proper time and place I found the supper rather light	597.4832099672523
Ah sir you are going to save my life a second time cried Planchet	103.62399401599889
And he seated himself at the table and ate as he did in the merry days of the Rue des Fossoyeurs whilst DArtagnan walked to and fro and thought how he could make use of Planchet under present circumstances	165.1773681149492
While he turned this over in his mind Planchet did his best to make up for lost time at table	252.35646861506106
At last he uttered a sigh of satisfaction and paused as if he had partially appeased his hunger	177.85064116224714
Come said DArtagnan who thought that it was now a convenient time to begin his interrogations dost thou know where Athos is	222.62234029576152
The devil thou dost not Dost know where Porthos is	1184.2359581471906
The devil the devil the devil	2156.822008115346
But sir said Planchet with a look of shrewdness I know where Bazin is	142.4311377432679
What has he to do at Notre Dame	428.34800762774444
Bazin beadle at Notre Dame He must know where his master is	104.9695002483889
DArtagnan thought for a moment then took his sword and put on his cloak to go out	58.86896372504102
Sir said Planchet in a mournful tone do you abandon me thus to my fate Think if I am found out here the people of the house who have not seen me enter it will take me for a thief	81.96240654805662
I can do something better than that sir I can speak Flemish	307.29985791231337
Where the devil didst thou learn it	325.5639596545017
In Artois where I fought for years	190.51895426092008
Goeden morgen mynheer eth teen begeeray le weeten the ge sond heets omstand	11799.297853884535
Goodday sir I am anxious to know the state of your health	46.23894635642873
He calls that a language But never mind that will do capitally	1263.9718009215353
DArtagnan opened the door and called out to a waiter to desire Madeleine to come upstairs	341.84287938507373
When the landlady made her appearance she expressed much astonishment at seeing Planchet	455.09802856086833
My dear landlady said DArtagnan I beg to introduce to you your brother who is arrived from Flanders and whom I am going to take into my service	45.54625104235052
Wish your sister goodmorning Master Peter	43322.6013323452
Goeden day broder replied the astonished landlady	17540.295902548118
This is the case said DArtagnan this is your brother Madeleine you do nt know him perhaps but I know him he has arrived from Amsterdam	118.61151482500847
You must dress him up during my absence	358.83961076167594
When I return which will be in about an hour you must offer him to me as a servant and upon your recommendation though he does nt speak a word of French I take him into my service	71.93042353641034
That is to say I guess your wishes and that is all that s necessary said Madeleine	210.24615673740462
You are a precious creature my pretty hostess and I am much obliged to you	117.11506100561036
The next moment DArtagnan was on his way to Notre Dame	54.001740342575324
Touches upon the Strange Effects a Halfpistole may have	270.6903810763901
DArtagnan as he crossed the Pont Neuf congratulated himself on having found Planchet again for at that time an intelligent servant was essential to him nor was he sorry that through Planchet and the situation which he held in Rue des Lombards a connection with the bourgeoisie might be commenced at that critical period when that class were preparing to make war with the court party	291.2085748613435
It was like having a spy in the enemys camp	902.4654314333758
In this frame of mind grateful for the accidental meeting with Planchet pleased with himself DArtagnan reached Notre Dame	1416.1263393042886
He ran up the steps entered the church and addressing a verger who was sweeping the chapel asked him if he knew Monsieur Bazin	348.39948952580687
Monsieur Bazin the beadle said the verger	1413.753193567823
There he is attending mass in the chapel of the Virgin	143.03930706933076
DArtagnan nearly jumped for joy he had despaired of finding Bazin but now he thought since he held one end of the thread he would be pretty sure to reach the other end	123.15396104129672
He knelt down just opposite the chapel in order not to lose sight of his man and as he had almost forgotten his prayers and had omitted to take a book with him he made use of his time in gazing at Bazin	105.89926535763851
Bazin wore his dress it may be observed with equal dignity and saintly propriety	492.70734771317524
It was not difficult to understand that he had gained the crown of his ambition and that the silvermounted wand he brandished was in his eyes as honorable a distinction as the marshals baton which Cond threw or did not throw into the enemys line of battle at Fribourg	310.38186026436995
His person had undergone a change analogous to the change in his dress his figure had grown rotund and as it were canonical	354.7739769422816
The striking points of his face were effaced he had still a nose but his cheeks fattened out each took a portion of it unto themselves his chin had joined his throat his eyes were swelled up with the puffiness of his cheeks his hair cut straight in holy guise covered his forehead as far as his eyebrows	230.41374237635412
The officiating priest was just finishing mass whilst DArtagnan was looking at Bazin he pronounced the words of the holy Sacrament and retired giving the benediction which was received by the kneeling communicants to the astonishment of DArtagnan who recognized in the priest the coadjutor himself the famous Jean Francois Gondy who at that time having a presentiment of the part he was to play was beginning to court popularity by almsgiving	334.106794627729
It was to this end that he performed from time to time some of those early masses which the common people generally alone attended	243.33266538549603
DArtagnan knelt as well as the rest received his share of the benediction and made the sign of the cross but when Bazin passed in his turn with his eyes raised to Heaven and walking in all humility the very last DArtagnan pulled him by the hem of his robe	126.75644023128031
Bazin looked down and started as if he had seen a serpent	26.96757663016334
Monsieur dArtagnan he cried Vade retro Satanas	38540.07793817348
So my dear Bazin said the officer laughing this is the way you receive an old friend	84.49307918099764
Sir replied Bazin the true friends of a Christian are those who aid him in working out his salvation not those who hinder him in doing so	225.73859205784802
I do nt understand you Bazin nor can I see how I can be a stumblingblock in the way of your salvation said DArtagnan	165.44564467128532
You forget sir that you very nearly ruined forever that of my master and that it was owing to you that he was very nearly being damned eternally for remaining a musketeer whilst all the time his true vocation was the church	288.84618164203255
My dear Bazin you ought to perceive said DArtagnan from the place in which you find me that I am greatly changed in everything	94.390739175613
Age produces good sense and as I doubt not but that your master is on the road to salvation I want you to tell me where he is that he may help me to mine	63.27141029445058
Rather say to take him back with you into the world	23.778362661789576
Fortunately I do nt know where he is	21.127620582922802
How cried DArtagnan you do nt know where Aramis is	137.93152734308796
Formerly replied Bazin Aramis was his name of perdition	456.74450719934543
By Aramis is meant Simara which is the name of a demon	59.20430438129043
Happily for him he has ceased to bear that name	179.56081246624592
And therefore said DArtagnan resolved to be patient to the end it is not Aramis I seek but the Abb dHerblay	131.27402611234456
Come my dear Bazin tell me where he is	15.23374687738683
Did nt you hear me tell you Monsieur dArtagnan that I do nt know where he is	43.01893467100571
Yes certainly but to that I answer that it is impossible	44.40242927873024
It is nevertheless the truth monsieurthe pure truth the truth of the good God	393.75635113830987
DArtagnan saw clearly that he would get nothing out of this man who was evidently telling a falsehood in his pretended ignorance of the abode of Aramis but whose lies were bold and decided	227.49541599692574
Well Bazin said DArtagnan since you do not know where your master lives let us speak of it no more let us part good friends	56.41080260955909
Accept this halfpistole to drink to my health	59.326078367414986
I do not drinkBazin pushed away with dignity the officers handtis good only for the laity	1082.7532705802678
Incorruptible murmured DArtagnan I am unlucky and whilst he was lost in thought Bazin retreated toward the sacristy and even there he could not think himself safe until he had shut and locked the door behind him	188.8825099561256
DArtagnan was still in deep thought when some one touched him on the shoulder	71.30725148502755
He turned and was about to utter an exclamation of surprise when the other made to him a sign of silence	76.22937334559352
You here Rochefort he said in a low voice	5.119466646030011
Did you know that I am at liberty	27.893178875138588
I knew it from the fountainheadfrom Planchet	114179.86233647518
I came to thank God for my happy deliverance said Rochefort	511.91655000189996
And nothing more I suppose that is not all	33.09931189877819
To take my orders from the coadjutor and to see if we can not wake up Mazarin a little	152.29898764962377
A bad plan you ll be shut up again in the Bastile	56.30197612389452
Oh as to that I shall take care I assure you	35.14205640706018
The air the fresh free air is so good besides and Rochefort drew a deep breath as he spoke I am going into the country to make a tour	141.70883882046846
Stop cried DArtagnan I too am going	61.31017499526403
And if I may without impertinence askwhere are you going	748.9774295516618
Those that you asked about yesterday	479.948304014614
Athos Porthos and Aramisyou are looking for them	223.75354266636205
What then is there surprising in that	29.39433345442151
And in whose behalf are you looking for them	98.64656739306521
You are in no doubt on that score	77.14372980367953
Unfortunately I have no idea where they are	143.354796732259
And you have no way to get news of them Wait a week and I myself will give you some	103.13372242641745
I must find them within three days	50.96922208258827
Three days are a short time and France is large	240.8106142991393
No matter you know the word must with that word great things are done	352.3251082176694
And when do you set out	20.308794909593605
I am now on my road	51.72718212980809
Perhaps we shall meet on our road	19.4897221350552
Who knows Chance is so capricious	26392.917659395836
Adieu till we meet again Apropos should Mazarin speak to you about me tell him that I should have requested you to acquaint him that in a short time he will see whether I am as he says too old for action	109.86919342924718
And Rochefort went away with one of those diabolical smiles which used formerly to make DArtagnan shudder but DArtagnan could now see it without alarm and smiling in his turn with an expression of melancholy which the recollections called up by that smile could perhaps alone give to his countenance he said	134.40635629975642
Go demon do what thou wilt It matters little now to me	933.7448185894253
There s no second Constance in the world	6.615299184294052
On his return to the cathedral DArtagnan saw Bazin who was conversing with the sacristan	439.2927677603476
Bazin was making with his spare little short arms ridiculous gestures	14711.07419285757
DArtagnan perceived that he was enforcing prudence with respect to himself	1714.3098178929965
DArtagnan slipped out of the cathedral and placed himself in ambuscade at the corner of the Rue des Canettes it was impossible that Bazin should go out of the cathedral without his seeing him	99.46506487638263
In five minutes Bazin made his appearance looking in every direction to see if he were observed but he saw no one	50.634201250265804
Calmed by appearances he ventured to walk on through the Rue Notre Dame	255.36365582628503
Then DArtagnan rushed out of his hiding place and arrived in time to see Bazin turn down the Rue de la Juiverie and enter in the Rue de la Calandre a respectable looking house and this DArtagnan felt no doubt was the habitation of the worthy beadle	167.86720469248002
Afraid of making any inquiries at this house DArtagnan entered a small tavern at the corner of the street and asked for a cup of hypocras	74.14508137159245
This beverage required a good halfhour to prepare	692.8823776470867
And DArtagnan had time therefore to watch Bazin unsuspected	8633.534577267506
He perceived in the tavern a pert boy between twelve and fifteen years of age whom he fancied he had seen not twenty minutes before under the guise of a chorister	165.07911748152193
He questioned him and as the boy had no interest in deceiving DArtagnan learned that he exercised from six oclock in the morning until nine the office of chorister and from nine oclock till midnight that of a waiter in the tavern	159.15705688974464
Whilst he was talking to this lad a horse was brought to the door of Bazins house	169.58957064901867
Look said the boy there s our beadle who is going a journey	209.55152671826244
And where is he going asked DArtagnan	593.3134694455761
Half a pistole if you can find out said DArtagnan	116.93888180702673
For me cried the boy his eyes sparkling with joy if I can find out where Bazin is going That is not difficult	106.82428816720979
You are not joking are you	6.134296882058449
No on the honor of an officer there is the halfpistole and he showed him the seductive coin but did not give it him	234.53846206298977
Just the very way not to know	20.02937632617183
Wait till he is set out and then marry come up ask and find out	266.7335854243186
The halfpistole is ready and he put it back again into his pocket	66.70395889286465
I understand said the child with that jeering smile which marks especially the gamin de Paris	468.3982880536873
They had not long to wait	149.39063955530978
Five minutes afterward Bazin set off on a full trot urging on his horse by the blows of a parapluie which he was in the habit of using instead of a riding whip	142.4447307796046
Scarcely had he turned the corner of the Rue de la Juiverie when the boy rushed after him like a bloodhound on full scent	135.9099842337272
Before ten minutes had elapsed the child returned	180.32974739487574
Well answered the boy the thing is done	265.93048656676274
Give it me that I may see it is not false	54.04693661128431
The child put the piece of money into his pocket	18.79446866453371
And now where is he gone inquired DArtagnan	2133.0333833991763
Ah faith there was no great cunning necessary	1524.6263594797492
I knew the horse he rode it belonged to the butcher who lets it out now and then to M	189.41522620835542
Now I thought that the butcher would not let his horse out like that without knowing where it was going	124.35288462741804
And he answered that Monsieur Bazin went to Noisy	1201.7425518967038
He goes two or three times a week	130.86981443897403
I think so truly my nurse lives there	2506.178602892877
Is there a convent at Noisy	40854.92241457506
Is nt there a great and grand onethe convent of Jesuits	1808.7058105610135
DArtagnan wrote the childs name in his tablets	170.3499980092698
Please sir said the boy do you think I can gain any more halfpistoles in any way	55.72672805079056
And having got out all he wanted he paid for the hypocras which he did not drink and went quickly back to the Rue Tiquetonne	89.40422293116815
DArtagnan Going to a Distance to discover Aramis	997.9204695921027
On entering the hotel DArtagnan saw a man sitting in a corner by the fire	39.45460897542135
It was Planchet but so completely transformed thanks to the old clothes that the departing husband had left behind that DArtagnan himself could hardly recognize him	232.59290162557696
Madeleine introduced him in presence of all the servants	15.41921668173598
Planchet addressed the officer with a fine Flemish phrase the officer replied in words that belonged to no language at all and the bargain was concluded Madeleines brother entered DArtagnans service	961.5162260584289
The plan adopted by DArtagnan was soon perfected	1763.0645093627409
He resolved not to reach Noisy in the day for fear of being recognized he had therefore plenty of time before him for Noisy is only three or four leagues from Paris on the road to Meaux	153.62348355062176
He began his day by breakfasting substantiallya bad beginning when one wants to employ the head but an excellent precaution when one wants to work the body and about two oclock he had his two horses saddled and followed by Planchet he quitted Paris by the Barriere de la Villete	319.3362353629783
A most active search was still prosecuted in the house near the Hotel de la Chevrette for the discovery of Planchet	98.76556937798415
At about a league and a half from the city DArtagnan finding that in his impatience he had set out too soon stopped to give the horses breathing time	222.33789935919623
The inn was full of disreputable looking people who seemed as if they were on the point of commencing some nightly expedition	293.4737900962097
A man wrapped in a cloak appeared at the door but seeing a stranger he beckoned to his companions and two men who were drinking in the inn went out to speak to him	70.89765733056177
DArtagnan on his side went up to the landlady praised her winewhich was a horrible production from the country of Montreuiland heard from her that there were only two houses of importance in the village one of these belonged to the Archbishop of Paris and was at that time the abode of his niece the Duchess of Longueville the other was a convent of Jesuits and was the propertya by no means unusual circumstanceof these worthy fathers	253.12990284926067
At four oclock DArtagnan recommenced his journey	81.75213191068809
He proceeded slowly and in deep reverie	225.30084539325452
Planchet also was lost in thought but the subject of their reflections was not the same	74.3282914646743
One word which their landlady had pronounced had given a particular turn to DArtagnans deliberations this was the name of Madame de Longueville	154.118281577437
That name was indeed one to inspire imagination and produce thought	1617.6314446441527
Madame de Longueville was one of the highest ladies in the realm she was also one of the greatest beauties at court	189.29843780691164
She had formerly been suspected of an intimacy of too tender a nature with Coligny who for her sake had been killed in a duel in the Place Royale by the Duc de Guise	101.64786732726397
She was now connected by bonds of a political nature with the Prince de Marsillac the eldest son of the old Duc de Rochefoucauld whom she was trying to inspire with an enmity toward the Duc de Cond her brotherinlaw whom she now hated mortally	166.41358522605438
DArtagnan thought of all these matters	1165.8401686485006
He remembered how at the Louvre he had often seen as she passed by him in the full radiance of her dazzling charms the beautiful Madame de Longueville	186.53184260308115
He thought of Aramis who without possessing any greater advantages than himself had formerly been the lover of Madame de Chevreuse who had been to a former court what Madame de Longueville was in that day and he wondered how it was that there should be in the world people who succeed in every wish some in ambition others in love whilst others either from chance or from illluck or from some natural defect or impediment remain halfway upon the road toward fulfilment of their hopes and expectations	250.75015716130378
He was confessing to himself that he belonged to the latter unhappy class when Planchet approached and said	230.61251755039018
I will lay a wager your honor that you and I are thinking of the same thing	68.28607921201879
I doubt it Planchet replied DArtagnan but what are you thinking of	46.940845441610655
I am thinking sir of those desperate looking men who were drinking in the inn where we rested	155.32021789503952
Well what does your instinct tell you now	95.45107162210489
Sir my instinct told me that those people were assembled there for some bad purpose and I was reflecting on what my instinct had told me in the darkest corner of the stable when a man wrapped in a cloak and followed by two other men came in	123.68404207133601
Ah ah said DArtagnan Planchets recital agreeing with his own observations	1330.204349926739
One of these two men said He must certainly be at Noisy or be coming there this evening for I have seen his servant	149.0258684176639
Art thou sure said the man in the cloak	40.06181624913132
If he is herethis is what the other man saidlets see decidedly what to do with him	409.4181112060209
What to do with him answered the prince	140.56372557453457
Yes he s not a man to allow himself to be taken anyhow hell defend himself	433.4555172756691
Well we must try to take him alive	109.32847020146231
Have you cords to bind him with and a gag to stop his mouth	140.65458820233752
Remember that he will most likely be disguised as a horseman	253.3894331765797
Yes yes my lord do nt be uneasy	105.99009589622749
You will assure us that justice	626.9692301778206
Yes yes I answer for all that the prince said	127.91487377566605
Well then well do our best	17.386438039210827
Having said that they went out of the stable	33.7749717595881
Well what matters all that to us said DArtagnan	215.74747198011838
This is one of those attempts that happen every day	547.8457643379278
Are you sure that we are not its objects	166.91455028892136
I have seen his servant said one and that applies very well to me	235.3416523376531
He must certainly be at Noisy or be coming there this evening said the other and that applies very well to you	208.89014994420856
Then the prince said Take notice that in all probability he will be disguised as a cavalier which seems to me to leave no room for doubt since you are dressed as a cavalier and not as an officer of musketeers	88.16574359074951
Now then what do you say to that	40.06076162028557
Alas my dear Planchet said DArtagnan sighing we are unfortunately no longer in those times in which princes would care to assassinate me	378.66684931490755
Those were good old days never fearthese people owe us no grudge	2384.370308463663
I can answer for it they do not	50.27721509818039
Well we wo nt speak of it any more then and Planchet took his place in DArtagnans suite with that sublime confidence he had always had in his master which even fifteen years of separation had not destroyed	157.97710025559735
They had traveled onward about half a mile when Planchet came close up to DArtagnan	289.32163368157467
Stop sir look yonder he whispered do nt you see in the darkness something pass by like shadows I fancy I hear horses feet	361.61652632632934
The ground is soaking wet yet I fancy as thou sayest that I see something	431.17936853707766
At this moment the neighing of a horse struck his ear coming through darkness and space	135.34037974667874
There are men somewhere about but that s of no consequence to us said DArtagnan let us ride onward	314.4257956061696
At about halfpast eight oclock they reached the first houses in Noisy every one was in bed and not a light was to be seen in the village	80.81933626125803
The obscurity was broken only now and then by the still darker lines of the roofs of houses	209.28437086371372
Here and there a dog barked behind a door or an affrighted cat fled precipitately from the midst of the pavement to take refuge behind a pile of faggots from which retreat her eyes would shine like peridores	401.006928382243
These were the only living creatures that seemed to inhabit the village	431.9795956434869
Toward the middle of the town commanding the principal open space rose a dark mass separated from the rest of the world by two lanes and overshadowed in the front by enormous limetrees	250.280762513375
DArtagnan looked attentively at the building	4878.656904660764
This he said to Planchet must be the archbishops chateau the abode of the fair Madame de Longueville but the convent where is that	199.93264805132785
The convent your honor is at the other end of the village I know it well	50.90144461237261
Well then Planchet gallop up to it whilst I tighten my horses girth and come back and tell me if there is a light in any of the Jesuits windows	223.47581925197704
In about five minutes Planchet returned	161.53125883037666
Sir he said there is one window of the convent lighted up	268.654118111958
Hem If I were a Frondeur said DArtagnan I should knock here and should be sure of a good supper	172.33482739332922
If I were a monk I should knock yonder and should have a good supper there too whereas tis very possible that between the castle and the convent we shall sleep on hard beds dying with hunger and thirst	450.4210765158302
Yes added Planchet like the famous ass of Buridan	2276.6749744729864
Hush replied DArtagnan the light no longer burns in yonder window	1438.9182528913702
Do you hear nothing whispered Planchet	14863.76756864599
There came a sound like a whirlwind at the same time two troops of horsemen each composed of ten men sallied forth from each of the lanes which encompassed the house and surrounded DArtagnan and Planchet	311.29040829980744
Heyday cried DArtagnan drawing his sword and taking refuge behind his horse are you not mistaken is it really for us that you mean your attack	74.09691058847336
Here he is we have him cried the horsemen rushing on DArtagnan with naked swords	866.2924265389372
Do nt let him escape said a loud voice	22.087506420998512
No my lord be assured we shall not	28.84882972386026
DArtagnan thought it was now time for him to join in the conversation	64.22894395069521
Halloo gentlemen he called out in his Gascon accent what do you want what do you demand	49.79704248226888
That thou shalt soon know shouted a chorus of horsemen	1409.8213304280177
Stop stop cried he whom they had addressed as my lord tis not his voice	350.6447031170165
Ah just so gentlemen pray do people get into a passion at random at Noisy Take care for I warn you that the first man that comes within the length of my swordand my sword is longI rip him up	256.0255662647479
The chieftain of the party drew near	118.63563269161024
What are you doing here he asked in a lofty tone as that of one accustomed to command	83.5187300370262
And youwhat are you doing here replied DArtagnan	396.61584660913405
Be civil or I shall beat you for although one may not choose to proclaim oneself one insists on respect suitable to ones rank	1334.4651868850408
You do nt choose to discover yourself because you are the leader of an ambuscade returned DArtagnan but with regard to myself who am traveling quietly with my own servant I have not the same reasons as you have to conceal my name	155.21731231360974
Enough enough what is your name	43.738418266344674
I shall tell you my name in order that you may know where to find me my lord or my prince as it may suit you best to be called said our Gascon who did not choose to seem to yield to a threat	91.7556378650123
Lieutenant in the kings musketeers said the voice you are Monsieur dArtagnan	90.15920669012583
Then you came here to defend him	106.37027265750838
It seems said DArtagnan that whilst I thought I was coming to Noisy I have entered without suspecting it into the kingdom of mysteries	225.7173805272525
Come replied the same lofty tone answer Are you waiting for him underneath these windows Did you come to Noisy to defend him	372.7056571349012
I am waiting for no one replied DArtagnan who was beginning to be angry	41.9593596147432
I propose to defend no one but myself and I shall defend myself vigorously I give you warning	129.11369670219386
Very well said the voice go away from here and leave the place to us	62.459864252707234
Go away from here said DArtagnan whose purposes were in conflict with that order that is not so easy since I am on the point of falling and my horse too through fatigue unless indeed you are disposed to offer me a supper and a bed in the neighborhood	111.90126227483472
Eh monsieur said DArtagnan I beg you will have a care what you say for if you utter another word like that be you marquis duke prince or king I will thrust it down your throat do you hear	194.96468525375337
Well well rejoined the leader there s no doubt tis a Gascon who is speaking and therefore not the man we are looking for	133.3392860993766
Our blow has failed for tonight let us withdraw	531.7934571253068
We shall meet again Master dArtagnan continued the leader raising his voice	359.2155629019014
Yes but never with the same advantages said DArtagnan in a tone of raillery for when you meet me again you will perhaps be alone and there will be daylight	81.71560503490588
Very good very good said the voice	36.84312406663447
And the troop grumbling angrily disappeared in the darkness and took the road to Paris	23.295665861459383
DArtagnan and Planchet remained for some moments still on the defensive then as the noise of the horsemen became more and more distant they sheathed their swords	159.70888411108456
Thou seest simpleton said DArtagnan to his servant that they wished no harm to us	77.63521100149616
Ifaith I neither know nor care	2755.819579182198
What I do care for now is to make my way into the Jesuits convent so to horse and let us knock at their door	222.11997578177485
Happen what will the devil take them they ca nt eat us	129.23685327203543
Planchet had just done the same when an unexpected weight fell upon the back of the horse which sank down	100.89557184857033
Hey your honor cried Planchet I ve a man behind me	106.96765920687824
DArtagnan turned around and plainly saw two human forms on Planchets horse	2430.366748370448
Tis then the devil that pursues he cried drawing his sword and preparing to attack the new foe	492.24266759330965
No no dear DArtagnan said the figure tis not the devil tis Aramis gallop fast Planchet and when you come to the end of the village turn swiftly to the left	384.08078835120483
And Planchet with Aramis behind him set off at full gallop followed by DArtagnan who began to think he was in the merry maze of some fantastic dream	106.05458611961635
At the extremity of the village Planchet turned to the left in obedience to the orders of Aramis and stopped underneath the window which had light in it	159.06793232583559
Aramis alighted and clapped his hands three times	47.600455065719835
Immediately the window was opened and a ladder of rope was let down from it	120.43446226811287
My friend said Aramis if you like to ascend I shall be delighted to receive you	42.24891039642814
Ah said DArtagnan is that the way you return to your apartment	79.26202242497142
After nine at night pardieu said Aramis the rule of the convent is very severe	119.15819289352336
Pardon me my dear friend said DArtagnan I think you said pardieu	103.474109265586
Do you think so said Aramis smiling it is possible	95.31525031953842
You have no idea my dear fellow how one acquires bad habits in these cursed convents or what evil ways all these men of the church have with whom I am obliged to live	252.00468247411553
But will you not go up	34.192188236029985
Pass on before me I beg of you	11.7845834042333
As the late cardinal used to say to the late king only to show you the way sire	155.98458197057008
And Aramis ascended the ladder quickly and reached the window in an instant	58.343121434644864
DArtagnan followed but less nimbly showing plainly that this mode of ascent was not one to which he was accustomed	204.40465787040364
I beg your pardon said Aramis noticing his awkwardness if I had known that I was to have the honor of your visit I should have procured the gardeners ladder but for me alone this is good enough	98.59225657525842
Sir said Planchet when he saw DArtagnan on the summit of the ladder this way is easy for Monsieur Aramis and even for you in case of necessity I might also climb up but my two horses can not mount the ladder	176.31424253533876
Take them to yonder shed my friend said Aramis pointing to a low building on the plain there you will find hay and straw for them then come back here and clap your hands three times and we will give you wine and food	143.69872569511134
Marry forsooth people do nt die of hunger here	57.969145417695536
And Aramis drawing in the ladder closed the window	297.04488051247785
Never was there an apartment at the same time more warlike and more elegant	83.04232729944191
At each corner were arranged trophies presenting to view swords of all sorts and on the walls hung four great pictures representing in their ordinary military costume the Cardinal de Lorraine the Cardinal de Richelieu the Cardinal de la Valette and the Archbishop of Bordeaux	519.3734847207492
Exteriorly nothing in the room showed that it was the habitation of an abb	70.42513531307442
The hangings were of damask the carpets from Alencon and the bed especially had more the look of a fine ladys couch with its trimmings of fine lace and its embroidered counterpane than that of a man who had made a vow that he would endeavor to gain Heaven by fasting and mortification	207.85806560816508
You are examining my den said Aramis	149.17897235324796
Ah my dear fellow excuse me I am lodged like a Chartreux	177.74255851170506
But what are you looking for	25.548220952175363
I am looking for the person who let down the ladder	95.12987800001997
I see no one and yet the ladder did nt come down of itself	296.71194680079617
But continued Aramis Bazin is a well trained servant and seeing that I was not alone he discreetly retired	453.02755891180027
Sit down my dear friend and let us talk	39.028272345961405
And Aramis pushed forward a large easychair in which DArtagnan stretched himself out	448.8530283085891
In the first place you will sup with me will you not asked Aramis	43.705724356277976
Yes if you really wish it said DArtagnan and even with great pleasure I confess the journey has given me a devil of an appetite	131.3286555157646
Ah my poor friend said Aramis you will find meagre fare you were not expected	273.66272881276564
Am I then threatened with the omelet of Crevecoeur	674.1605755131055
Oh let us hope said Aramis that with the help of God and of Bazin we shall find something better than that in the larder of the worthy Jesuit fathers	130.22083176905298
The door opened and Bazin entered on perceiving the musketeer he uttered an exclamation that was almost a cry of despair	66.95445386164545
My dear Bazin said DArtagnan I am delighted to see with what wonderful composure you can tell a lie even in church	310.46037532439595
Sir replied Bazin I have been taught by the good Jesuit fathers that it is permitted to tell a falsehood when it is told in a good cause	143.71837353245812
So far well said Aramis we are dying of hunger	69.44290365040358
Serve us up the best supper you can and especially give us some good wine	262.54757542814195
Bazin bowed low sighed and left the room	16.950639073856024
Now we are alone dear Aramis said DArtagnan tell me how the devil you managed to alight upon the back of Planchets horse	206.75300648218226
Ifaith answered Aramis as you see from Heaven	158.34791721928076
From Heaven replied DArtagnan shaking his head you have no more the appearance of coming from thence than you have of going there	75.60957421281618
My friend said Aramis with a look of imbecility on his face which DArtagnan had never observed whilst he was in the musketeers if I did not come from Heaven at least I was leaving Paradise which is almost the same	86.97053644213631
Here then is a puzzle for the learned observed DArtagnan until now they have never been able to agree as to the situation of Paradise some place it on Mount Ararat others between the rivers Tigris and Euphrates it seems that they have been looking very far away for it while it was actually very near	255.02055644767506
Paradise is at Noisy le Sec upon the site of the archbishops chateau	599.3655261222691
People do not go out from it by the door but by the window one does nt descend here by the marble steps of a peristyle but by the branches of a limetree and the angel with a flaming sword who guards this elysium seems to have changed his celestial name of Gabriel into that of the more terrestrial one of the Prince de Marsillac	192.168695409855
Aramis burst into a fit of laughter	4.563699600501859
You were always a merry companion my dear DArtagnan he said and your witty Gascon fancy has not deserted you	254.37018804500372
Yes there is something in what you say nevertheless do not believe that it is Madame de Longueville with whom I am in love	41.84254721045163
A plague ont I shall not do so	12.665917444840836
After having been so long in love with Madame de Chevreuse you would hardly lay your heart at the feet of her mortal enemy	98.7111345676928
Yes replied Aramis with an absent air yes that poor duchess I once loved her much and to do her justice she was very useful to us	156.41919982440027
Eventually she was obliged to leave France	433.379913752293
He was a relentless enemy that damned cardinal continued Aramis glancing at the portrait of the old minister	496.64059632180357
He had even given orders to arrest her and would have cut off her head had she not escaped with her waitingmaidpoor Kitty I have heard that she met with a strange adventure in I do nt know what village with I do nt know what cur of whom she asked hospitality and who having but one chamber and taking her for a cavalier offered to share it with her	119.04315449997776
For she had a wonderful way of dressing as a man that dear Marie I know only one other woman who can do it as well	171.09067138837412
So they made this song about her Laboissiere dis moi	5296.978304084788
You know it do nt you	2.394087251330141
Aramis immediately complied and sang the song in a very lively manner	80.92067061023216
Bravo cried DArtagnan you sing charmingly dear Aramis	21839.431585351667
I do not perceive that singing masses has spoiled your voice	2821.8695501571965
My dear DArtagnan replied Aramis you understand when I was a musketeer I mounted guard as seldom as I could now when I am an abb I say as few masses as I can	142.81975490973437
But to return to our duchess	33732.40470024634
Whichthe Duchess de Chevreuse or the Duchess de Longueville	106.1361317593611
Have I not already told you that there is nothing between me and the Duchess de Longueville Little flirtations perhaps and that s all	207.76314307732295
No I spoke of the Duchess de Chevreuse did you see her after her return from Brussels after the kings death	221.66177526810824
Yes said Aramis I saw her also at that time	132.22869695669928
I gave her good advice by which she did not profit	88.7449962611914
I ventured to tell her that Mazarin was the lover of Anne of Austria	80.28367266003373
She would nt believe me saying that she knew Anne of Austria who was too proud to love such a worthless coxcomb	145.24403858659997
After that she plunged into the cabal headed by the Duke of Beaufort and the coxcomb arrested De Beaufort and banished Madame de Chevreuse	298.87453669698107
You know resumed DArtagnan that she has had leave to return to France	100.04460657561921
Yes she is come back and is going to commit some fresh folly or another	139.34613104400214
Oh but this time perhaps she will follow your advice	64.56528471141351
Oh this time returned Aramis I have nt seen her she is much changed	119.9699220197277
In that respect unlike you my dear Aramis for you are still the same you have still your beautiful dark hair still your elegant figure still your feminine hands which are admirably suited to a prelate	231.18305716201903
Yes replied Aramis I am extremely careful of my appearance	448.44360758791703
Do you know that I am growing old I am nearly thirtyseven	449.793991999943
Mind AramisDArtagnan smiled as he spokesince we are together again let us agree on one point what age shall we be in future	307.2380069949939
Formerly I was your junior by two or three years and if I am not mistaken I am turned forty years old	39.30888781990164
Indeed Then tis I who am mistaken for you have always been a good chronologist	77.05407008374806
By your reckoning I must be fortythree at least	231.86746092540994
The devil I am Do nt let it out at the Hotel Rambouillet it would ruin me replied the abb	76.56805505236744
Do nt be afraid said DArtagnan	6195.230234158548
Why what in the world cried Aramis is that animal Bazin doing Bazin Hurry up there you rascal we are mad with hunger and thirst	984.6119041970721
Bazin entered at that moment carrying a bottle in each hand	145.05790331618564
At last said Aramis we are ready are we	110.86165434928606
Yes monsieur quite ready said Bazin but it took me some time to bring up all the	93.93594174360565
Because you always think you have on your shoulders your beadles robe and spend all your time reading your breviary	385.20890631596217
But I give you warning that if in polishing your chapel utensils you forget how to brighten up my sword I will make a great fire of your blessed images and will see that you are roasted on it	314.9366367630927
Bazin scandalized made a sign of the cross with the bottle in his hand	33.849339577661894
DArtagnan more surprised than ever at the tone and manners of the Abb dHerblay which contrasted so strongly with those of the Musketeer Aramis remained staring with wideopen eyes at the face of his friend	184.11552973643833
Bazin quickly covered the table with a damask cloth and arranged upon it so many things gilded perfumed appetizing that DArtagnan was quite overcome	270.98236777661924
But you expected some one then asked the officer	120.04004621847237
Oh said Aramis I always try to be prepared and then I knew you were seeking me	46.93356989474636
From Master Bazin to be sure he took you for the devil my dear fellow and hastened to warn me of the danger that threatened my soul if I should meet again a companion so wicked as an officer of musketeers	110.25914774365918
Oh monsieur said Bazin clasping his hands supplicatingly	143.73730154566618
Come no hypocrisy you know that I do nt like it	36.28095390376859
You will do much better to open the window and let down some bread a chicken and a bottle of wine to your friend Planchet who has been this last hour killing himself clapping his hands	123.60690301200607
Planchet in fact had bedded and fed his horses and then coming back under the window had repeated two or three times the signal agreed upon	135.49093143558773
Bazin obeyed fastened to the end of a cord the three articles designated and let them down to Planchet who then went satisfied to his shed	207.61169798062156
The two friends sat down and Aramis began to cut up fowls partridges and hams with admirable skill	434.66599928040597
The deuce cried DArtagnan do you live in this way always	48.496340577180064
The coadjutor has given me dispensations from fasting on the jours maigres on account of my health then I have engaged as my cook the cook who lived with Lafolloneyou know the man I meanthe friend of the cardinal and the famous epicure whose grace after dinner used to be Good Lord do me the favor to cause me to digest what I have eaten	335.3492297343116
Nevertheless he died of indigestion in spite of his grace said DArtagnan	136.12357532362037
What can you expect replied Aramis in a tone of resignation	50.61046833770348
Every man that s born must fulfil his destiny	592.962583175801
If it be not an indelicate question resumed DArtagnan have you grown rich	3840.9461064243746
I make about twelve thousand francs a year without counting a little benefice of a thousand crowns the prince gave me	108.0048546372183
And how do you make your twelve thousand francs By your poems	299.56076359366745
No I have given up poetry except now and then to write a drinking song some gay sonnet or some innocent epigram I compose sermons my friend	1256.4036248565271
What sermons Do you preach them	118.9759209072035
No I sell them to those of my cloth who wish to become great orators	408.9311289259506
Ah indeed and you have not been tempted by the hopes of reputation yourself	113.70373017280737
I should my dear DArtagnan have been so but nature said No	355.2955245737823
When I am in the pulpit if by chance a pretty woman looks at me I look at her again if she smiles I smile too	283.17874728331134
Then I speak at random instead of preaching about the torments of hell I talk of the joys of Paradise	404.87238376087413
An event took place in the Church of St	120.91692279557667
A gentleman laughed in my face	118.94636713345899
I stopped short to tell him that he was a fool the congregation went out to get stones to stone me with but whilst they were away I found means to conciliate the priests who were present so that my foe was pelted instead of me	286.5932077943693
Tis true that he came the next morning to my house thinking that he had to do with an abblike all other abbs	142.36497088599856
And what was the end of the affair	9.70665876501671
We met in the Place RoyaleEgad you know about it	206.20711431453785
Was I not your second cried DArtagnan	1531.7399839958944
You were you know how I settled the matter	174.85007044306266
But at all events I gave him absolution in articulo mortis	4345.793631638012
Tis enough to kill the body without killing the soul	507.2155455121486
Bazin made a despairing sign which meant that while perhaps he approved the moral he altogether disapproved the tone in which it was uttered	256.17232476885704
Bazin my friend said Aramis you do nt seem to be aware that I can see you in that mirror and you forget that once for all I have forbidden all signs of approbation or disapprobation	102.76314619850265
You will do me the favor to bring us some Spanish wine and then to withdraw	114.68530012088736
Besides my friend DArtagnan has something to say to me privately have you not DArtagnan	233.3620859416545
DArtagnan nodded his head and Bazin retired after placing on the table the Spanish wine	325.0583407897432
The two friends left alone remained silent face to face	145.73804650533359
Aramis seemed to await a comfortable digestion DArtagnan to be preparing his exordium	2374.4431303955657
Each of them when the other was not looking hazarded a sly glance	1081.306377147563
It was Aramis who broke the silence	47.68936815503656
What are you thinking of DArtagnan he began	737.6187500243445
I was thinking my dear old friend that when you were a musketeer you turned your thoughts incessantly to the church and now that you are an abb you are perpetually longing to be once more a musketeer	170.84934471789524
Tis true man as you know said Aramis is a strange animal made up of contradictions	216.28646482912964
Since I became an abb I dream of nothing but battles	743.9818786300668
That is apparent in your surroundings you have rapiers here of every form and to suit the most exacting taste	716.1100035586458
II fence as well as you did in the old timebetter still perhaps I do nothing else all day	180.80380767300653
With an excellent masteratarms that we have here	64.43094700329827
Yes here in this convent my dear fellow	38.44789976881147
There is everything in a Jesuit convent	8906.951569369616
Then you would have killed Monsieur de Marsillac if he had come alone to attack you instead of at the head of twenty men	121.05955233415806
Undoubtedly said Aramis and even at the head of his twenty men if I could have drawn without being recognized	86.00032467324503
God pardon me said DArtagnan to himself I believe he has become more Gascon than I am Then aloud Well my dear Aramis do you ask me why I came to seek you	93.30342109585402
No I have not asked you that said Aramis with his subtle manner but I have expected you to tell me	72.2169790883835
Well I sought you for the single purpose of offering you a chance to kill Monsieur de Marsillac whenever you please prince though he is	239.98014911378777
Hold on wait said Aramis that is an idea	36.18305948170015
Of which I invite you to take advantage my friend	40.66484229696966
Let us see with your thousand crowns from the abbey and the twelve thousand francs you make by selling sermons are you rich Answer frankly	388.81408686454375
I I am as poor as Job and were you to search my pockets and my boxes I do nt believe you would find a hundred pistoles	136.06583730434397
Peste a hundred pistoles said DArtagnan to himself he calls that being as poor as Job If I had them I should think myself as rich as Croesus	202.56734518703675
Well my friend I bring you the means of becoming rich powerful and free to do whatever you wish	121.805837323077
The shadow of a cloud passed over Aramiss face as quickly as that which in August passes over the field of grain but quick as it was it did not escape DArtagnans observation	273.6833138849864
Do you take any interest in politics	536.811577932952
A gleam of light shone in Aramiss eyes as brief as the shadow that had passed over his face but not so brief but that it was seen by DArtagnan	101.69116167707799
Then proposals from any quarter will be agreeable to you since for the moment you have no master but God	65.57109312383659
Have you my dear Aramis thought sometimes of those happy happy happy days of youth we passed laughing drinking and fighting each other for play	583.0391352072795
Certainly and more than once regretted them it was indeed a glorious time	186.8993398222821
Well those splendidly wild days may chance to come again I am commissioned to find out my companions and I began by you who were the very soul of our society	141.43294557537465
Aramis bowed rather with respect than pleasure at the compliment	353.8273323584988
To meddle in politics he exclaimed in a languid voice leaning back in his easychair	147.3029151946809
Ah dear DArtagnan see how regularly I live and how easy I am here	121.59247859942097
We have experienced the ingratitude of the great as you well know	71.01539909167664
Yet the great sometimes repent of their ingratitude	406.74985128048377
In that case it would be quite another thing	91.40981929457172
Come lets be merciful to every sinner Besides you are right in another respect which is in thinking that if we were to meddle in politics there could not be a better time than the present	150.1067750753698
How can you know that You who never interest yourself in politics	703.4836819279119
Ah without caring about them myself I live among those who are much occupied in them	109.13498630216536
Poet as I am I am intimate with Sarazin who is devoted to the Prince de Conti and with Monsieur de BoisRobert who since the death of Cardinal Richelieu is of all parties or any party so that political discussions have not altogether been uninteresting to me	226.78269696489238
I have no doubt of it said DArtagnan	75.9597875810845
Now my dear friend look upon all I tell you as merely the statement of a monkof a man who resembles an echorepeating simply what he hears	221.05391721258886
I understand that Mazarin is at this very moment extremely uneasy as to the state of affairs that his orders are not respected like those of our former bugbear the deceased cardinal whose portrait as you see hangs yonderfor whatever may be thought of him it must be allowed that Richelieu was great	233.2303443853497
I will not contradict you there said DArtagnan	168.9409666911883
My first impressions were favorable to the minister I said to myself that a minister is never loved but that with the genius this one was said to have he would eventually triumph over his enemies and would make himself feared which in my opinion is much more to be desired than to be loved	144.57583067010694
DArtagnan made a sign with his head which indicated that he entirely approved that doubtful maxim	424.2921432079924
This then continued Aramis was my first opinion but as I am very ignorant in matters of this kind and as the humility which I profess obliges me not to rest on my own judgment but to ask the opinion of others I have inquiredEhmy friend	172.30499336732424
I must confess that I was mistaken	56.033786690836465
Monsieur de Mazarin is not a man of genius as I thought he is a man of no originonce a servant of Cardinal Bentivoglio and he got on by intrigue	164.83187403460735
He is an upstart a man of no name who will only be the tool of a party in France	107.76360283316788
He will amass wealth he will injure the kings revenue and pay to himself the pensions which Richelieu paid to others	407.5761492362459
He is neither a gentleman in manner nor in feeling but a sort of buffoon a punchinello a pantaloon	894.9961261404484
Do you know him I do not	3.71267336293959
Hem said DArtagnan there is some truth in what you say	75.505129206064
Ah it fills me with pride to find that thanks to a common sort of penetration with which I am endowed I am approved by a man like you fresh from the court	112.77289299193353
But you speak of him not of his party his resources	311.9703279051798
It is truethe queen is for him	168.38124379327135
But he will never have the king	124.91462698806633
A child who will be of age in four years	196.34213657548176
Then he has neither the parliament nor the people with himthey represent the wealth of the country nor the nobles nor the princes who are the military power of France	208.44016255478445
He was forced to confess to himself that this reasoning was not only comprehensive but just	175.80577998078033
You see my poor friend that I am sometimes bereft of my ordinary thoughtfulness perhaps I am wrong in speaking thus to you who have evidently a leaning to Mazarin	288.27906193919034
I cried DArtagnan not in the least	14.1386071525566
Did I I was wrong then no I said what you saythere is a crisis at hand	366.0078811541218
Well lets fly the feather before the wind let us join with that side to which the wind will carry it and resume our adventurous life	193.36858217073097
We were once four valiant knightsfour hearts fondly united let us unite again not our hearts which have never been severed but our courage and our fortunes	553.5475055404863
Heres a good opportunity for getting something better than a diamond	269.0329254052648
You are right DArtagnan I held a similar project but as I had not nor ever shall have your fruitful vigorous imagination the idea was suggested to me	241.63586790421553
Every one nowadays wants auxiliaries propositions have been made to me and I confess to you frankly that the coadjutor has made me speak out	96.95909174943077
Monsieur de Gondy the cardinals enemy	6544.852708003087
No the kings friend said Aramis the kings friend you understand	290.3169626964741
Well it is a question of serving the king the gentlemans duty	756.4757324720666
But the king is with Mazarin	15796.586214562842
He is but not willingly in appearance not heart and that is exactly the snare the kings enemies are preparing for the poor child	216.63776417565023
Ah but this is indeed civil war which you propose to me dear Aramis	192.10997451816812
Yet the king will be at the head of the army on Mazarins side	82.984251788759
But his heart will be in the army commanded by the Duc de Beaufort	65.14877917048294
Monsieur de Beaufort He is at Vincennes	2947.6761474547666
Did I say Monsieur de Beaufort Monsieur de Beaufort or another	270.09853741372694
Monsieur de Beaufort or Monsieur le Prince	541.9110540355897
But Monsieur le Prince is to set out for the army he is entirely devoted to the cardinal	77.74265536082807
Oh oh said Aramis there are questions between them at this very moment	45.052635033279024
And besides if it is not the prince then Monsieur de Gondy	174.1319187444062
But Monsieur de Gondy is to be made a cardinal they are soliciting the hat for him	224.80765175435127
And are there no cardinals that can fight Come now recall the four cardinals that at the head of armies have equalled Monsieur de Guebriant and Monsieur de Gassion	414.12957999959923
Under the cuirass the hump will not be seen	35.65816935622164
Besides remember that Alexander was lame and Hannibal had but one eye	427.3581989063921
Do you see any great advantage in adhering to this party asked DArtagnan	471.7587377006218
I foresee in it the aid of powerful princes	757.7092887247766
With the enmity of the government	1171.6109131573344
That may be done if they can separate the king from his mother	82.02396895998018
That may be done said Aramis	2490.2216718744644
You Aramis know Anne of Austria better than I do	40.04886510162659
Do you think she will ever forget that her son is her safeguard her shield the pledge for her dignity for her fortune and her life Should she forsake Mazarin she must join her son and go over to the princes side but you know better than I do that there are certain reasons why she can never abandon Mazarin	229.2924892584978
Perhaps you are right said Aramis thoughtfully therefore I shall not pledge myself	292.4526998574836
To them or to us do you mean Aramis	312.81524369269806
I am a priest resumed Aramis	24881.30378071977
What have I to do with politics I am not obliged to read any breviary	126.33450160206428
I have a jolly little circle of witty abbs and pretty women everything goes on smoothly so certainly dear friend I shall not meddle in politics	773.7600452662489
Well listen my dear Aramis said DArtagnan your philosophy convinces me on my honor	143.50429045370188
I do nt know what devil of an insect stung me and made me ambitious	570.5047644436726
I have a post by which I live at the death of Monsieur de Trville who is old I may be a captain which is a very snug berth for a once penniless Gascon	195.6196238785719
Instead of running after adventures I shall accept an invitation from Porthos I shall go and shoot on his estate	218.34712529183776
Ten leagues of wood of marsh land and valleys he is lord of the hill and the plain and is now carrying on a suit for his feudal rights against the Bishop of Noyon	420.4060071628179
That s what I wanted to know	18.105693841875798
And he has taken his ancient name of Vallon	816.3708087867669
To which he adds that of Bracieux an estate which has been a barony by my troth	311.79107209020015
So that Porthos will be a baron	96.48167593571897
The Baroness Porthos will sound particularly charming	18781.13373027977
And the two friends began to laugh	27.268345615015093
So DArtagnan resumed you will not become a partisan of Mazarins	312.6086170332709
Nor you of the Prince de Cond	25.480125017625813
No let us belong to no party but remain friends let us be neither Cardinalists nor Frondists	897.5154226066225
And DArtagnan poured out a glass of wine	5.434710340997431
Nonsense They will return said DArtagnan	3340.82048570413
At all events if you want me remember the Rue Tiquetonne Hotel de la Chevrette	109.34445342836257
And I shall be at the convent of Jesuits from six in the morning to eight at night come by the door	126.64573200530513
From eight in the evening until six in the morning come in by the window	143.16159096390297
Oh I ca nt let you go so I will go with you	15.18889304303666
And he took his sword and cloak	180.33108737834112
He wants to be sure that I go away said DArtagnan to himself	74.28560619705648
Aramis whistled for Bazin but Bazin was asleep in the antechamber and Aramis was obliged to shake him by the ear to awake him	97.85555827797394
Bazin stretched his arms rubbed his eyes and tried to go to sleep again	27.528722912956887
Come come sleepy head quick the ladder	501.21280111429115
But said Bazin yawning portentously the ladder is still at the window	100.97650516532819
Did nt you see that Monsieur dArtagnan mounted with difficulty It will be even more difficult to descend	228.5600802801068
DArtagnan was about to assure Aramis that he could descend easily when an idea came into his head which silenced him	181.4261945822997
Bazin uttered a profound sigh and went out to look for the ladder	63.47774540326737
Presently a good solid wooden ladder was placed against the window	46.11976443794856
Now then said DArtagnan this is something like this is a means of communication	65.43094675351537
A woman could go up a ladder like that	133.88249649933525
Aramiss searching look seemed to seek his friends thought even at the bottom of his heart but DArtagnan sustained the inquisition with an air of admirable simplicity	143.61708490233923
Besides at that moment he put his foot on the first step of the ladder and began his descent	45.907898306594056
In a moment he was on the ground	16.533030655321216
Stay there said Aramis I shall return immediately	90.54273446475477
The two friends went toward the shed	279.45174674112474
At their approach Planchet came out leading the two horses	78.69846235465867
That is good to see said Aramis	241.9503011583363
There is a servant active and vigilant not like that lazy fellow Bazin who is no longer good for anything since he became connected with the church	258.4786280742931
Follow us Planchet we shall continue our conversation to the end of the village	35.0924673496688
They traversed the width of the village talking of indifferent things then as they reached the last houses	215.09712479916283
Go then dear friend said Aramis follow your own career	443.04769388255255
Fortune lavishes her smiles upon you do not let her flee from your embrace	146.41511332192027
As for me I remain in my humility and indolence	474.1107050125595
Thus tis quite decided said DArtagnan that what I have to offer to you does not tempt you	90.28747995627998
On the contrary it would tempt me were I any other man rejoined Aramis but I repeat I am made up of contradictions	405.0227525304932
What I hate today I adore tomorrow and vice versa	5905.781087550704
You see that I can not like you for instance settle on any fixed plan	296.0838604178971
Thou liest subtile one said DArtagnan to himself	127.57270746343708
Thou alone on the contrary knowest how to choose thy object and to gain it stealthily	1255.904728153073
They descended into the plain by the ladder	183.5716326170223
Planchet met them hard by the shed	176.9020795117315
DArtagnan jumped into the saddle then the old companions in arms again shook hands	411.9616832499482
DArtagnan and Planchet spurred their steeds and took the road to Paris	39.73613999145065
But after he had gone about two hundred steps DArtagnan stopped short alighted threw the bridle of his horse over the arm of Planchet and took the pistols from his saddlebow to fasten them to his girdle	141.4973157430107
What s the matter asked Planchet	20362.13841014826
This is the matter be he ever so cunning he shall never say I was his dupe	489.457174033545
Stand here do nt stir turn your back to the road and wait for me	89.7437018431297
Having thus spoken DArtagnan cleared the ditch by the roadside and crossed the plain so as to wind around the village	219.431520854353
He had observed between the house that Madame de Longueville inhabited and the convent of the Jesuits an open space surrounded by a hedge	164.25000337308688
The moon had now risen and he could see well enough to retrace his road	133.16269679739082
He reached the hedge and hid himself behind it in passing by the house where the scene which we have related took place he remarked that the window was again lighted up and he was convinced that Aramis had not yet returned to his own apartment and that when he did it would not be alone	59.05574397193407
In truth in a few minutes he heard steps approaching and low whispers	340.7104483193363
Close to the hedge the steps stopped	790.6062562199078
DArtagnan knelt down near the thickest part of the hedge	268.3428016098868
Two men to the astonishment of DArtagnan appeared shortly soon however his surprise vanished for he heard the murmurs of a soft harmonious voice one of these two men was a woman disguised as a cavalier	239.98326863696542
Calm yourself dear Rene said the soft voice the same thing will never happen again	146.05119619676626
I have discovered a sort of subterranean passage which runs beneath the street and we shall only have to raise one of the marble slabs before the door to open you an entrance and an outlet	154.8043021784745
Oh answered another voice which DArtagnan instantly recognized as that of Aramis	633.1330974701361
I swear to you princess that if your reputation did not depend on precautions and if my life alone were jeopardized	194.59945221409697
Yes yes I know you are as brave and venturesome as any man in the world but you do not belong to me alone you belong to all our party	62.21477708674984
I always obey madame when I am commanded by so gentle a voice	112.43919997845094
Ah exclaimed the cavalier with a soft voice	102.387104794084
What s the matter asked Aramis	4873.713643988487
Do you not see that the wind has blown off my hat	144.89119896396662
Aramis rushed after the fugitive hat	651.4286917991002
DArtagnan took advantage of the circumstance to find a place in the hedge not so thick where his glance could penetrate to the supposed cavalier	288.5570268378744
At that instant the moon inquisitive perhaps like DArtagnan came from behind a cloud and by her light DArtagnan recognized the large blue eyes the golden hair and the classic head of the Duchess de Longueville	189.48208173963528
Aramis returned laughing one hat on his head and the other in his hand and he and his companion resumed their walk toward the convent	59.915770048414316
Good said DArtagnan rising and brushing his knees now I have theethou art a Frondeur and the lover of Madame de Longueville	200.6800049253856
Monsieur Porthos du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierrefonds	105.92736061663165
Thanks to what Aramis had told him DArtagnan who knew already that Porthos called himself Du Vallon was now aware that he styled himself from his estate De Bracieux and that he was on account of this estate engaged in a lawsuit with the Bishop of Noyon	190.36206463839028
It was then in the neighborhood of Noyon that he must seek that estate	384.4307961952158
His itinerary was promptly determined he would go to Dammartin from which place two roads diverge one toward Soissons the other toward Compiegne there he would inquire concerning the Bracieux estate and go to the right or to the left according to the information obtained	436.11535061324645
Planchet who was still a little concerned for his safety after his recent escapade declared that he would follow DArtagnan even to the end of the world either by the road to the right or by that to the left only he begged his former master to set out in the evening for greater security to himself	122.7049355786366
DArtagnan suggested that he should send word to his wife so that she might not be anxious about him but Planchet replied with much sagacity that he was very sure his wife would not die of anxiety through not knowing where he was while he Planchet remembering her incontinence of tongue would die of anxiety if she did know	170.85764819126584
This reasoning seemed to DArtagnan so satisfactory that he no further insisted and about eight oclock in the evening the time when the vapors of night begin to thicken in the streets he left the Hotel de la Chevrette and followed by Planchet set forth from the capital by way of the Saint Denis gate	137.28463624254147
At midnight the two travelers were at Dammartin but it was then too late to make inquiriesthe host of the Cygne de la Croix had gone to bed	150.39425913468324
The next morning DArtagnan summoned the host one of those sly Normans who say neither yes nor no and fear to commit themselves by giving a direct answer	259.87214639441225
DArtagnan however gathered from his equivocal replies that the road to the right was the one he ought to take and on that uncertain information he resumed his journey	221.83097524526673
At nine in the morning he reached Nanteuil and stopped for breakfast	272.4341433646035
His host here was a good fellow from Picardy who gave him all the information he needed	145.07904319054856
The Bracieux estate was a few leagues from VillarsCotterets	670.3864136021854
DArtagnan was acquainted with VillarsCotterets having gone thither with the court on several occasions for at that time VillarsCotterets was a royal residence	298.5979869075681
He therefore shaped his course toward that place and dismounted at the Dauphin dOr	920.4909939527985
There he ascertained that the Bracieux estate was four leagues distant but that Porthos was not at Bracieux	594.9869540441513
Porthos had in fact been involved in a dispute with the Bishop of Noyon in regard to the Pierrefonds property which adjoined his own and weary at length of a legal controversy which was beyond his comprehension he put an end to it by purchasing Pierrefonds and added that name to his others	293.93569146556206
He now called himself Du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierrefonds and resided on his new estate	136.09164184326505
The travelers were therefore obliged to stay at the hotel until the next day the horses had done ten leagues that day and needed rest	75.35535050540275
It is true they might have taken others but there was a great forest to pass through and Planchet as we have seen had no liking for forests after dark	167.51210660118423
There was another thing that Planchet had no liking for and that was starting on a journey with a hungry stomach	265.99210270264234
Accordingly DArtagnan on awaking found his breakfast waiting for him	145.31710912380512
It need not be said that Planchet in resuming his former functions resumed also his former humility and was not ashamed to make his breakfast on what was left by DArtagnan	386.00635166961604
It was nearly eight oclock when they set out again	58.63192170960502
Their course was clearly defined they were to follow the road toward Compiegne and on emerging from the forest turn to the right	155.4801819352002
The morning was beautiful and in this early springtime the birds sang on the trees and the sunbeams shone through the misty glades like curtains of golden gauze	430.28338153349733
In other parts of the forest the light could scarcely penetrate through the foliage and the stems of two old oak trees the refuge of the squirrel startled by the travelers were in deep shadow	179.1275916868923
There came up from all nature in the dawn of day a perfume of herbs flowers and leaves which delighted the heart	265.60644581123677
DArtagnan sick of the closeness of Paris thought that when a man had three names of his different estates joined one to another he ought to be very happy in such a paradise then he shook his head saying If I were Porthos and DArtagnan came to make me such a proposition as I am going to make to him I know what I should say to it	94.67502510106776
As to Planchet he thought of little or nothing but was happy as a huntinghound in his old masters company	370.20168087200364
At the extremity of the wood DArtagnan perceived the road that had been described to him and at the end of the road he saw the towers of an immense feudal castle	92.24024455347585
Oh oh he said I fancied this castle belonged to the ancient branch of Orleans	455.2537961779614
Can Porthos have negotiated for it with the Duc de Longueville	43.63988461607762
Faith exclaimed Planchet heres land in good condition if it belongs to Monsieur Porthos I wish him joy	262.14240211488055
Zounds cried DArtagnan do nt call him Porthos nor even Vallon call him De Bracieux or De Pierrefonds thou wilt knell out damnation to my mission otherwise	1244.7264893504855
As he approached the castle which had first attracted his eye DArtagnan was convinced that it could not be there that his friend dwelt the towers though solid and as if built yesterday were open and broken	260.9372154348013
One might have fancied that some giant had cleaved them with blows from a hatchet	661.8849335210697
On arriving at the extremity of the castle DArtagnan found himself overlooking a beautiful valley in which at the foot of a charming little lake stood several scattered houses which humble in their aspect and covered some with tiles others with thatch seemed to acknowledge as their sovereign lord a pretty chateau built about the beginning of the reign of Henry IV	349.41572195189764
and surmounted by four stately gilded weathercocks	17229.919156335534
DArtagnan no longer doubted that this was Porthoss pleasant dwelling place	2046.1817587184532
The road led straight up to the chateau which compared to its ancestor on the hill was exactly what a fop of the coterie of the Duc dEnghein would have been beside a knight in steel armor in the time of Charles VII	313.60514549494155
DArtagnan spurred his horse on and pursued his road followed by Planchet at the same pace	197.65021385225532
In ten minutes DArtagnan reached the end of an alley regularly planted with fine poplars and terminating in an iron gate the points and crossed bars of which were gilt	280.2988676715364
In the midst of this avenue was a nobleman dressed in green and with as much gilding about him as the iron gate riding on a tall horse	266.0661180714677
On his right hand and his left were two footmen with the seams of their dresses laced	380.1650648232558
A considerable number of clowns were assembled and rendered homage to their lord	415.7974545913278
Ah said DArtagnan to himself can this be the Seigneur du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierrefonds Welladay how he has shrunk since he gave up the name of Porthos	252.61460998646464
This can not be Monsieur Porthos observed Planchet replying as it were to his masters thoughts	589.3452743446276
Monsieur Porthos was six feet high this man is scarcely five	215.56744911103476
Nevertheless said DArtagnan the people are bowing very low to this person	177.5337922373952
As he spoke he rode toward the tall horseto the man of importance and his valets	303.6111870570487
As he approached he seemed to recognize the features of this individual	64.96375701263443
Jesu cried Planchet can it be	16.836000292932443
At this exclamation the man on horseback turned slowly and with a lofty air and the two travelers could see displayed in all their brilliancy the large eyes the vermilion visage and the eloquent smile ofMousqueton	377.2428883475468
It was indeed MousquetonMousqueton as fat as a pig rolling about with rude health puffed out with good living who recognizing DArtagnan and acting very differently from the hypocrite Bazin slipped off his horse and approached the officer with his hat off so that the homage of the assembled crowd was turned toward this new sun which eclipsed the former luminary	381.3230431751839
Monsieur dArtagnan Monsieur dArtagnan cried Mousqueton his fat cheeks swelling out and his whole frame perspiring with joy Monsieur dArtagnan oh what joy for my lord and master Du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierrefonds	368.63068773144545
Thou good Mousqueton where is thy master	1477.4297846661452
But how handsome thou arthow fat thou hast prospered and grown stout and DArtagnan could not restrain his astonishment at the change good fortune had produced on the once famished one	449.0800890219513
Hey yes thank God I am pretty well said Mousqueton	158.8265011868607
But hast thou nothing to say to thy friend Planchet	311.16161302781927
How my friend Planchet Planchetart thou there cried Mousqueton with open arms and eyes full of tears	141.1643958952085
My very self replied Planchet but I wanted first to see if thou wert grown proud	554.685089028227
Proud toward an old friend never Planchet thou wouldst not have thought so hadst thou known Mousqueton well	1273.661889682702
So far so well answered Planchet alighting and extending his arms to Mousqueton the two servants embraced with an emotion which touched those who were present and made them suppose that Planchet was a great lord in disguise so highly did they estimate the position of Mousqueton	259.1242175858258
And now sir resumed Mousqueton when he had rid himself of Planchet who had in vain tried to clasp his hands behind his friends fat back now sir allow me to leave you for I could not permit my master to hear of your arrival from any but myself he would never forgive me for not having preceded you	100.74199633700707
This dear friend said DArtagnan carefully avoiding to utter either the former name borne by Porthos or his new one then he has not forgotten me	307.9990340346798
Forgottenhe cried Mousqueton there s not a day sir that we do nt expect to hear that you were made marshal either instead of Monsieur de Gassion or of Monsieur de Bassompierre	159.18503306585018
On DArtagnans lips there played one of those rare and melancholy smiles which seemed to emanate from the depth of his soulthe last trace of youth and happiness that had survived lifes disillusions	244.16731773182573
And youfellows resumed Mousqueton stay near Monsieur le Comte dArtagnan and pay him every attention in your power whilst I go to prepare my lord for his visit	206.453689712541
And mounting his horse Mousqueton rode off down the avenue on the grass at a hand gallop	210.0771696286971
Ah there there s something promising said DArtagnan	429.45338076501656
No mysteries no cloak to hide ones self in no cunning policy here people laugh outright they weep for joy here	1738.6852126536342
I see nothing but faces a yard broad in short it seems to me that nature herself wears a holiday garb and that the trees instead of leaves and flowers are covered with red and green ribbons as on gala days	388.4258672477846
As for me said Planchet I seem to smell from this place even a most delectable perfume of fine roast meat and to see the scullions in a row by the hedge hailing our approach	442.07053675564885
Ah sir what a cook must Monsieur Pierrefonds have when he was so fond of eating and drinking even whilst he was only called Monsieur Porthos	379.80937578473515
If the reality corresponds with appearances I am lost for a man so well off will never change his happy condition and I shall fail with him as I have already done with Aramis	181.57514652302828
Wealth does not necessarily produce Happiness	58878.74032233932
DArtagnan passed through the iron gate and arrived in front of the chateau	35.64936600458894
He alighted as he saw a species of giant on the steps	266.182204415917
Let us do justice to DArtagnan	218696.81156042166
Independently of every selfish wish his heart palpitated with joy when he saw that tall form and martial demeanor which recalled to him a good and brave man	176.61493057828167
He ran to Porthos and threw himself into his arms the whole body of servants arranged in a semicircle at a respectful distance looked on with humble curiosity	119.6183256802337
Mousqueton at the head of them wiped his eyes	492.12587234250446
Porthos linked his arm in that of his friend	42.46750700893793
Ah how delightful to see you again dear friend he cried in a voice which was now changed from a baritone into a bass you ve not then forgotten me	113.9505774166751
Forget you oh dear Du Vallon does one forget the happiest days of flowery youth ones dearest friends the dangers we have dared together On the contrary there is not an hour we have passed together that is not present to my memory	202.47731805210336
Yes yes said Porthos trying to give to his mustache a curl which it had lost whilst he had been alone	118.7381409119593
Yes we did some fine things in our time and we gave that poor cardinal a few threads to unravel	365.1152941173652
Under any circumstances he resumed you are welcome my dear friend you will help me to recover my spirits tomorrow we will hunt the hare on my plain which is a superb tract of land or pursue the deer in my woods which are magnificent	167.93990840267668
I have four harriers which are considered the swiftest in the county and a pack of hounds which are unequalled for twenty leagues around	382.29501945523504
But first interposed DArtagnan you must present me to Madame du Vallon	87.70132736961042
I lost Madame du Vallon two years ago he said and you find me still in affliction on that account	74.01713795843216
That was the reason why I left my Chateau du Vallon near Corbeil and came to my estate Bracieux	444.46525378103956
Poor Madame du Vallon her temper was uncertain but she came at last to accustom herself to my little ways and understand my little wishes	268.3268296002784
So you are free now and rich	624.0283814152183
Alas groaned Porthos I am a widower and have forty thousand francs a year	47.29190598067278
I shall be happy to do so the morning air has made me hungry	111.66689810089167
Yes said Porthos my air is excellent	57.677761215917265
They went into the chateau there was nothing but gilding high and low the cornices were gilt the mouldings were gilt the legs and arms of the chairs were gilt	298.38254872114527
A table ready set out awaited them	324.23927387792446
You see said Porthos this is my usual style	159.0585398379243
Devil take me answered DArtagnan I wish you joy of it	69.29927152256049
The king has nothing like it	68.80280841257445
No answered Porthos I hear it said that he is very badly fed by the cardinal Monsieur de Mazarin	198.09404211250066
Taste this cutlet my dear DArtagnan tis off one of my sheep	540.5683123947445
You have very tender mutton and I wish you joy of it	55.63666964280859
Yes the sheep are fed in my meadows which are excellent pasture	664.960183213267
No try this hare which I had killed yesterday in one of my warrens	145.6502083404075
Zounds what a flavor cried DArtagnan ah they are fed on thyme only your hares	940.1074810247279
And how do you like my wine asked Porthos it is pleasant is nt it	213.85112933017967
It is nothing however but a wine of the country	93.98760334352534
Yes a small declivity to the south yonder on my hill gives me twenty hogsheads	1125.9200504351475
Porthos sighed for the fifth timeDArtagnan had counted his sighs	2185.892876272762
He became curious to solve the problem	350.82935770873615
Well now he said it seems my dear friend that something vexes you you are ill perhaps That health which	330.27159975229984
Excellent my dear friend better than ever	24.285174614180523
I could kill an ox with a blow of my fist	10.203934508776097
Family I have happily only myself in the world to care for	71.54304391733402
My dear fellow replied Porthos to be candid with you I am not happy	46.42178220291055
You are not happy Porthos You who have chateau meadows mountains woodsyou who have forty thousand francs a yearyouarenothappy	982.4744059969993
My dear friend all those things I have but I am a hermit in the midst of superfluity	73.34091923254982
Surrounded I suppose only by clodhoppers with whom you could not associate	552.163606681235
Porthos turned rather pale and drank off a large glass of wine	36.66188474251459
No but just think there are paltry country squires who have all some title or another and pretend to go back as far as Charlemagne or at least to Hugh Capet	489.56946274685504
When I first came here being the last comer it was for me to make the first advances	178.80645338726904
I made them but you know my dear friend Madame du Vallon	68.92299191353192
Porthos in pronouncing these words seemed to gulp down something	489.02314777857424
Madame du Vallon was of doubtful gentility	59967.259201910645
She had in her first marriageI do nt think DArtagnan I am telling you anything newmarried a lawyer they thought that nauseous you can understand that s a word bad enough to make one kill thirty thousand men	337.1231305027931
I have killed two which has made people hold their tongues but has not made me their friend	237.2065347926171
So that I have no society I live alone I am sick of itmy mind preys on itself	513.3017471951407
He now saw where the breastplate was weak and prepared the blow	274.3866922673739
But now he said that you are a widower your wifes connection can not injure you	294.0544489777053
Yes but understand me not being of a race of historic fame like the De Courcys who were content to be plain sirs or the Rohans who did nt wish to be dukes all these people who are all either vicomtes or comtes go before me at church in all the ceremonies and I can say nothing to them	271.97283633746355
Ah If I only were a	201.2724306246117
A baron do nt you mean cried DArtagnan finishing his friends sentence	1231.1025793632202
Ah cried Porthos would I were but a baron	267.77358014642357
Well my friend I am come to give you this very title which you wish for so much	38.908203230319195
Porthos gave a start that shook the room two or three bottles fell and were broken	176.07175868308636
Mousqueton ran thither hearing the noise	37.29554321319661
Porthos waved his hand to Mousqueton to pick up the bottles	347.9285757259338
I am glad to see said DArtagnan that you have still that honest lad with you	237.92712381089564
He is my steward replied Porthos he will never leave me	84.52096575294966
So he s called Mouston thought DArtagnan tis too long a word to pronounce Mousqueton	594.4597684282562
Well he said aloud let us resume our conversation later your people may suspect something there may be spies about	376.3445847128649
You can suppose Porthos that what I have to say relates to most important matters	270.65394075107434
Devil take them let us walk in the park answered Porthos for the sake of digestion	228.49623230517196
Egad said DArtagnan the park is like everything else and there are as many fish in your pond as rabbits in your warren you are a happy man my friend since you have not only retained your love of the chase but acquired that of fishing	163.01779225835745
My friend replied Porthos I leave fishing to Mousquetonit is a vulgar pleasurebut I shoot sometimes that is to say when I am dull and I sit on one of those marble seats have my gun brought to me my favorite dog and I shoot rabbits	353.8634764848302
Yes replied Porthos with a sigh it is amusing	55.869600283791506
DArtagnan now no longer counted the sighs	960.1707054636448
However what had you to say to me he resumed let us return to that subject	77.3091146617197
With pleasure replied DArtagnan I must however first frankly tell you that you must change your mode of life	174.51584210597932
Go into harness again gird on your sword run after adventures and leave as in old times a little of your fat on the roadside	465.7110320335567
I see you are spoiled dear friend you are corpulent your arm has no longer that movement of which the late cardinals guards have so many proofs	225.2018296739501
Ah my fist is strong enough I swear cried Porthos extending a hand like a shoulder of mutton	182.11164032826596
Are we then to go to war	1226.1987176885057
Are you for Mazarin or for the princes	368.74990843323997
That is to say you are for us	39.87781928338914
Well I tell you that I come to you from the cardinal	44.864654372654684
This speech was heard by Porthos in the same sense as if it had still been in the year 1640 and related to the true cardinal	140.12830462891313
Ho ho What are the wishes of his eminence	178.37728357785394
He wishes to have you in his service	86.32268033569265
And who spoke to him of me	89.9248930368098
Yes pardieu It was he who gave us so much trouble and kept us on the road so much you gave him three swordwounds in three separate engagements	209.47863520027488
But you know he is now our friend	81.10217929884635
No I did nt know that	13.060628556416914
You are mistaken Porthos said DArtagnan	2155.091816270176
It is I who cherish no resentment	1777.4998640162153
Porthos did nt understand any too clearly but then we know that understanding was not his strong point	310.57477841267894
You say then he continued that the Count de Rochefort spoke of me to the cardinal	92.64758161625237
To inspire us with confidence she has even placed in Mazarins hands that famous diamondyou remember all about itthat I once sold to Monsieur des Essarts and of which I do nt know how she has regained possession	282.30883834009137
But it seems to me said Porthos that she would have done much better if she had given it back to you	67.08450075413536
So I think replied DArtagnan but kings and queens are strange beings and have odd fancies nevertheless since they are the ones who have riches and honors we are devoted to them	231.1175239513385
Yes we are devoted to them repeated Porthos and youto whom are you devoted now	530.8487791951289
To the king the queen and to the cardinal moreover I have answered for your devotion also	158.06880168254744
And you say that you have made certain conditions on my behalf	231.72062051939284
Magnificent my dear fellow magnificent In the first place you have plenty of money have nt you forty thousand francs income I think you said	90.01969306588826
Eh my friend said he one never has too much money	321.73271996653216
Madame du Vallon left things in much disorder I am not much of a hand at figures so that I live almost from hand to mouth	288.80838993442336
He is afraid I have come to borrow money thought DArtagnan	1134.019453659569
Ah my friend said he it is all the better if you are in difficulties	61.792298477413624
How is it all the better	80.89227906501485
Yes for his eminence will give you all that you wantland money and titles	250.71594101741357
Ah ah ah said Porthos opening his eyes at that last word	111.43730719105359
Under the other cardinal continued DArtagnan we did nt know enough to make our profits this however does nt concern you with your forty thousand francs income the happiest man in the world it seems to me	144.17247889856196
At the same time continued DArtagnan notwithstanding your forty thousand francs a year and perhaps even for the very reason that you have forty thousand francs a year it seems to me that a little coronet would do well on your carriage hey	106.90040711894197
Well my dear friend win itit is at the point of your sword	135.2636040399181
We shall not interfere with each otheryour object is a title mine money	1180.2037472311276
If I can get enough to rebuild Artagnan which my ancestors impoverished by the Crusades allowed to fall into ruins and to buy thirty acres of land about it that is all I wish	383.0192033449945
I shall retire and die tranquillyat home	56544.885277530935
For my part said Porthos I desire to be made a baron	49.10340051924665
And have you not seen any of our other friends	159.59029923426394
And what does he wish To be a bishop	1684.3471102073495
Aramis answered DArtagnan who did not wish to undeceive Porthos Aramis fancy has become a monk and a Jesuit and lives like a bear	497.2732322154163
My offers did not arouse himdid not even tempt him	1124.097891020526
So much the worse He was a clever man	41.11011525623384
I have not yet seen him	8.736928258410975
Do you know where I shall find him	22.039690974676386
Athos who was of as high birth as the emperor and who inherits one estate which gives him the title of comte what is he to do with all those dignitiesthe Comte de la Fere Comte de Bragelonne	127.81192138312196
And he has no children with all these titles	84.3899474881419
Ah said Porthos I have heard that he had adopted a young man who resembles him greatly	69.58544656786292
What Athos Our Athos who was as virtuous as Scipio Have you seen him	285.00304596560244
Well I shall see him tomorrow and tell him about you but I m afraid entre nous that his liking for wine has aged and degraded him	611.9668533112776
Yes he used to drink a great deal replied Porthos	223.76835584082127
And then he was older than any of us added DArtagnan	171.4895256980621
His gravity made him look older than he was	270.45201153353355
Well then if we can get Athos all will be well	212.44247123047495
If we can not we will do without him	48.70996064704292
We two are worth a dozen	1746.6643485298066
Yes said Porthos smiling at the remembrance of his former exploits but we four altogether would be equal to thirtysix more especially as you say the work will not be childs play	232.9293723782113
Byr Lady two or three years perhaps	49.94794172270962
So much the better cried Porthos	4694.448384616738
You have no idea my friend how my bones ache since I came here	391.16379427801724
Sometimes on a Sunday I take a ride in the fields and on the property of my neighbours in order to pick up a nice little quarrel which I am really in want of but nothing happens	160.1515476191163
Either they respect or they fear me which is more likely but they let me trample down the clover with my dogs insult and obstruct every one and I come back still more weary and lowspirited that s all	344.7343683962583
At any rate tell me there s more chance of fighting in Paris is there not	188.11973436266058
In that respect my dear friend its delightful	1611.002611087113
No more edicts no more of the cardinals guards no more De Jussacs nor other bloodhounds	988.2307718301563
IGad underneath a lamp in an inn anywhere they ask Are you one of the Fronde They unsheathe and that s all that is said	249.63637604239028
The Duke de Guise killed Monsieur de Coligny in the Place Royale and nothing was said of it	87.76470240199046
Ah things go on gaily then said Porthos	108.48829954798298
Besides which in a short time resumed DArtagnan We shall have set battles cannonades conflagrations and there will be great variety	972.244619588522
I shall fight heart and soul for Mazarin but	839.9200476612658
But he must make me a baron	78.88210321062978
Zounds said DArtagnan that s settled already I will be responsible for the barony	204.72156224594494
On this promise being given Porthos who had never doubted his friends assurance turned back with him toward the castle	299.47094782484635
Porthos was Discontented with his Condition	78442.53318944629
As they returned toward the castle DArtagnan thought of the miseries of poor human nature always dissatisfied with what it has ever desirous of what it has not	255.7902821629976
In the position of Porthos DArtagnan would have been perfectly happy and to make Porthos contented there was wantingwhat five letters to put before his three names a tiny coronet to paint upon the panels of his carriage	338.06469173203266
I shall pass all my life thought DArtagnan in seeking for a man who is really contented with his lot	159.0330974481565
Whilst making this reflection chance seemed as it were to give him the lie direct	166.6748689112774
When Porthos had left him to give some orders he saw Mousqueton approaching	210.71544687059233
The face of the steward despite one slight shade of care light as a summer cloud seemed a physiognomy of absolute felicity	825.0854595183526
Here is what I am looking for thought DArtagnan but alas the poor fellow does not know the purpose for which I am here	109.3373029100511
He then made a sign for Mousqueton to come to him	85.65664012494298
Sir said the servant I have a favour to ask you	98.33188600158539
I am afraid to do so	5.481866140229836
Perhaps you will think sir that prosperity has spoiled me	406.0935095718065
Art thou happy friend asked DArtagnan	5710.237131765746
As happy as possible and yet sir you may make me even happier than I am	98.24038310940202
Well speak if it depends on me	8.78790794528671
Oh sir it depends on you only	106.78791805700466
I listenI am waiting to hear	262.0463770227951
Sir the favor I have to ask of you is not to call me Mousqueton but Mouston	133.14418555656863
Since I have had the honor of being my lords steward I have taken the last name as more dignified and calculated to make my inferiors respect me	204.91150893383374
You sir know how necessary subordination is in any large establishment of servants	615.6528435364789
DArtagnan smiled Porthos wanted to lengthen out his names Mousqueton to cut his short	923.7332882105677
Well my dear Mouston he said rest satisfied	2711.646749020673
I will call thee Mouston and if it makes thee happy I will not tutoyer you any longer	173.28226626468108
Oh cried Mousqueton reddening with joy if you do me sir such honor I shall be grateful all my life it is too much to ask	41.391723637345706
Alas thought DArtagnan it is very little to offset the unexpected tribulations I am bringing to this poor devil who has so warmly welcomed me	193.80638661668112
Will monsieur remain long with us asked Mousqueton with a serene and glowing countenance	415.41452934005815
I go tomorrow my friend replied DArtagnan	1458.315496575323
Ah monsieur said Mousqueton then you have come here only to awaken our regrets	190.10316755146798
I fear that is true said DArtagnan in a low tone	16.130699654371238
DArtagnan was secretly touched with remorse not at inducing Porthos to enter into schemes in which his life and fortune would be in jeopardy for Porthos in the title of baron had his object and reward but poor Mousqueton whose only wish was to be called Moustonwas it not cruel to snatch him from the delightful state of peace and plenty in which he was	278.0646355129863
He was thinking of these matters when Porthos summoned him to dinner	647.6211669995855
Eh why it is after one oclock	115.1078639936128
Your home is a paradise Porthos one takes no note of time	660.8382614916176
I follow you though I am not hungry	35.0349014018683
Come if one ca nt always eat one can always drinka maxim of poor Athos the truth of which I have discovered since I began to be lonely	203.2361399111357
DArtagnan who as a Gascon was inclined to sobriety seemed not so sure as his friend of the truth of Athoss maxim but he did his best to keep up with his host	196.8961672699307
Meanwhile his misgivings in regard to Mousqueton recurred to his mind and with greater force because Mousqueton though he did not himself wait on the table which would have been beneath him in his new position appeared at the door from time to time and evinced his gratitude to DArtagnan by the quality of the wine he directed to be served	104.52684336441962
Therefore when at dessert upon a sign from DArtagnan Porthos had sent away his servants and the two friends were alone	97.14762540527569
Porthos said DArtagnan who will attend you in your campaigns	231.37917114854937
Why replied Porthos Mouston of course	3432.789723453989
This was a blow to DArtagnan	28746.75511399068
He could already see the intendants beaming smile change to a contortion of grief	2104.685241696077
But he said Mouston is not so young as he was my dear fellow besides he has grown fat and perhaps has lost his fitness for active service	252.98100041438735
That may be true replied Porthos but I am used to him and besides he would nt be willing to let me go without him he loves me so much	55.07205445624927
And you asked Porthos have nt you still in your service your old lackey that good that brave that intelligentwhat then is his name	312.85172572550977
Planchetyes I have found him again but he is lackey no longer	244.4221086095725
With his sixteen hundred francsyou remember the sixteen hundred francs he earned at the siege of La Rochelle by carrying a letter to Lord de Winterhe has set up a little shop in the Rue des Lombards and is now a confectioner	183.62736324797288
Ah he is a confectioner in the Rue des Lombards How does it happen then that he is in your service	72.46757452755318
He has been guilty of certain escapades and fears he may be disturbed	312.4071513625796
And the musketeer narrated to his friend Planchets adventure	1708.486330231084
Well said Porthos if any one had told you in the old times that the day would come when Planchet would rescue Rochefort and that you would protect him in it	196.21912521910014
I should not have believed him but men are changed by events	174.16928740966458
There is nothing truer than that said Porthos but what does not change or changes for the better is wine	197.77937609433144
Taste of this it is a Spanish wine which our friend Athos thought much of	422.2520023543564
At that moment the steward came in to consult his master upon the proceedings of the next day and also with regard to the shooting party which had been proposed	97.57743525326572
Tell me Mouston said Porthos are my arms in good condition	243.9240940211578
Yes my lord at any rate I think so	31.19562729132792
Make sure of it and if they want it have them burnished up	451.87471374957016
Which is my best cavalry horse	8081.382738062708
What horse dost thou choose for thyself	791.7153853780237
I like Rustaud my lord a good animal whose paces suit me	782.6573583655984
Half Norman half Mecklenburger will go night and day	719.5905452067108
Polish up or make some one else polish my arms	1082.4183911312552
Then take pistols with thee and a huntingknife	390.45230330446884
Are we then going to travel my lord asked Mousqueton rather uneasy	582.2101942656286
An expedition sir asked the steward whose roses began to change into lilies	886.5526927114418
We are going to return to the service Mouston replied Porthos still trying to restore his mustache to the military curl it had long lost	232.35683379021933
Into the servicethe kings service Mousqueton trembled even his fat smooth cheeks shook as he spoke and he looked at DArtagnan with an air of reproach he staggered and his voice was almost choked	155.1240031957666
We shall serve in a campaign seek out all sorts of adventuresreturn in short to our former life	615.5662504346251
These last words fell on Mousqueton like a thunderbolt	445.7476135684786
It was those very terrible old days that made the present so excessively delightful and the blow was so great he rushed out overcome and forgot to shut the door	195.71972884779683
The two friends remained alone to speak of the future and to build castles in the air	125.39853855097307
The good wine which Mousqueton had placed before them traced out in glowing drops to DArtagnan a fine perspective shining with quadruples and pistoles and showed to Porthos a blue ribbon and a ducal mantle they were in fact asleep on the table when the servants came to light them to their bed	284.0850587741451
Mousqueton was however somewhat consoled by DArtagnan who the next day told him that in all probability war would always be carried on in the heart of Paris and within reach of the Chateau du Vallon which was near Corbeil or Bracieux which was near Melun and of Pierrefonds which was between Compiegne and VillarsCotterets	160.22713125086787
Oh said DArtagnan we do nt now make war as we did formerly	313.0141584097961
Today its a sort of diplomatic arrangement ask Planchet	41337.36473977808
Mousqueton inquired therefore the state of the case of his old friend who confirmed the statement of DArtagnan	48.54214956438015
But he added in this war prisoners stand a chance of being hung	1147.4146256460579
The deuce they do said Mousqueton I think I should like the siege of Rochelle better than this war then	206.60902630228526
Porthos meantime asked DArtagnan to give him his instructions how to proceed on his journey	132.83223775296682
Four days replied his friend are necessary to reach Blois one day to rest there three or four days to return to Paris	126.11879975252936
Set out therefore in a week with your suite and go to the Hotel de la Chevrette Rue Tiquetonne and there await me	115.23448023743616
As to myself I shall go around to see Athos for though I do nt think his aid worth much one must with ones friends observe all due politeness said DArtagnan	381.2101896847847
The friends then took leave of each other on the very border of the estate of Pierrefonds to which Porthos escorted his friend	144.27052522779874
At least DArtagnan said to himself as he took the road to VillarsCotterets at least I shall not be alone in my undertaking	52.85771933939874
That devil Porthos is a man of prodigious strength still if Athos joins us well we shall be three of us to laugh at Aramis that little coxcomb with his too good luck	363.1969445322522
At VillarsCotterets he wrote to the cardinal	92.11262217329559
My LordI have already one man to offer to your eminence and he is well worth twenty men	88.61573149360196
I am just setting out for Blois	1682.464754279027
The Comte de la Fere inhabits the Castle of Bragelonne in the environs of that city	235.62675251408004
The road was long but the horses upon which DArtagnan and Planchet rode had been refreshed in the well supplied stables of the Lord of Bracieux the master and servant rode side by side conversing as they went for DArtagnan had by degrees thrown off the master and Planchet had entirely ceased to assume the manners of a servant	402.4609406833073
He had been raised by circumstances to the rank of a confidant to his master	49.6421339445373
It was many years since DArtagnan had opened his heart to any one it happened however that these two men on meeting again assimilated perfectly	343.02243514565504
Planchet was in truth no vulgar companion in these new adventures he was a man of uncommonly sound sense	370.2842974938432
Without courting danger he never shrank from an encounter in short he had been a soldier and arms ennoble a man it was therefore on the footing of friends that DArtagnan and Planchet arrived in the neighborhood of Blois	230.17480520621595
Going along DArtagnan shaking his head said	33.51376482399061
I know that my going to Athos is useless and absurd but still I owe this courtesy to my old friend a man who had in him material for the most noble and generous of characters	212.51051736939615
Oh Monsieur Athos was a noble gentleman said Planchet was he not Scattering money round about him as Heaven sprinkles rain	1368.880213579168
Do you remember sir that duel with the Englishman in the inclosure des Carmes Ah how lofty how magnificent Monsieur Athos was that day when he said to his adversary You have insisted on knowing my name sir so much the worse for you since I shall be obliged to kill you	183.15730425545036
I was near him those were his exact words when he stabbed his foe as he said he would and his adversary fell without saying Oh Tis a noble gentlemanMonsieur Athos	393.617475486719
Yes true as Gospel said DArtagnan but one single fault has swallowed up all these fine qualities	285.7458869259219
I remember well said Planchet he was fond of drinkingin truth he drank but not as other men drink	401.3699263863384
One seemed as he raised the wine to his lips to hear him say Come juice of the grape and chase away my sorrows	261.9452450811302
And how he used to break the stem of a glass or the neck of a bottle There was no one like him for that	87.4693640160509
And now replied DArtagnan behold the sad spectacle that awaits us	193.6500613812787
This noble gentleman with his lofty glance this handsome cavalier so brilliant in feats of arms that every one was surprised that he held in his hand a sword only instead of a baton of command Alas we shall find him changed into a broken down old man with garnet nose and eyes that slobber we shall find him extended on some lawn whence he will look at us with a languid eye and peradventure will not recognize us	221.00666725787298
God knows Planchet that I should fly from a sight so sad if I did not wish to show my respect for the illustrious shadow of what was once the Comte de la Fere whom we loved so much	71.59343872187293
Planchet shook his head and said nothing	164.7033151348875
It was evident that he shared his masters apprehensions	1337.7048824855867
And then resumed DArtagnan to this decrepitude is probably added poverty for he must have neglected the little that he had and the dirty scoundrel Grimaud more taciturn than ever and still more drunken than his masterstay Planchet it breaks my heart to merely think of it	515.7797401575747
I fancy myself there and that I see him staggering and hear him stammering said Planchet in a piteous tone but at all events we shall soon know the real state of things for I imagine that those lofty walls now turning ruby in the setting sun are the walls of Blois	258.1057034768271
Probably and those steeples pointed and sculptured that we catch a glimpse of yonder are similar to those that I have heard described at Chambord	394.5595424388372
At this moment one of those heavy wagons drawn by bullocks which carry the wood cut in the fine forests of the country to the ports of the Loire came out of a byroad full of ruts and turned on that which the two horsemen were following	212.56222161594957
A man carrying a long switch with a nail at the end of it with which he urged on his slow team was walking with the cart	141.3232708725303
What s your pleasure gentlemen replied the peasant with a purity of accent peculiar to the people of that district and which might have put to shame the cultured denizens of the Sorbonne and the Rue de lUniversite	150.39114706127003
We are looking for the house of Monsieur de la Fere said DArtagnan	76.3741507002117
The peasant took off his hat on hearing this revered name	323.632575385849
Gentlemen he said the wood that I am carting is his I cut it in his copse and I am taking it to the chateau	198.81273738128195
DArtagnan determined not to question this man he did not wish to hear from another what he had himself said to Planchet	84.5187486869711
The chateau he said to himself what chateau Ah I understand Athos is not a man to be thwarted he like Porthos has obliged his peasantry to call him my lord and to dignify his pettifogging place by the name of chateau	262.7334380794922
He had a heavy handdear old Athosafter drinking	28145.549628402205
DArtagnan after asking the man the right way continued his route agitated in spite of himself at the idea of seeing once more that singular man whom he had so truly loved and who had contributed so much by advice and example to his education as a gentleman	170.90333820901154
He checked by degrees the speed of his horse and went on his head drooping as if in deep thought	68.21649217109685
Soon as the road turned the Chateau de la Valliere appeared in view then a quarter of a mile beyond a white house encircled in sycamores was visible at the farther end of a group of trees which spring had powdered with a snow of flowers	129.75973792815802
On beholding this house DArtagnan calm as he was in general felt an unusual disturbance within his heartso powerful during the whole course of life are the recollections of youth	214.06944787029633
He proceeded nevertheless and came opposite to an iron gate ornamented in the taste of the period	141.96741960815814
Through the gate was seen kitchengardens carefully attended to a spacious courtyard in which neighed several horses held by valets in various liveries and a carriage drawn by two horses of the country	572.0152211282083
This can not be the establishment of Athos	1230.292178202956
Good heavens suppose he is dead and that this property now belongs to some one who bears his name	240.12446582624304
Alight Planchet and inquire for I confess that I have scarcely courage so to do	69.87088915953544
Thou must add said DArtagnan that a gentleman who is passing by wishes to have the honor of paying his respects to the Comte de la Fere and if thou art satisfied with what thou hearest then mention my name	83.49373639499869
Planchet leading his horse by the bridle drew near to the gate and rang the bell and immediately a servantman with white hair and of erect stature notwithstanding his age presented himself	118.74027127735901
Does Monsieur le Comte de la Fere live here asked Planchet	269.96925614763444
Yes monsieur it is here he lives the servant replied to Planchet who was not in livery	326.0165394645409
A nobleman retired from service is he not	44.51189333863429
And who had a lackey named Grimaud persisted Planchet who had prudently considered that he could nt have too much information	313.5581608183266
Monsieur Grimaud is absent from the chateau for the time being said the servitor who little used as he was to such inquiries began to examine Planchet from head to foot	231.5270207148693
Then cried Planchet joyously I see well that it is the same Comte de la Fere whom we seek	69.36995450271324
Be good enough to open to me for I wish to announce to monsieur le comte that my master one of his friends is here and wishes to greet him	96.41502378344863
Why did nt you say so said the servitor opening the gate	221.37848061063227
The servitor opened the gate and walked before Planchet who made a sign to DArtagnan	102.85383465926459
The latter his heart palpitating more than ever entered the courtyard without dismounting	204.57016769448552
Whilst Planchet was standing on the steps before the house he heard a voice say	45.93774132166685
Well where is this gentleman and why do they not bring him here	54.641126997310344
This voice the sound of which reached DArtagnan reawakened in his heart a thousand sentiments a thousand recollections that he had forgotten	261.9481085394257
He vaulted hastily from his horse whilst Planchet with a smile on his lips advanced toward the master of the house	59.04343985032624
But I know you my lad said Athos appearing on the threshold	201.66724721660063
Oh yes monsieur le comte you know me and I know you	13.939463745151308
I am PlanchetPlanchet whom you know well	65.08665263779673
But the honest servant could say no more so much was he overcome by this unexpected interview	109.23283159960371
What Planchet is Monsieur dArtagnan here	434.07254300861683
Here I am my friend dear Athos cried DArtagnan in a faltering voice and almost staggering from agitation	288.875680168512
At these words a visible emotion was expressed on the beautiful countenance and calm features of Athos	117.84759327805854
He rushed toward DArtagnan with eyes fixed upon him and clasped him in his arms	46.79641784721577
DArtagnan equally moved pressed him also closely to him whilst tears stood in his eyes	294.91971927915563
Athos then took him by the hand and led him into the drawingroom where there were several people	31.192572439674457
I present to you he said Monsieur le Chevalier DArtagnan lieutenant of his majestys musketeers a devoted friend and one of the most excellent brave gentlemen that I have ever known	224.13902858429145
DArtagnan received the compliments of those who were present in his own way and whilst the conversation became general he looked earnestly at Athos	133.17629936825583
Strange Athos was scarcely aged at all His fine eyes no longer surrounded by that dark line which nights of dissipation pencil too infallibly seemed larger more liquid than ever	646.9418489627712
His face a little elongated had gained in calm dignity what it had lost in feverish excitement	425.86074137713575
His hand always wonderfully beautiful and strong was set off by a ruffle of lace like certain hands by Titian and Vandyck	438.51966646996044
He was less stiff than formerly	6576.304854884026
His long dark hair softly powdered here and there with silver tendrils fell elegantly over his shoulders in wavy curls his voice was still youthful as if belonging to a Hercules of twentyfive and his magnificent teeth which he had preserved white and sound gave an indescribable charm to his smile	288.57043066890344
Meanwhile the guests seeing that the two friends were longing to be alone prepared to depart when a noise of dogs barking resounded through the courtyard and many persons said at the same moment	110.53821161111907
Ah tis Raoul who is come home	342.8439086096949
Athos as the name of Raoul was pronounced looked inquisitively at DArtagnan in order to see if any curiosity was painted on his face	216.45617747058972
But DArtagnan was still in confusion and turned around almost mechanically when a fine young man of fifteen years of age dressed simply but in perfect taste entered the room raising as he came his hat adorned with a long plume of scarlet feathers	185.11633240859706
Nevertheless DArtagnan was struck by the appearance of this new personage	46.3178799251877
It seemed to explain to him the change in Athos a resemblance between the boy and the man explained the mystery of this regenerated existence	349.248883278968
Here you are home again Raoul said the comte	416.56920503196284
Yes sir replied the youth with deep respect and I have performed the commission that you gave me	79.34304230263442
But what s the matter Raoul said Athos very anxiously	1960.8969109324598
Sir replied the young man it is on account of an accident which has happened to our little neighbor	73.31352291408487
To Mademoiselle de la Valliere asked Athos quickly	513.8702784181573
What is it cried many persons present	501.2540297730223
She was walking with her nurse Marceline in the place where the woodmen cut the wood when passing on horseback I stopped	409.05900791276605
She saw me also and in trying to jump from the end of a pile of wood on which she had mounted the poor child fell and was not able to rise again	74.30834040854847
I fear that she has badly sprained her ankle	31829.556661292463
And her mother Madame de SaintRemy have they yet told her of it	357.3562090239907
No sir Madame de SaintRemy is at Blois with the Duchess of Orleans	165.3038481779155
I am afraid that what was first done was unskillful if not worse than useless	1077.8859761005976
I am come sir to ask your advice	33.66771127890227
Send directly to Blois Raoul or rather take horse and ride immediately yourself	1038.7748300627247
But where is Louise asked the comte	525.0806297341857
I have brought her here sir and I have deposited her in charge of Charlotte who till better advice comes has bathed the foot in cold wellwater	419.18580345871476
The guests now all took leave of Athos excepting the old Duc de Barbe who as an old friend of the family of La Valliere went to see little Louise and offered to take her to Blois in his carriage	103.32156856339331
You are right sir said Athos	11488.327070159557
She will be the sooner with her mother	128.174691525156
As for you Raoul I am sure it is your fault some giddiness or folly	169.05440195468827
No sir I assure you muttered Raoul it is not	184.91836551083927
Oh no no I declare it is not cried the young girl while Raoul turned pale at the idea of his being perhaps the cause of her disaster	67.91075625149442
Nevertheless Raoul you must go to Blois and you must make your excuses and mine to Madame de SaintRemy	111.90776493976195
He again took in his strong arms the little girl whose pretty golden head and smiling face rested on his shoulder and placed her gently in the carriage then jumping on his horse with the elegance of a firstrate esquire after bowing to Athos and DArtagnan he went off close by the door of the carriage on somebody inside of which his eyes were riveted	143.799144189484
Whilst this scene was going on DArtagnan remained with open mouth and a confused gaze	360.5387728753898
Everything had turned out so differently from what he expected that he was stupefied with wonder	166.988294124624
Athos who had been observing him and guessing his thoughts took his arm and led him into the garden	43.018729602279585
Whilst supper is being prepared he said smiling you will not my friend be sorry to have the mystery which so puzzles you cleared up	183.4980803239129
True monsieur le comte replied DArtagnan who felt that by degrees Athos was resuming that great influence which aristocracy had over him	382.2958246046772
First and foremost dear DArtagnan we have no title such as count here	169.2496461450743
When I call you chevalier it is in presenting you to my guests that they may know who you are	72.82434855817962
But to you DArtagnan I am I hope still dear Athos your comrade your friend	280.79680590689384
Do you intend to stand on ceremony because you are less attached to me than you were	105.85637457570512
Then let us be as we used to be let us be open with each other	67.37994229085324
You are surprised at what you see here	30.151209713086224
But above all things I am a marvel to you	184.53128640812773
I am still young am I not Should you not have known me again in spite of my eightandforty years of age	81.29522006471777
On the contrary I do not find you the same person at all	53.375848243307324
I understand cried Athos with a gentle blush	831.9083008871271
Everything DArtagnan even folly has its limit	2832.219789304602
Then your means it appears are improved you have a capital houseyour own I presume You have a park and horses servants	697.8251450890943
Yes I inherited this little property when I quitted the army as I told you	64.59760639002
The park is twenty acrestwenty comprising kitchengardens and a common	3824.9239046455027
I have two horsesI do not count my servants bobtailed nag	981.1839071528626
My sporting dogs consist of two pointers two harriers and two setters	1436.267303639536
But then all this extravagance is not for myself added Athos laughing	326.8353979664672
Yes I see for the young man Raoul said DArtagnan	179.6119195807274
You guess aright my friend this youth is an orphan deserted by his mother who left him in the house of a poor country priest	93.6510657758648
It is Raoul who has worked in me the change you see I was dried up like a miserable tree isolated attached to nothing on earth it was only a deep affection that could make me take root again and drag me back to life	180.91673974150353
This child has caused me to recover what I had lost	66.29663770567366
I had no longer any wish to live for myself I have lived for him	35.7612408062713
I have corrected the vices that I had I have assumed the virtues that I had not	81.67284758373295
I may be mistaken but I believe that Raoul will be as accomplished a gentleman as our degenerate age could display	284.0584282729569
The remembrance of Milady recurred to DArtagnan	326.79787710893646
And you are happy he said to his friend	10.14336489725173
As happy as it is allowed to one of Gods creatures to be on this earth but say out all you think DArtagnan for you have not yet done so	123.34370037670269
You are too bad Athos one can hide nothing from you answered DArtagnan	195.73073141097487
I wished to ask you if you ever feel any emotions of terror resembling	171.77230101034002
I do not feel remorse because that woman I profoundly hold deserved her punishment	3212.4384738988815
Had she one redeeming trait I doubt it	48.14876423910803
I do not feel remorse because had we allowed her to live she would have persisted in her work of destruction	261.07291235964055
But I do not mean my friend that we were right in what we did	95.80857176870629
Perhaps all blood demands some expiation	65241.540502683194
Hers had been accomplished it remains possibly for us to accomplish ours	549.9583055753066
I have sometimes thought as you do Athos	239.657031709643
She had a son that unhappy woman	1036.3448344982135
Have you ever heard of him	32.4902906549807
He must be about twentythree years of age said Athos in a low tone	17.513475568326736
I often think of that young man DArtagnan	248.18144125962138
Strange for I had forgotten him said the lieutenant	71.2834007475186
Athos smiled the smile was melancholy	875.6915557679308
And Lord de Winterdo you know anything about him	134.65379199232027
I know that he is in high favor with Charles I	286.2853549141574
The fortunes of that monarch now are at low water	862.4048359944537
He shed the blood of Strafford that confirms what I said just nowblood will have blood	968.3616640427834
Madame Henrietta of England daughter of Henry IV	100.07261133348335
She is at the Louvre as you know	62.53490881706854
Yes and I hear in bitter poverty	1451.325316738761
Her daughter during the severest cold was obliged for want of fire to remain in bed	155.73741759732624
Do you grasp that said Athos shrugging his shoulders the daughter of Henry IV	77.36755646066987
shivering for want of a fagot Why did she not ask from any one of us a home instead of from Mazarin She should have wanted nothing	230.2430404221846
Have you ever seen the queen of England inquired DArtagnan	417.0627119948746
No but my mother as a child saw her	70.67694364126328
Did I ever tell you that my mother was lady of honor to Marie de Medici	118.51013841202042
You know Athos you never spoke much of such matters	469.3933634473673
Ah mon Dieu yes you are right Athos replied but then there must be some occasion for speaking	155.12195046844926
Porthos would nt have waited for it so patiently said DArtagnan with a smile	51.17956468043219
Every one according to his nature my dear DArtagnan	438.656623833672
Porthos in spite of a touch of vanity has many excellent qualities	1648.4679079954408
I left him five days ago said DArtagnan and he portrayed with Gascon wit and sprightliness the magnificence of Porthos in his Chateau of Pierrefonds nor did he neglect to launch a few arrows of wit at the excellent Monsieur Mouston	451.1958936033336
I sometimes wonder replied Athos smiling at that gayety which recalled the good old days that we could form an association of men who would be after twenty years of separation still so closely bound together	164.2694238010647
Friendship throws out deep roots in honest hearts DArtagnan	3797.907364987129
Believe me it is only the evilminded who deny friendship they can not understand it	353.4413306438559
I have seen him also said DArtagnan but he seemed to me cold	91.10815394582302
Ah you have seen Aramis said Athos turning on DArtagnan a searching look	288.7337998715035
Why it is a veritable pilgrimage my dear friend that you are making to the Temple of Friendship as the poets would say	165.40644106245148
Why yes replied DArtagnan with embarrassment	302951.02765663556
Aramis you know continued Athos is naturally cold and then he is always involved in intrigues with women	335.7004755791581
I believe he is at this moment in a very complicated one said DArtagnan	163.93500406382498
He is not curious thought DArtagnan	11214.73252372883
Athos not only failed to reply he even changed the subject of conversation	151.29864205513076
You see said he calling DArtagnans attention to the fact that they had come back to the chateau after an hours walk we have made a tour of my domains	176.624951827857
All is charming and everything savors of nobility replied DArtagnan	1703.7306869845027
At this instant they heard the sound of horses feet	67.53742143499782
Tis Raoul who has come back said Athos and we can now hear how the poor child is	109.21868316305311
In fact the young man appeared at the gate covered with dust entered the courtyard leaped from his horse which he consigned to the charge of a groom and then went to greet the count and DArtagnan	70.51784874176094
Monsieur said Athos placing his hand on DArtagnans shoulder monsieur is the Chevalier DArtagnan of whom you have often heard me speak Raoul	187.0058831610724
Monsieur said the young man saluting again and more profoundly monsieur le comte has pronounced your name before me as an example whenever he wished to speak of an intrepid and generous gentleman	277.0917694593321
That little compliment could not fail to move DArtagnan	381.0952490694769
He extended a hand to Raoul and said	280.66732645752575
My young friend all the praises that are given me should be passed on to the count here for he has educated me in everything and it is not his fault that his pupil profited so little from his instructions	158.41412012357256
But he will make it up in you I am sure	44.7794989304304
I like your manner Raoul and your politeness has touched me	87.56309659355378
Athos was more delighted than can be told	464.9513264959502
He looked at DArtagnan with an expression of gratitude and then bestowed on Raoul one of those strange smiles of which children are so proud when they receive them	92.12317429631948
Now said DArtagnan to himself noticing that silent play of countenance I am sure of it	185.12091992572604
I hope the accident has been of no consequence	66.740290305312
They do nt yet know sir on account of the swelling but the doctor is afraid some tendon has been injured	215.15080523105715
At this moment a little boy half peasant half footboy came to announce supper	1338.844479190575
Athos led his guest into a diningroom of moderate size the windows of which opened on one side on a garden on the other on a hothouse full of magnificent flowers	97.08159374688225
DArtagnan glanced at the dinner service	12436.648299572982
The plate was magnificent old and appertaining to the family	82.53121490329369
DArtagnan stopped to look at a sideboard on which was a superb ewer of silver	343.533754664078
That workmanship is divine he exclaimed	106.71123394954212
Yes a chef doeuvre of the great Florentine sculptor Benvenuto Cellini replied Athos	6563.575543340086
That of Marignan just at the point where one of my forefathers is offering his sword to Francis I	361.26414883055673
It was on that occasion that my ancestor Enguerrand de la Fere was made a knight of the Order of St	271.74551058549406
Michael besides which the king fifteen years afterward gave him also this ewer and a sword which you may have seen formerly in my house also a lovely specimen of workmanship	301.1569564413157
Men were giants in those times said Athos now we are pigmies in comparison	409.22179641307855
Let us sit down to supper	24567.190175374923
Call Charles he added addressing the boy who waited	112.36416543760937
My good Charles I particularly recommend to your care Planchet the laquais of Monsieur DArtagnan	1121.0632608112949
He likes good wine now you have the key of the cellar	48.663326934211966
He has slept a long time on a hard bed so he wo nt object to a soft one take every care of him I beg of you	125.38141125220807
You think of everything said DArtagnan and I thank you for Planchet my dear Athos	113.84120320517745
Raoul stared on hearing this name and looked at the count to be quite sure that it was he whom the lieutenant thus addressed	85.13110007124918
That name sounds strange to you said Athos smiling it was my nom de guerre when Monsieur DArtagnan two other gallant friends and myself performed some feats of arms at the siege of La Rochelle under the deceased cardinal and Monsieur de Bassompierre	410.81535748933203
My friend is still so kind as to address me by that old and well beloved appellation which makes my heart glad when I hear it	154.66318843697132
Tis an illustrious name said the lieutenant and had one day triumphal honors paid to it	421.80294443762483
What do you mean sir inquired Raoul	599.109647077428
Gervais Athos and the napkin which was converted into a banner and he then related to Raoul the story of the bastion and Raoul fancied he was listening to one of those deeds of arms belonging to days of chivalry so gloriously recounted by Tasso and Ariosto	265.4366702857857
DArtagnan does not tell you Raoul said Athos in his turn that he was reckoned one of the finest swordsmen of his timea knuckle of iron a wrist of steel a sure eye and a glance of fire that s what his adversary met with	176.6099265376989
He was eighteen only three years older than you are Raoul when I saw him set to work pitted against tried men	439.5046442710075
And did Monsieur DArtagnan come off the conqueror asked the young man with glistening eye	114.37535670395853
I killed one man if I recollect rightly replied DArtagnan with a look of inquiry directed to Athos another I disarmed or wounded I do nt remember which	270.9574169603669
Wounded said Athos it was a phenomenon of skill	937.7023648259609
The young man would willingly have prolonged this conversation far into the night but Athos pointed out to him that his guest must need repose	322.83223380412045
DArtagnan would fain have declared that he was not fatigued but Athos insisted on his retiring to his chamber conducted thither by Raoul	368.0059311484316
DArtagnan retired to bednot to sleep but to think over all he had heard that evening	117.04023903323429
Being naturally goodhearted and having had once a liking for Athos which had grown into a sincere friendship he was delighted at thus meeting a man full of intelligence and moral strength instead of a drunkard	300.80794933411323
He admitted without annoyance the continued superiority of Athos over himself devoid as he was of that jealousy which might have saddened a less generous disposition he was delighted also that the high qualities of Athos appeared to promise favorably for his mission	540.6952501652241
Nevertheless it seemed to him that Athos was not in all respects sincere and frank	661.3163042742991
Who was the youth he had adopted and who bore so striking a resemblance to him What could explain Athoss having reentered the world and the extreme sobriety he had observed at table The absence of Grimaud whose name had never once been uttered by Athos gave DArtagnan uneasiness	357.1883502593194
It was evident either that he no longer possessed the confidence of his friend or that Athos was bound by some invisible chain or that he had been forewarned of the lieutenants visit	122.60621384295459
He could not help thinking of M	57.01422213609613
Rochefort whom he had seen in Notre Dame could De Rochefort have forestalled him with Athos Again the moderate fortune which Athos possessed concealed as it was so skillfully seemed to show a regard for appearances and to betray a latent ambition which might be easily aroused	507.9879560586457
The clear and vigorous intellect of Athos would render him more open to conviction than a less able man would be	236.2666528021035
He would enter into the ministers schemes with the more ardor because his natural activity would be doubled by necessity	450.4623633823653
Resolved to seek an explanation on all these points on the following day DArtagnan in spite of his fatigue prepared for an attack and determined that it should take place after breakfast	122.67662204141452
He determined to cultivate the goodwill of the youth Raoul and either whilst fencing with him or when out shooting to extract from his simplicity some information which would connect the Athos of old times with the Athos of the present	453.0625084130956
But DArtagnan at the same time being a man of extreme caution was quite aware what injury he should do himself if by any indiscretion or awkwardness he should betray has manoeuvering to the experienced eye of Athos	316.83067428694517
Besides to tell truth whilst DArtagnan was quite disposed to adopt a subtle course against the cunning of Aramis or the vanity of Porthos he was ashamed to equivocate with Athos truehearted open Athos	499.3865656607033
It seemed to him that if Porthos and Aramis deemed him superior to them in the arts of diplomacy they would like him all the better for it but that Athos on the contrary would despise him	221.2126192056665
Ah why is not Grimaud the taciturn Grimaud here thought DArtagnan there are so many things his silence would have told me with Grimaud silence was another form of eloquence	337.8334417244741
There reigned a perfect stillness in the house	15.12928736329347
DArtagnan had heard the door shut and the shutters barred the dogs became in their turn silent	225.0854021980211
At last a nightingale lost in a thicket of shrubs in the midst of its most melodious cadences had fluted low and lower into stillness and fallen asleep	337.91627411744383
Not a sound was heard in the castle except of a footstep up and down in the chamber aboveas he supposed the bedroom of Athos	217.7725292819101
He is walking about and thinking thought DArtagnan but of what It is impossible to know everything else might be guessed but not that	165.06480007428527
At length Athos went to bed apparently for the noise ceased	158.5967070883821
Silence and fatigue together overcame DArtagnan and sleep overtook him also	903.38656870111
He was not however a good sleeper	5641.731874281145
Scarcely had dawn gilded his window curtains when he sprang out of bed and opened the windows	71.37130779464628
Somebody he perceived was in the courtyard moving stealthily	2197.3376582680717
True to his custom of never passing anything over that it was within his power to know DArtagnan looked out of the window and perceived the close red coat and brown hair of Raoul	137.91146834395244
The young man was opening the door of the stable	17.993349455130627
He then with noiseless haste took out the horse that he had ridden on the previous evening saddled and bridled it himself and led the animal into the alley to the right of the kitchengarden opened a side door which conducted him to a bridle road shut it after him and DArtagnan saw him pass by like a dart bending as he went beneath the pendent flowery branches of maple and acacia	192.25947166736515
The road as DArtagnan had observed was the way to Blois	225.4988575702483
So thought the Gascon heres a young blade who has already his love affair who does nt at all agree with Athos in his hatred to the fair sex	314.96392875690515
He s not going to hunt for he has neither dogs nor arms he s not going on a message for he goes secretly	355.80488184018884
Why does he go in secret Is he afraid of me or of his father for I am sure the count is his father	70.61301730251657
By Jove I shall know about that soon for I shall soon speak out to Athos	206.91213316649166
Day was now advanced all the noises that had ceased the night before reawakened one after the other	137.43400786442137
The bird on the branch the dog in his kennel the sheep in the field the boats moored in the Loire even became alive and vocal	636.9913132168463
The latter leaving the shore abandoned themselves gaily to the current	1132.2762240347856
The Gascon gave a last twirl to his mustache a last turn to his hair brushed from habit the brim of his hat with the sleeve of his doublet and went downstairs	214.9799486817649
Scarcely had he descended the last step of the threshold when he saw Athos bent down toward the ground as if he were looking for a crownpiece in the dust	68.04361503696612
Goodmorning my dear host cried DArtagnan	6299.19753192274
Goodday to you have you slept well	1183.2526241728087
Excellently Athos but what are you looking for You are perhaps a tulip fancier	373.27819842358286
My dear friend if I am you must not laugh at me for being so	88.49322849691454
In the country people alter one gets to like without knowing it all those beautiful objects that God causes to spring from the earth which are despised in cities	479.8028968400639
I was looking anxiously for some iris roots I planted here close to this reservoir and which some one has trampled upon this morning	453.96880769659805
These gardeners are the most careless people in the world in bringing the horse out to the water they ve allowed him to walk over the border	162.61140529296006
Ah you think so do you	6.253312267473167
And he took his friend along the alley where a number of tracks like those which had trampled down the flowerbeds were visible	246.61879450717973
Here are the horses hoofs again it seems Athos he said carelessly	258.09390906270306
Yes indeed the marks are recent	15458.393478686488
Who went out this morning Athos asked uneasily	1198.9155048254493
Not likely answered the Gascon these marks are regular	1360.9252668524027
Where is Raoul asked Athos how is it that I have not seen him	20.326509803402132
Hush exclaimed DArtagnan putting his finger on his lips and he related what he had seen watching Athos all the while	78.02532910070003
Ah he s gone to Blois the poor boy	894.3483667458561
Ah to inquire after the little La Valliere she has sprained her foot you know	505.1400079074312
I am sure of it said Athos do nt you see that Raoul is in love	94.3113961610082
Indeed with whomwith a child seven years old	160.48830641482962
Dear friend at Raouls age the heart is so expansive that it must encircle one object or another fancied or real	571.4534717460114
Well his love is half real half fanciful	2711.436534654531
She is the prettiest little creature in the world with flaxen hair blue eyesat once saucy and languishing	803.1937990071353
But what say you to Raouls fancy	32525.605042114476
NothingI laugh at Raoul but this first desire of the heart is imperious	281.13124705781837
I remember just at his age how deep in love I was with a Grecian statue which our good king then Henry IV	379.952967767207
gave my father insomuch that I was mad with grief when they told me that the story of Pygmalion was nothing but a fable	81.75689406392682
It is mere want of occupation	50383.993672184035
You do not make Raoul work so he takes his own way of employing himself	295.6197475381405
Exactly therefore I think of sending him away from here	167.49572483530045
You will be wise to do so	7.745658724762851
No doubt of it but it will break his heart	98.13775324859391
So long as three or four years ago he used to adorn and adore his little idol whom he will some day fall in love with in right earnest if he remains here	287.586381934988
The parents of little La Valliere have for a long time perceived and been amused at it now they begin to look concerned	391.3420949892464
Nonsense However Raoul must be diverted from this fancy	652.0451864817062
Send him away or you will never make a man of him	35.58023982688616
I think I shall send him to Paris	13.329499266976816
So thought DArtagnan and it seemed to him that the moment for attack had arrived	51.03806394350865
Suppose he said we roughly chalk out a career for this young man	352.7886174536298
I wish to consult you about some thing	246.6400437314322
Do you think it is time for us to enter the service	26.682237922736515
But are you not still in the serviceyou DArtagnan	1655.070460487346
Our former life has it still no attractions for you would you not be happy to begin anew in my society and in that of Porthos the exploits of our youth	167.73353567753315
Do you propose to me to do so DArtagnan	118.72456557156266
On whose side asked Athos fixing his clear benevolent glance on the countenance of the Gascon	82.24029059834483
Ah devil take it you speak in earnest	362.2547931251231
And must have a definite answer	306.04320126227486
There is but one person or rather one cause to whom a man like me can be usefulthat of the king	207.36729556365077
Yes but let us understand each other returned Athos seriously	961.8905077668129
If by the cause of the king you mean that of Monsieur de Mazarin we do not understand each other	71.62599804295157
I do nt say exactly answered the Gascon confused	422.3948660091786
Come DArtagnan do nt let us play a sidelong game your hesitation your evasion tells me at once on whose side you are for that party no one dares openly to recruit and when people recruit for it it is with averted eyes and humble voice	603.6555012219118
You know that I am not alluding to you you are the pearl of brave bold men	234.406685804267
I speak of that spiteful and intriguing Italianof the pedant who has tried to put on his own head a crown which he stole from under a pillowof the scoundrel who calls his party the party of the kingwho wants to send the princes of the blood to prison not daring to kill them as our great cardinalour cardinal didof the miser who weighs his gold pieces and keeps the clipped ones for fear though he is rich of losing them at play next morningof the impudent fellow who insults the queen as they sayso much the worse for herand who is going in three months to make war upon us in order that he may retain his pensions is that the master whom you propose to me I thank you DArtagnan	309.9077669422639
You are more impetuous than you were returned DArtagnan	373.1187582487329
Age has warmed not chilled your blood	236.69503876910235
Who informed you this was the master I propose to you Devil take it he muttered to himself do nt let me betray my secrets to a man not inclined to entertain them	142.60435901358875
Well then said Athos what are your schemes what do you propose	108.64028871825094
You live on your estate happy in golden mediocrity	6294.043804975908
Porthos has perhaps sixty thousand francs income	395.9001385890621
Aramis has always fifty duchesses quarreling over the priest as they quarreled formerly over the musketeer but Iwhat have I in the world I have worn my cuirass these twenty years kept down in this inferior rank without going forward or backward hardly half living	628.4688589039423
Well when there is some idea of being resuscitated you say he s a scoundrel an impudent fellow a miser a bad master By Jove I am of your opinion but find me a better one or give me the means of living	249.92065164865622
Athos was for a few moments thoughtful	600.6001648399206
Good DArtagnan is for Mazarin he said to himself	13.75095564752517
From that moment he grew very guarded	8705.485987573757
On his side DArtagnan became more cautious also	2902.9270091347475
You spoke to me Athos resumed of Porthos have you persuaded him to seek his fortune But he has wealth I believe already	393.6934912411268
But such is man we always want something more than we already have	174.39161623044612
Ah true I forgot said Athos laughing	1572.5448446216162
Tis true thought the Gascon where has he heard it Does he correspond with Aramis Ah if I knew that he did I should know all	205.3768199677379
The conversation was interrupted by the entrance of Raoul	63.82263512650742
Is our little neighbor worse asked DArtagnan seeing a look of vexation on the face of the youth	57.357201206819006
Ah sir replied Raoul her fall is a very serious one and without any ostensible injury the physician fears she will be lame for life	325.3898219669613
And what makes me all the more wretched sir is that I was the cause of this misfortune	57.228476304737995
It was to run to meet me that she leaped from that pile of wood	197.82138440680853
There s only one remedy dear Raoulthat is to marry her as a compensation	315.3789174295951
Ah sir answered Raoul you joke about a real misfortune that is cruel indeed	371.67945834818454
The good understanding between the two friends was not in the least altered by the mornings skirmish	183.52112346037836
They breakfasted with a good appetite looking now and then at poor Raoul who with moist eyes and a full heart scarcely ate at all	402.8552661360667
After breakfast two letters arrived for Athos who read them with profound attention whilst DArtagnan could not restrain himself from jumping up several times on seeing him read these epistles in one of which there being at the time a very strong light he perceived the fine writing of Aramis	205.7758477262346
The other was in a feminine hand long and crossed	1508.7756080168786
Come said DArtagnan to Raoul seeing that Athos wished to be alone come let us take a turn in the fencing gallery that will amuse you	195.13744012431334
And they both went into a low room where there were foils gloves masks breastplates and all the accessories for a fencing match	528.740630890412
In a quarter of an hour Athos joined them and at the same moment Charles brought in a letter for DArtagnan which a messenger had just desired might be instantly delivered	221.39198685706629
It was now Athoss turn to take a sly look	99.09399175713725
DArtagnan read the letter with apparent calmness and said shaking his head	73.13597558096461
See dear friend what it is to belong to the army	44.779292078283326
Faith you are indeed right not to return to it	41.30383972620128
Monsieur de Trville is ill so my company ca nt do without me there my leave is at an end	144.33064630429888
Do you return to Paris asked Athos quickly	272.2611872783149
Egad yes but why do nt you come there also	54.480146527066076
Athos colored a little and answered	2512.742770388022
Should I go I shall be delighted to see you there	37.298554000930174
Halloo Planchet cried the Gascon from the door we must set out in ten minutes give the horses some hay	94.87025118427208
Then turning to Athos he added	66.56864057583078
I seem to miss something here	180.64446521186503
I am really sorry to go away without having seen Grimaud	202.52987695940217
I m surprised you have never so much as asked after him	112.357809759933
I have lent him to a friend	62.534362138374235
Who will understand the signs he makes returned DArtagnan	2180.0389580217484
The friends embraced cordially DArtagnan pressed Raouls hand	5818.940901669195
Will you not come with me he said I shall pass by Blois	73.30179586206059
Raoul turned toward Athos who showed him by a secret sign that he did not wish him to go	34.613635178372284
No monsieur replied the young man I will remain with monsieur le comte	106.27245804581801
Adieu then to both my good friends said DArtagnan may God preserve you as we used to say when we said goodbye to each other in the late cardinals time	154.74559574014222
Athos waved his hand Raoul bowed and DArtagnan and Planchet set out	234.65846320958545
The count followed them with his eyes his hands resting on the shoulders of the youth whose height was almost equal to his own but as soon as they were out of sight he said	36.21311452338756
Raoul we set out tonight for Paris	49.11355167868245
Eh cried the young man turning pale	20.18097196605705
You may go and offer your adieux and mine to Madame de SaintRemy	219.86410101540224
I shall wait for you here till seven	385.10848213459167
The young man bent low with an expression of sorrow and gratitude mingled and retired in order to saddle his horse	67.12572406584837
As to DArtagnan scarcely on his side was he out of sight when he drew from his pocket a letter which he read over again	34.982948664421826
The epistle is laconic said DArtagnan and if there had not been a postscript probably I should not have understood it but happily there is a postscript	96.47838289990156
And he read that welcome postscript which made him forget the abruptness of the letter	172.5292318680836
Go to the kings treasurer at Blois tell him your name and show him this letter you will receive two hundred pistoles	150.7671484552084
Assuredly said DArtagnan I admire this piece of prose	372.956700047531
The cardinal writes better than I thought	43.76700567986944
Come Planchet let us pay a visit to the kings treasurer and then set off	72.92469548602762
And they set out at as hard a canter as their horses could maintain	1198.7829124270995
The circumstances that had hastened the return of DArtagnan to Paris were as follows	166.70845277534383
One evening when Mazarin according to custom went to visit the queen in passing the guardchamber he heard loud voices wishing to know on what topic the soldiers were conversing he approached with his wonted wolflike step pushed open the door and put his head close to the chink	288.0758760560708
There was a dispute among the guards	248.31067491926947
I tell you one of them was saying that if Coysel predicted that tis as good as true I know nothing about it but I have heard say that he s not only an astrologer but a magician	201.5230129112803
Deuce take it friend if he s one of thy friends thou wilt ruin him in saying so	187.77882637614883
Because he may be tried for it	23.840169135886544
Ah absurd they do nt burn sorcerers nowadays	31771.443214077826
No Tis not a long time since the late cardinal burnt Urban Grandier though	1105.09204918582
My friend Urban Grandier was nt a sorcerer he was a learned man	200.43156275127347
He did nt predict the future he knew the pastoften a more dangerous thing	518.4421647591643
Mazarin nodded an assent but wishing to know what this prediction was about which they disputed he remained in the same place	135.50687306945883
I do nt say resumed the guard that Coysel is not a sorcerer but I say that if his prophecy gets wind its a sure way to prevent its coming true	507.661816633407
Why in this way if Coysel says loud enough for the cardinal to hear him on such or such a day such a prisoner will escape tis plain that the cardinal will take measures of precaution and that the prisoner will not escape	256.92477979243495
Good Lord said another guard who might have been thought asleep on a bench but who had lost not a syllable of the conversation do you suppose that men can escape their destiny If it is written yonder in Heaven that the Duc de Beaufort is to escape he will escape and all the precautions of the cardinal will not prevent it	123.68749425724774
He was an Italian and therefore superstitious	6799.951723311465
He walked straight into the midst of the guards who on seeing him were silent	81.92852677427136
What were you saying he asked with his flattering manner that Monsieur de Beaufort had escaped were you not	128.40513675155742
Oh no my lord said the incredulous soldier	1447.4095922509762
He s well guarded now we only said he would escape	120.77304533903201
Repeat your story Saint Laurent replied the man turning to the originator of the tale	81.58762115132758
My lord said the guard I have simply mentioned the prophecy I heard from a man named Coysel who believes that be he ever so closely watched and guarded the Duke of Beaufort will escape before Whitsuntide	352.1484479169368
Coysel is a madman returned the cardinal	152.11984947466044
No replied the soldier tenacious in his credulity he has foretold many things which have come to pass for instance that the queen would have a son that Monsieur Coligny would be killed in a duel with the Duc de Guise and finally that the coadjutor would be made cardinal	122.57804406726345
Well the queen has not only one son but two then Monsieur de Coligny was killed and	202.5927421552835
Yes said Mazarin but the coadjutor is not yet made cardinal	294.14023974401465
No my lord but he will be answered the guard	186.8298103222948
Mazarin made a grimace as if he meant to say But he does not wear the cardinals cap then he added	98.05602784885433
So my friend its your opinion that Monsieur de Beaufort will escape	250.55965707523995
That s my idea my lord and if your eminence were to offer to make me at this moment governor of the castle of Vincennes I should refuse it	72.9575037757826
After Whitsuntide it would be another thing	416.43332315210944
There is nothing so convincing as a firm conviction	188.02013899717892
It has its own effect upon the most incredulous and far from being incredulous Mazarin was superstitious	565.7784474142816
He went away thoughtful and anxious and returned to his own room where he summoned Bernouin and desired him to fetch thither in the morning the special guard he had placed over Monsieur de Beaufort and to awaken him whenever he should arrive	151.7484141138164
The guard had in fact touched the cardinal in the tenderest point	528.4499097675991
During the whole five years in which the Duc de Beaufort had been in prison not a day had passed in which the cardinal had not felt a secret dread of his escape	74.1053315961662
It was not possible as he knew well to confine for the whole of his life the grandson of Henry IV	135.83244771914715
especially when this young prince was scarcely thirty years of age	28.644499494285355
But however and whensoever he did escape what hatred he must cherish against him to whom he owed his long imprisonment who had taken him rich brave glorious beloved by women feared by men to cut off his lifes best happiest years for it is not life it is merely existence in prison Meantime Mazarin redoubled his surveillance over the duke	385.4177451244928
But like the miser in the fable he could not sleep for thinking of his treasure	117.897006080879
Often he awoke in the night suddenly dreaming that he had been robbed of Monsieur de Beaufort	218.7623747141529
Then he inquired about him and had the vexation of hearing that the prisoner played drank sang but that whilst playing drinking singing he often stopped short to vow that Mazarin should pay dear for all the amusements he had forced him to enter into at Vincennes	477.2133972313485
So much did this one idea haunt the cardinal even in his sleep that when at seven in the morning Bernouin came to arouse him his first words were Well what s the matter Has Monsieur de Beaufort escaped from Vincennes	387.35537342102293
I do not think so my lord said Bernouin but you will hear about him for La Ramee is here and awaits the commands of your eminence	130.13956779278706
Tell him to come in said Mazarin arranging his pillows so that he might receive the visitor sitting up in bed	197.13478828050808
The officer entered a large fat man with an open physiognomy	414.36251323539
His air of perfect serenity made Mazarin uneasy	4122.04085684303
Do you know what they are saying here	58.14546853596622
Well they say that Monsieur de Beaufort is going to escape from Vincennes if he has not done so already	83.68443866694177
The officers face expressed complete stupefaction	38101.42688310202
He opened at once his little eyes and his great mouth to inhale better the joke his eminence deigned to address to him and ended by a burst of laughter so violent that his great limbs shook in hilarity as they would have done in an ague	200.42547305565665
Escape my lordescape Your eminence does not then know where Monsieur de Beaufort is	88.01390231665917
Yes I do sir in the donjon of Vincennes	275.0522861273598
Yes sir in a room the walls of which are seven feet thick with grated windows each bar as thick as my arm	367.7974611137587
Sir replied Mazarin with perseverance one may penetrate through a wall with a watchspring one may saw through an iron bar	335.3666593811011
Then my lord does not know that there are eight guards about him four in his chamber four in the antechamber and that they never leave him	129.1910412045722
But he leaves his room he plays at tennis at the Mall	579.9569099705989
Sir those amusements are allowed but if your eminence wishes it we will discontinue the permission	289.2329178179724
No no cried Mazarin fearing that should his prisoner ever leave his prison he would be the more exasperated against him if he thus retrenched his amusement	358.0341583248569
He then asked with whom he played	191.79738090415697
My lord either with the officers of the guard with the other prisoners or with me	146.11326667064301
But does he not approach the walls while playing	393.4414224015689
Your eminence does nt know those walls they are sixty feet high and I doubt if Monsieur de Beaufort is sufficiently weary of life to risk his neck by jumping off	301.24046063301006
Hum said the cardinal beginning to feel more comfortable	252.9804470870269
You mean to say then my dear Monsieur la Ramee	521.305111438497
That unless Monsieur de Beaufort can contrive to metamorphose himself into a little bird I will continue answerable for him	296.40920294180586
Take care you assert a great deal said Mazarin	157.79351068506767
Monsieur de Beaufort told the guards who took him to Vincennes that he had often thought what he should do in case he were put into prison and that he had found out forty ways of escaping	150.8374426244074
My lord if among these forty there had been one good way he would have been out long ago	129.09361896895902
Come come not such a fool as I fancied thought Mazarin	945.1494804005349
Besides my lord must remember that Monsieur de Chavigny is governor of Vincennes continued La Ramee and that Monsieur de Chavigny is not friendly to Monsieur de Beaufort	258.6940075434682
Yes but Monsieur de Chavigny is sometimes absent	518.3947982634628
When he is absent I am there	66.02341651309816
But when you leave him for instance	64.43028134022742
Oh when I leave him I place in my stead a bold fellow who aspires to be his majestys special guard	633.334153929641
I promise you he keeps a good watch over the prisoner	87.95080054591496
During the three weeks that he has been with me I have only had to reproach him with one thingbeing too severe with the prisoners	94.3749457391725
A certain Monsieur Grimaud my lord	56.24399757211272
And what was he before he went to Vincennes	116.3351211623032
He was in the country as I was told by the person who recommended him to me	34.57650433820205
And who recommended this man to you	48.67766444371361
The steward of the Duc de Grammont	59.205849707598915
He is not a gossip I hope	106.18097189054393
Lord a mercy my lord I thought for a long time that he was dumb he answers only by signs	115.72601453055626
It seems his former master accustomed him to that	216.36288026811476
Well dear Monsieur la Ramee replied the cardinal let him prove a true and thankful keeper and we will shut our eyes upon his rural misdeeds and put on his back a uniform to make him respectable and in the pockets of that uniform some pistoles to drink to the kings health	250.3542980119584
Mazarin was large in promisesquite unlike the virtuous Monsieur Grimaud so bepraised by La Ramee for he said nothing and did much	931.4225821501501
The cardinal therefore got up perfumed himself dressed and went to the queen to tell her what had detained him	241.21652273544115
The queen who was scarcely less afraid of Monsieur de Beaufort than the cardinal himself and who was almost as superstitious as he was made him repeat word for word all La Ramees praises of his deputy	234.63103670156528
Then when the cardinal had ended	5426.69627958922
Alas sir why have we not a Grimaud near every prince	864.9704910637987
Patience replied Mazarin with his Italian smile that may happen one day but in the meantime	101.3683520596799
And he wrote to DArtagnan to hasten his return	179.8287873920993
Duc de Beaufort amused his Leisure Hours in the Donjon of Vincennes	825.064917860769
The captive who was the source of so much alarm to the cardinal and whose means of escape disturbed the repose of the whole court was wholly unconscious of the terror he caused at the Palais Royal	154.06070309250424
He had found himself so strictly guarded that he soon perceived the fruitlessness of any attempt at escape	503.38874174677323
His vengeance therefore consisted in coining curses on the head of Mazarin he even tried to make some verses on him but soon gave up the attempt for Monsieur de Beaufort had not only not received from Heaven the gift of versifying he had the greatest difficulty in expressing himself in prose	222.22527727733282
The duke was the grandson of Henry IV	77.54970516362776
and Gabrielle dEstreesas goodnatured as brave as proud and above all as Gascon as his ancestor but less elaborately educated	537.5980762631923
After having been for some time after the death of Louis XIII	33.80157674342387
the favorite the confidant the first man in short at the court he had been obliged to yield his place to Mazarin and so became the second in influence and favor and eventually as he was stupid enough to be vexed at this change of position the queen had had him arrested and sent to Vincennes in charge of Guitant who made his appearance in these pages in the beginning of this history and whom we shall see again	159.13206801390274
It is understood of course that when we say the queen Mazarin is meant	288.3230712149122
During the five years of this seclusion which would have improved and matured the intellect of any other man M	362.6794807554742
de Beaufort had he not affected to brave the cardinal despise princes and walk alone without adherents or disciples would either have regained his liberty or made partisans	1043.0997999682959
But these considerations never occurred to the duke and every day the cardinal received fresh accounts of him which were as unpleasant as possible to the minister	130.39937738951238
After having failed in poetry Monsieur de Beaufort tried drawing	1687.846149073373
He drew portraits with a piece of coal of the cardinal and as his talents did not enable him to produce a very good likeness he wrote under the picture that there might be little doubt regarding the original Portrait of the Illustrious Coxcomb Mazarin	342.9927848788941
Monsieur de Chavigny the governor of Vincennes waited upon the duke to request that he would amuse himself in some other way or that at all events if he drew likenesses he would not put mottoes underneath them	251.30999604432614
The next day the prisoners room was full of pictures and mottoes	212.9520598878949
Monsieur de Beaufort in common with many other prisoners was bent upon doing things that were prohibited and the only resource the governor had was one day when the duke was playing at tennis to efface all these drawings consisting chiefly of profiles	640.0407439412623
de Beaufort did not venture to draw the cardinals fat face	259.9877187925795
The duke thanked Monsieur de Chavigny for having as he said cleaned his drawingpaper for him he then divided the walls of his room into compartments and dedicated each of these compartments to some incident in Mazarins life	439.0732643190813
In one was depicted the Illustrious Coxcomb receiving a shower of blows from Cardinal Bentivoglio whose servant he had been another the Illustrious Mazarin acting the part of Ignatius Loyola in a tragedy of that name a third the Illustrious Mazarin stealing the portfolio of prime minister from Monsieur de Chavigny who had expected to have it a fourth the Illustrious Coxcomb Mazarin refusing to give Laporte the young kings valet clean sheets and saving that it was quite enough for the king of France to have clean sheets every three months	510.16385757686436
The governor of course thought proper to threaten his prisoner that if he did not give up drawing such pictures he should be obliged to deprive him of all the means of amusing himself in that manner	144.48684636227594
To this Monsieur de Beaufort replied that since every opportunity of distinguishing himself in arms was taken from him he wished to make himself celebrated in the arts since he could not be a Bayard he would become a Raphael or a Michael Angelo	219.5923199989687
Nevertheless one day when Monsieur de Beaufort was walking in the meadow his fire was put out his charcoal all removed taken away and thus his means of drawing utterly destroyed	281.36737692913107
The poor duke swore fell into a rage yelled and declared that they wished to starve him to death as they had starved the Marechal Ornano and the Grand Prior of Vendome but he refused to promise that he would not make any more drawings and remained without any fire in the room all the winter	196.4669929072235
His next act was to purchase a dog from one of his keepers	186.62101491066235
With this animal which he called Pistache he was often shut up for hours alone superintending as every one supposed its education	750.0499641967339
At last when Pistache was sufficiently well trained Monsieur de Beaufort invited the governor and officers of Vincennes to attend a representation which he was going to have in his apartment	284.96204252956477
The party assembled the room was lighted with waxlights and the prisoner with a bit of plaster he had taken out of the wall of his room had traced a long white line representing a cord on the floor	74.36807568931397
Pistache on a signal from his master placed himself on this line raised himself on his hind paws and holding in his front paws a wand with which clothes used to be beaten he began to dance upon the line with as many contortions as a ropedancer	280.17166945616725
Having been several times up and down it he gave the wand back to his master and began without hesitation to perform the same evolutions over again	141.01510574351502
The intelligent creature was received with loud applause	388.32462909188024
The first part of the entertainment being concluded Pistache was desired to say what oclock it was he was shown Monsieur de Chavignys watch it was then halfpast six the dog raised and dropped his paw six times the seventh he let it remain upraised	643.6531911704811
Nothing could be better done a sundial could not have shown the hour with greater precision	245.00287023582663
Then the question was put to him who was the best jailer in all the prisons in France	82.64076781698738
The dog performed three evolutions around the circle and laid himself with the deepest respect at the feet of Monsieur de Chavigny who at first seemed inclined to like the joke and laughed long and loud but a frown succeeded and he bit his lips with vexation	190.60816014086097
Then the duke put to Pistache this difficult question who was the greatest thief in the world	252.68666645745037
Pistache went again around the circle but stopped at no one and at last went to the door and began to scratch and bark	152.1432005896736
de Beaufort this wonderful animal not finding here what I ask for seeks it out of doors you shall however have his answer	406.9049600941557
Is not the greatest thief in the world Monsieur the kings secretary Le Camus who came to Paris with twenty francs in his pocket and who now possesses ten millions	77.81518396958482
Then is it not resumed the duke the Superintendent Emery who gave his son when he was married three hundred thousand francs and a house compared to which the Tuileries are a heap of ruins and the Louvre a paltry building	168.32087269264792
The dog again shook his head as if to say no	20.906645951875273
Then said the prisoner lets think who it can be	379.27594839517553
Can it be can it possibly be the Illustrious Coxcomb Mazarin de Piscina hey	2261.0066637126856
Pistache made violent signs that it was by raising and lowering his head eight or ten times successively	157.3013425291155
Gentlemen you see said the duke to those present who dared not even smile that it is the Illustrious Coxcomb who is the greatest thief in the world at least according to Pistache	190.08232867806677
Let us go on to another of his exercises	516.4755109568349
Gentlementhere was a profound silence in the room when the duke again addressed themdo you not remember that the Duc de Guise taught all the dogs in Paris to jump for Mademoiselle de Pons whom he styled the fairest of the fair Pistache is going to show you how superior he is to all other dogs	230.31705613840222
Monsieur de Chavigny be so good as to lend me your cane	53.877296231343735
Monsieur de Chavigny handed his cane to Monsieur de Beaufort	181.4450562581523
Monsieur de Beaufort placed it horizontally at the height of one foot	365.90004403308455
Now Pistache my good dog jump the height of this cane for Madame de Montbazon	322.7266445191532
But interposed Monsieur de Chavigny it seems to me that Pistache is only doing what other dogs have done when they jumped for Mademoiselle de Pons	239.48448603654023
Stop said the duke Pistache jump for the queen	263.9742025676968
And he raised his cane six inches higher	1448.906788465997
The dog sprang and in spite of the height jumped lightly over it	160.63963470554896
And now said the duke raising it still six inches higher jump for the king	581.3683325715604
The dog obeyed and jumped quickly over the cane	177.39241925950446
Now then said the duke and as he spoke lowered the cane almost level with the ground Pistache my friend jump for the Illustrious Coxcomb Mazarin de Piscina	497.65767191918076
The dog turned his back to the cane	44.58449042478328
What asked the duke what do you mean and he gave him the cane again first making a semicircle from the head to the tail of Pistache	111.5551410210877
But Pistache as at first turned round on his legs and stood with his back to the cane	55.42339066494262
Monsieur de Beaufort made the experiment a third time but by this time Pistaches patience was exhausted he threw himself furiously upon the cane wrested it from the hands of the prince and broke it with his teeth	166.49272715639555
Monsieur de Beaufort took the pieces out of his mouth and presented them with great formality to Monsieur de Chavigny saying that for that evening the entertainment was ended but in three months it should be repeated when Pistache would have learned a few new tricks	184.53558440758425
Three days afterward Pistache was found deadpoisoned	17030.479730816085
Then the duke said openly that his dog had been killed by a drug with which they meant to poison him and one day after dinner he went to bed calling out that he had pains in his stomach and that Mazarin had poisoned him	111.57163548650959
This fresh impertinence reached the ears of the cardinal and alarmed him greatly	157.76220144248674
The donjon of Vincennes was considered very unhealthy and Madame de Rambouillet had said that the room in which the Marechal Ornano and the Grand Prior de Vendome had died was worth its weight in arsenica bon mot which had great success	472.8304262478373
So it was ordered the prisoner was henceforth to eat nothing that had not previously been tasted and La Ramee was in consequence placed near him as taster	432.5709299837214
Every kind of revenge was practiced upon the duke by the governor in return for the insults of the innocent Pistache	243.1071826342813
De Chavigny who according to report was a son of Richelieus and had been a creature of the late cardinals understood tyranny	301.6723806261557
He took from the duke all the steel knives and silver forks and replaced them with silver knives and wooden forks pretending that as he had been informed that the duke was to pass all his life at Vincennes he was afraid of his prisoner attempting suicide	294.6394426374375
A fortnight afterward the duke going to the tennis court found two rows of trees about the size of his little finger planted by the roadside he asked what they were for and was told that they were to shade him from the sun on some future day	159.49312046828493
One morning the gardener went to him and told him as if to please him that he was going to plant a bed of asparagus for his especial use	72.64895370236111
Now since as every one knows asparagus takes four years in coming to perfection this civility infuriated Monsieur de Beaufort	1392.5539314589598
At last his patience was exhausted	2618.0908135360155
He assembled his keepers and notwithstanding his wellknown difficulty of utterance addressed them as follows	661.206984867956
Gentlemen will you permit a grandson of Henry IV	419.0632247383037
to be overwhelmed with insults and ignominy	1582.9393199063045
Odds fish as my grandfather used to say I once reigned in Paris do you know that I had the king and Monsieur the whole of one day in my care	77.15089743390392
The queen at that time liked me and called me the most honest man in the kingdom	144.57590052844046
Gentlemen and citizens set me free I shall go to the Louvre and strangle Mazarin	132.1969921307246
I will make you all captains with good pensions Odds fish On march forward	8423.38478484041
But eloquent as he might be the eloquence of the grandson of Henry IV	127.40808232353298
did not touch those hearts of stone not one man stirred so Monsieur de Beaufort was obliged to be satisfied with calling them all kinds of rascals underneath the sun	326.73161913976674
Sometimes when Monsieur de Chavigny paid him a visit the duke used to ask him what he should think if he saw an army of Parisians all fully armed appear at Vincennes to deliver him from prison	162.9554348191744
My lord answered De Chavigny with a low bow I have on the ramparts twenty pieces of artillery and in my casemates thirty thousand guns	201.2714444923912
I should bombard the troops till not one grain of gunpowder was unexploded	646.4200159587143
Yes but after you had fired off your thirty thousand guns they would take the donjon the donjon being taken I should be obliged to let them hang youat which I should be most unhappy certainly	289.1191317576689
And in his turn the duke bowed low to Monsieur de Chavigny	430.12687414247154
For myself on the other hand my lord returned the governor when the first rebel should pass the threshold of my postern doors I should be obliged to kill you with my own hand since you were confided peculiarly to my care and as I am obliged to give you up dead or alive	105.76502840761039
And once more he bowed low before his highness	359.5318250416839
These bittersweet pleasantries lasted ten minutes sometimes longer but always finished thus	545.7801507412964
Monsieur de Chavigny turning toward the door used to call out Halloo La Ramee	294.66793126450784
La Ramee came into the room	2.1753144332673138
La Ramee I recommend Monsieur le Duc to you particularly treat him as a man of his rank and family ought to be treated that is never leave him alone an instant	136.08361525153242
La Ramee became therefore the dukes dinner guest by compulsionan eternal keeper the shadow of his person but La Rameegay frank convivial fond of play a great hand at tennis had one defect in the dukes eyeshis incorruptibility	2133.7744841454623
Now although La Ramee appreciated as of a certain value the honor of being shut up with a prisoner of so great importance still the pleasure of living in intimacy with the grandson of Henry IV	83.09745975778301
hardly compensated for the loss of that which he had experienced in going from time to time to visit his family	45.494913604913805
One may be a jailer or a keeper and at the same time a good father and husband	69.58898646189418
La Ramee adored his wife and children whom now he could only catch a glimpse of from the top of the wall when in order to please him they used to walk on the opposite side of the moat	80.45814576064096
Twas too brief an enjoyment and La Ramee felt that the gayety of heart he had regarded as the cause of health of which it was perhaps rather the result would not long survive such a mode of life	171.23971072226516
He accepted therefore with delight an offer made to him by his friend the steward of the Duc de Grammont to give him a substitute he also spoke of it to Monsieur de Chavigny who promised that he would not oppose it in any waythat is if he approved of the person proposed	115.29273292657238
We consider it useless to draw a physical or moral portrait of Grimaud if as we hope our readers have not wholly forgotten the first part of this work they must have preserved a clear idea of that estimable individual who is wholly unchanged except that he is twenty years older an advance in life that has made him only more silent although since the change that had been working in himself Athos had given Grimaud permission to speak	285.33708353500174
But Grimaud had for twelve or fifteen years preserved habitual silence and a habit of fifteen or twenty years duration becomes second nature	478.110655928403
Grimaud thereupon presented himself with his smooth exterior at the donjon of Vincennes	244.06175305166758
Now Monsieur de Chavigny piqued himself on his infallible penetration for that which almost proved that he was the son of Richelieu was his everlasting pretension he examined attentively the countenance of the applicant for place and fancied that the contracted eyebrows thin lips hooked nose and prominent cheekbones of Grimaud were favorable signs	514.6010282036559
He addressed about twelve words to him Grimaud answered in four	555.4369146396887
Heres a promising fellow and it is I who have found out his merits said Monsieur de Chavigny	142.21767610826888
Go he added and make yourself agreeable to Monsieur la Ramee and tell him that you suit me in all respects	193.12187364854213
Grimaud had every quality that could attract a man on duty who wishes to have a deputy	160.92229443749957
So after a thousand questions which met with only a word in reply La Ramee fascinated by this sobriety in speech rubbed his hands and engaged Grimaud	499.00677515389424
They are these never to leave the prisoner alone to keep away from him every pointed or cutting instrument and to prevent his conversing any length of time with the keepers	309.64929070316543
Good answered Grimaud and he went right to the prisoner	150.55627995395068
The duke was in the act of combing his beard which he had allowed to grow as well as his hair in order to reproach Mazarin with his wretched appearance and condition	138.72313515481864
But having some days previously seen from the top of the donjon Madame de Montbazon pass in her carriage and still cherishing an affection for that beautiful woman he did not wish to be to her what he wished to be to Mazarin and in the hope of seeing her again had asked for a leaden comb which was allowed him	105.46917604249965
The comb was to be a leaden one because his beard like that of most fair people was rather red he therefore dyed it thus whilst combing it	610.7511402751472
As Grimaud entered he saw this comb on the teatable he took it up and as he took it he made a low bow	75.61537336189944
The duke looked at this strange figure with surprise	185.6706170726513
The figure put the comb in its pocket	46.08949283611603
Ho hey what s that cried the duke	94.46755825971574
Grimaud did not answer but bowed a second time	254.94555610187317
Art thou dumb cried the duke	957.9893804748115
Grimaud made a sign that he was not	8.426549973357643
What art thou then Answer I command thee said the duke	162.331099613564
A keeper reiterated the duke there was nothing wanting in my collection except this gallowsbird	427.30754431712444
La Ramee ran in haste to obey the call	147.41523759963434
Who is this wretch who takes my comb and puts it in his pocket asked the duke	146.04802415417083
One of your guards my prince a man of talent and merit whom you will like as I and Monsieur de Chavigny do I am sure	122.05856512054498
Why does he take my comb	68905.71133130633
Why do you take my lords comb asked La Ramee	2721.384704918445
Grimaud drew the comb from his pocket and passing his fingers over the largest teeth pronounced this one word Pointed	164.18832832589888
What does the animal say asked the duke	41.08885291067268
That the king has forbidden your lordship to have any pointed instrument	978.4173941789899
Are you mad La Ramee You yourself gave me this comb	740.5788036251917
I was very wrong my lord for in giving it to you I acted in opposition to my orders	128.85469720818725
The duke looked furiously at Grimaud	45736.93207570361
I perceive that this creature will be my particular aversion he muttered	380.9530875102665
Grimaud nevertheless was resolved for certain reasons not at once to come to a full rupture with the prisoner he wanted to inspire not a sudden repugnance but a good sound steady hatred he retired therefore and gave place to four guards who having breakfasted could attend on the prisoner	331.7795814439059
A fresh practical joke now occurred to the duke	196.56249239242624
He had asked for crawfish for his breakfast on the following morning he intended to pass the day in making a small gallows and hang one of the finest of these fish in the middle of his roomthe red color evidently conveying an allusion to the cardinalso that he might have the pleasure of hanging Mazarin in effigy without being accused of having hung anything more significant than a crawfish	177.73585655552307
The day was employed in preparations for the execution	411.7761178257864
Every one grows childish in prison but the character of Monsieur de Beaufort was particularly disposed to become so	184.46912845927446
In the course of his mornings walk he collected two or three small branches from a tree and found a small piece of broken glass a discovery that quite delighted him	188.52867983620507
When he came home he formed his handkerchief into a loop	255.70844235214958
Nothing of all this escaped Grimaud but La Ramee looked on with the curiosity of a father who thinks that he may perhaps get a cheap idea concerning a new toy for his children	172.37039777100568
The guards looked on it with indifference	198.9817533960784
When everything was ready the gallows hung in the middle of the room the loop made and when the duke had cast a glance upon the plate of crawfish in order to select the finest specimen among them he looked around for his piece of glass it had disappeared	116.82810632844767
Who has taken my piece of glass asked the duke frowning	318.9777847127503
Grimaud made a sign to denote that he had done so	75.43154062324088
What thou again Why didst thou take it	28.31944793229118
Grimaud who held the piece of glass in his hand said Sharp	94.1917286180075
True my lord exclaimed La Ramee	376.3921822012521
Ah deuce take it we have a precious fellow here	309.98857866873374
Monsieur Grimaud said the duke for your sake I beg of you never come within the reach of my fist	83.70519041011302
Hush hush cried La Ramee give me your gibbet my lord	183.13878770866404
I will shape it out for you with my knife	38.97154945117118
And he took the gibbet and shaped it out as neatly as possible	152.20583393014894
That s it said the duke now make me a little hole in the floor whilst I go and fetch the culprit	136.62339717740647
La Ramee knelt down and made a hole in the floor meanwhile the duke hung the crawfish up by a thread	262.17269634882956
Then he placed the gibbet in the middle of the room bursting with laughter	37.58614724122455
La Ramee laughed also and the guards laughed in chorus Grimaud however did not even smile	666.0732700754345
He approached La Ramee and showing him the crawfish hung up by the thread	249.62024934810185
Hung by order of his Highness the Duc de Beaufort cried the prisoner laughing violently and by Master Jacques Chrysostom La Ramee the kings commissioner	690.6937782122088
La Ramee uttered a cry of horror and rushed toward the gibbet which he broke at once and threw the pieces out of the window	44.98702620173693
He was going to throw the crawfish out also when Grimaud snatched it from his hands	450.46975539551545
Good to eat he said and put it in his pocket	39.332790803437284
This scene so enchanted the duke that at the moment he forgave Grimaud for his part in it but on reflection he hated him more and more being convinced he had some evil motive for his conduct	234.07005543710724
But the story of the crab made a great noise through the interior of the donjon and even outside	158.555345265428
Monsieur de Chavigny who at heart detested the cardinal took pains to tell the story to two or three friends who put it into immediate circulation	400.469669334417
The prisoner happened to remark among the guards one man with a very good countenance and he favored this man the more as Grimaud became the more and more odious to him	186.21390398068783
One morning he took this man on one side and had succeeded in speaking to him when Grimaud entered and seeing what was going on approached the duke respectfully but took the guard by the arm	135.72320773296946
You are insupportable cried the duke I shall beat you	134.84400737794115
I will break every bone in your body cried the duke	63.21572222203078
Spy cried the duke more and more enraged I will strangle you with my own hands	90.54694109745016
And he extended his hands toward Grimaud who merely thrust the guard out and shut the door behind him	146.26717783502835
At the same time he felt the dukes arms on his shoulders like two iron claws but instead either of calling out or defending himself he placed his forefinger on his lips and said in a low tone	115.0629616154928
Hush smiling as he uttered the word	87.29553503003316
A gesture a smile and a word from Grimaud all at once were so unusual that his highness stopped short astounded	472.47213569323446
Grimaud took advantage of that instant to draw from his vest a charming little note with an aristocratic seal and presented it to the duke without a word	141.75305919378317
The duke more and more bewildered let Grimaud loose and took the note	797.4447694312212
From Madame de Montbazon he cried	680.0755685877397
The duke tore open the note passed his hands over his eyes for he was dazzled and confused and read	121.84281543656199
My Dear DukeYou may entirely confide in the brave lad who will give you this note he has consented to enter the service of your keeper and to shut himself up at Vincennes with you in order to prepare and assist your escape which we are contriving	158.62362730127293
The moment of your deliverance is at hand have patience and courage and remember that in spite of time and absence all your friends continue to cherish for you the sentiments they have so long professed and truly entertained	257.4435271384042
I sign my full name for I should be vain if I could suppose that after five years of absence you would remember my initials	168.67306758090922
The poor duke became perfectly giddy	54790.54944191836
What for five years he had been wantinga faithful servant a friend a helping handseemed to have fallen from Heaven just when he expected it the least	420.3238414261734
Oh dearest Marie she thinks of me then after five years of separation Heavens there is constancy Then turning to Grimaud he said	238.12800558395924
And thou my brave fellow thou consentest thus to aid me	832.0864810222744
And you have come here with that purpose	111.99764065081918
And I was ready to strangle you cried the duke	372.54707376793135
Wait then said the duke fumbling in his pocket	317.28812377521257
Wait he continued renewing his fruitless search it shall not be said that such devotion to a grandson of Henry IV	263.68535992123026
The dukes endeavors evinced the best intention in the world but one of the precautions taken at Vincennes was that of allowing prisoners to keep no money	178.42139176675045
Whereupon Grimaud observing the dukes disappointment drew from his pocket a purse filled with gold and handed it to him	30.97766130576835
Here is what you are looking for he said	53.3820257806568
The duke opened the purse and wanted to empty it into Grimauds hands but Grimaud shook his head	176.52919955097565
Thank you monseigneur he said drawing back I am paid	459.77371459940673
The duke went from one surprise to another	406.71650881770694
Grimaud drew near and kissed it respectfully	378.1550903125505
The grand manner of Athos had left its mark on Grimaud	318.0765974170041
What shall we do and when and how proceed	1140.9854287597586
It is now eleven answered Grimaud	30678.984659722475
Let my lord at two oclock ask leave to make up a game at tennis with La Ramee and let him send two or three balls over the ramparts	133.51227611094706
Your highness will approach the walls and call out to a man who works in the moat to send them back again	112.70864068102573
Grimaud made a sign that he was going away	14.957206020476258
Ah cried the duke will you not accept any money from me	36.1504042455512
I wish my lord would make me one promise	60.07958076713445
Tis this when we escape together that I shall go everywhere and be always first for if my lord should be overtaken and caught there s every chance of his being brought back to prison whereas if I am caught the least that can befall me is to behung	241.48788345007128
True on my honor as a gentleman it shall be as thou dost suggest	259.6230740703983
Now resumed Grimaud I ve only one thing more to askthat your highness will continue to detest me	218.40672209358266
At this moment La Ramee after the interview we have described with the cardinal entered the room	85.78874801923936
The duke had thrown himself as he was wo nt to do in moments of dullness and vexation on his bed	126.99404768119113
La Ramee cast an inquiring look around him and observing the same signs of antipathy between the prisoner and his guardian he smiled in token of his inward satisfaction	142.56588951205157
Very good my friend very good	15.981921049179382
You have been spoken of in a promising quarter and you will soon I hope have news that will be agreeable to you	99.30924484337935
Grimaud saluted in his politest manner and withdrew as was his custom on the entrance of his superior	101.0511232738065
Well my lord said La Ramee with his rude laugh you still set yourself against this poor fellow	129.27217532232967
So tis you La Ramee in faith tis time you came back again	286.73649940715364
I threw myself on the bed and turned my nose to the wall that I might nt break my promise and strangle Grimaud	201.53976144619884
I doubt however said La Ramee in sprightly allusion to the silence of his subordinate if he has said anything disagreeable to your highness	212.75752201530435
Pardieu you are righta mute from the East I swear it was time for you to come back La Ramee and I was eager to see you again	64.49183094462924
Monseigneur is too good said La Ramee flattered by the compliment	318.753477412742
Yes continued the duke really I feel bored today beyond the power of description	371.87081322802266
Then let us have a match in the tennis court exclaimed La Ramee	523.7026238396433
I am at your service my lord	55.41664178860406
I protest my dear La Ramee said the duke that you are a charming fellow and that I would stay forever at Vincennes to have the pleasure of your society	84.3239653825772
My lord replied La Ramee I think if it depended on the cardinal your wishes would be fulfilled	123.50229535714648
What do you mean Have you seen him lately	186.12960480837765
Really to speak to you about me	52.90596600215456
Of what else do you imagine he would speak to me Really my lord you are his nightmare	231.44823881607388
Ah La Ramee if you would but accept my offers I would make your fortune	115.93127300479219
How you would no sooner have left prison than your goods would be confiscated	337.51960255063835
I shall no sooner be out of prison than I shall be master of Paris	64.88842727125233
Pshaw pshaw I can not hear such things said as that this is a fine conversation with an officer of the king I see my lord I shall be obliged to fetch a second Grimaud	78.68991275270727
Very well let us say no more about it	10.407045655764543
So you and the cardinal have been talking about me La Ramee some day when he sends for you you must let me put on your clothes I will go in your stead I will strangle him and upon my honor if that is made a condition I will return to prison	97.18296087284696
Monseigneur I see well that I must call Grimaud	385.65527301305644
And what did the cuistre pettifogger say about me	1500.620604669778
I admit the word monseigneur because it rhymes with ministre minister	3636.5858377505847
What did he say to me He told me to watch you	83.40434453562315
And why so why watch me asked the duke uneasily	154.50316940873597
Because an astrologer had predicted that you would escape	53.45752317317967
Ah an astrologer predicted that said the duke starting in spite of himself	84.42920942292284
Oh mon Dieu yes those imbeciles of magicians can only imagine things to torment honest people	1348.523348203068
And what did you reply to his most illustrious eminence	231.21597315273775
That if the astrologer in question made almanacs I would advise him not to buy one	395.89209916771813
Because before you could escape you would have to be turned into a bird	70.02595891940891
Let us go and have a game at tennis La Ramee	612.7978012399241
My lordI beg your highnesss pardonbut I must beg for half an hours leave of absence	275.34989124698194
Because Monseigneur Mazarin is a prouder man than his highness though not of such high birth he forgot to ask me to breakfast	147.61311834634296
Well shall I send for some breakfast here	570.3466507439018
No my lord I must tell you that the confectioner who lived opposite the castleDaddy Marteau as they called him	241.31627135453272
Well he sold his business a week ago to a confectioner from Paris an invalid ordered country air for his health	384.40212820504377
Well what have I to do with that	12.533038463898865
Why good Lord this man your highness when he saw me stop before his shop where he has a display of things which would make your mouth water my lord asked me to get him the custom of the prisoners in the donjon	148.73809262867744
I bought said he the business of my predecessor on the strength of his assurance that he supplied the castle whereas on my honor Monsieur de Chavigny though I ve been here a week has not ordered so much as a tartlet	149.09275171653192
But I then replied probably Monsieur de Chavigny is afraid your pastry is not good	318.12075309815714
My pastry not good Well Monsieur La Ramee you shall judge of it yourself and at once	161.8125612417225
I can not I replied it is absolutely necessary for me to return to the chateau	59.84014167332463
Very well said he go and attend to your affairs since you seem to be in a hurry but come back in half an hour	48.24625697394952
In half an hour Yes have you breakfasted Faith no	1780.0826984406124
Well here is a pate that will be ready for you with a bottle of old Burgundy	69.3513343851131
So you see my lord since I am hungry I would with your highnesss leave And La Ramee bent low	493.95292647170857
Go then animal said the duke but remember I only allow you half an hour	104.4958712643732
May I promise your custom to the successor of Father Marteau my lord	281.17257428126544
Yes if he does not put mushrooms in his pies thou knowest that mushrooms from the wood of Vincennes are fatal to my family	1043.9140769510084
La Ramee went out but in five minutes one of the officers of the guard entered in compliance with the strict orders of the cardinal that the prisoner should never be left alone a moment	78.16323217520144
But during these five minutes the duke had had time to read again the note from Madame de Montbazon which proved to the prisoner that his friends were concerting plans for his deliverance but in what way he knew not	158.89582760347866
But his confidence in Grimaud whose petty persecutions he now perceived were only a blind increased and he conceived the highest opinion of his intellect and resolved to trust entirely to his guidance	563.130411220627
Pts made by the Successor of Father Marteau are described	917.985630477116
In half an hour La Ramee returned full of glee like most men who have eaten and more especially drank to their hearts content	361.7531876428033
The pates were excellent the wine delicious	17133.423911633236
The weather was fine and the game at tennis took place in the open air	255.55026208217262
At two oclock the tennis balls began according to Grimauds directions to take the direction of the moat much to the joy of La Ramee who marked fifteen whenever the duke sent a ball into the moat and very soon balls were wanting so many had gone over	236.46344630700787
La Ramee then proposed to send some one to pick them up but the duke remarked that it would be losing time and going near the rampart himself and looking over he saw a man working in one of the numerous little gardens cleared out by the peasants on the opposite side of the moat	132.77996339020447
The man raised his head and the duke was about to utter a cry of surprise	37.33277844055111
The peasant the gardener was Rochefort whom he believed to be in the Bastile	186.40624656133778
Well Who s up there said the man	8.46500588417958
Be so good as to collect and throw us back our balls said the duke	376.2511301295063
The gardener nodded and began to fling up the balls which were picked up by La Ramee and the guard	150.74383775115393
One however fell at the dukes feet and seeing that it was intended for him he put it into his pocket	41.21545324291168
La Ramee was in ecstasies at having beaten a prince of the blood	239.28408275900833
The duke went indoors and retired to bed where he spent indeed the greater part of every day as they had taken his books away	114.36391468971166
La Ramee carried off all his clothes in order to be certain that the duke would not stir	77.40496886542806
However the duke contrived to hide the ball under his bolster and as soon as the door was closed he tore off the cover of the ball with his teeth and found underneath the following letter	70.98556105027023
My LordYour friends are watching over you and the hour of your deliverance is at hand	109.47459784735048
Ask day after tomorrow to have a pie supplied you by the new confectioner opposite the castle and who is no other than Noirmont your former maitre dhotel	367.2615691269333
Do not open the pie till you are alone	42.5116092663673
I hope you will be satisfied with its contents	68.19458350276975
The duke who had latterly been allowed a fire burned the letter but kept the ball and went to bed hiding the ball under his bolster	274.0185859125188
La Ramee entered he smiled kindly on the prisoner for he was an excellent man and had taken a great liking for the captive prince	128.35156892094074
He endeavored to cheer him up in his solitude	43.84722802298387
Ah my friend cried the duke you are so good if I could but do as you do and eat pates and drink Burgundy at the house of Father Marteaus successor	269.23834020779833
Tis true my lord answered La Ramee that his pates are famous and his wine magnificent	718.6041960436103
In any case said the duke his cellar and kitchen might easily excel those of Monsieur de Chavigny	882.7981667461304
Well my lord said La Ramee falling into the trap what is there to prevent your trying them Besides I have promised him your patronage	198.65815525653522
You are right said the duke	540.3573100825224
If I am to remain here permanently as Monsieur Mazarin has kindly given me to understand I must provide myself with a diversion for my old age I must turn gourmand	308.5801929514618
My lord said La Ramee if you will take a bit of good advice do nt put that off till you are old	98.508458796406
Good said the Duc de Beaufort to himself every man in order that he may lose his heart and soul must receive from celestial bounty one of the seven capital sins perhaps two it seems that Master La Ramees is gluttony	352.94773068775
Let us then take advantage of it	8.372698863178181
Well my dear La Ramee the day after tomorrow is a holiday	129.0695657567328
Will you give me a lesson the day after tomorrow	108.0030298369966
Send the guards to take their meal in the canteen of Monsieur de Chavigny well have a supper here under your direction	270.97713824176566
The proposal was seductive but La Ramee was an old stager acquainted with all the traps a prisoner was likely to set	304.96195127252867
Monsieur de Beaufort had said that he had forty ways of getting out of prison	86.09734997029649
Did this proposed breakfast cover some stratagem He reflected but he remembered that he himself would have charge of the food and the wine and therefore that no powder could be mixed with the food no drug with the wine	238.1896906104461
As to getting him drunk the duke could nt hope to do that and he laughed at the mere thought of it	104.85133304957478
Then an idea came to him which harmonized everything	1345.0595046958733
The duke had followed with anxiety La Ramees unspoken soliloquy reading it from point to point upon his face	620.6569250363959
But presently the exempts face suddenly brightened	5317.866037709927
Well he asked that will do will it not	183.23002933529426
Yes my lord on one condition	989.8226516695944
That Grimaud shall wait on us at table	74.83050339088713
Nothing could be more agreeable to the duke however he had presence of mind enough to exclaim	308.01315835006716
To the devil with your Grimaud He will spoil the feast	863.0299967942912
I will direct him to stand behind your chair and since he does nt speak your highness will neither see nor hear him and with a little effort can imagine him a hundred miles away	194.4946570479881
Do you know my friend I find one thing very evident in all this you distrust me	142.52076613531878
My lord the day after tomorrow is Pentecost	592.1916460396158
Well what is Pentecost to me Are you afraid that the Holy Spirit will come as a tongue of fire to open the doors of my prison	91.70101910148631
No my lord but I have already told you what that damned magician predicted	977.2322929137288
That the day of Pentecost would not pass without your highness being out of Vincennes	188.31234550677448
You believe in sorcerers then you fool	1640.559029787975
II mind them no more than that and he snapped his fingers but it is my Lord Giulio who cares about them as an Italian he is superstitious	199.51905628954228
Well then with well acted goodhumor I allow Grimaud but no one else you must manage it all	292.1274460880474
Order whatever you like for supperthe only thing I specify is one of those pies and tell the confectioner that I will promise him my custom if he excels this time in his piesnot only now but when I leave my prison	308.50225902492326
Then you think you will some day leave it said La Ramee	296.3494972995724
The devil replied the prince surely at the death of Mazarin	162.84620414361046
I am fifteen years younger than he is	54.202978604162034
At Vincennes tis true one lives faster	16454.848492462097
My lord replied La Ramee my lord	87.40094299715112
Or dies sooner for it comes to the same thing	37.38506348652301
He stopped however at the door for an instant	31.774559916504334
Whom does your highness wish me to send to you	19.554395262595698
The officer of the guard then with his chessboard	307.4840383812144
Five minutes afterward the officer entered and the duke seemed to be immersed in the sublime combinations of chess	228.58173041536006
A strange thing is the mind and it is wonderful what revolutions may be wrought in it by a sign a word a hope	257.1064554850271
The duke had been five years in prison and now to him looking back upon them those five years which had passed so slowly seemed not so long a time as were the two days the fortyeight hours which still parted him from the time fixed for his escape	119.30393927842435
Besides there was one thing that engaged his most anxious thoughtin what way was the escape to be effected They had told him to hope for it but had not told him what was to be hidden in the mysterious pate	246.91736156627908
And what friends awaited him without He had friends then after five years in prison If that were so he was indeed a highly favored prince	323.6818329460052
He forgot that besides his friends of his own sex a woman strange to say had remembered him	165.63570666756527
It is true that she had not perhaps been scrupulously faithful to him but she had remembered him that was something	133.0807145788895
So the duke had more than enough to think about accordingly he fared at chess as he had fared at tennis he made blunder upon blunder and the officer with whom he played found him easy game	625.2086750393938
But his successive defeats did service to the duke in one waythey killed time for him till eight oclock in the evening then would come night and with night sleep	246.00585329060706
So at least the duke believed but sleep is a capricious fairy and it is precisely when one invokes her presence that she is most likely to keep him waiting	231.152196545415
The duke waited until midnight turning on his mattress like St	1003.0447374496199
Wild dreams had disturbed his repose	13343.823008763457
He dreamed that he was endowed with wingshe wished to fly away	459.3709429502361
For a time these wings supported him but when he reached a certain height this new aid failed him	164.9706265905881
His wings were broken and he seemed to sink into a bottomless abyss whence he awoke bathed in perspiration and nearly as much overcome as if he had really fallen	168.28911024395097
He fell asleep again and another vision appeared	3210.0272040077925
He was in a subterranean passage by which he was to leave Vincennes	174.77531467645292
Grimaud was walking before him with a lantern	32.945864191831035
By degrees the passage narrowed yet the duke continued his course	317.72857720492124
At last it became so narrow that the fugitive tried in vain to proceed	187.52236714355573
The sides of the walls seem to close in even to press against him	312.7476361031026
He made fruitless efforts to go on it was impossible	122.60199788363491
Nevertheless he still saw Grimaud with his lantern in front advancing	149.8808950076892
He wished to call out to him but could not utter a word	46.1773333874485
Then at the other extremity he heard the footsteps of those who were pursuing him	57.67108510151484
These steps came on came fast	57111.16863711496
He was discovered all hope of flight was gone	161.3493677943683
Still the walls seemed to be closing on him they appeared to be in concert with his enemies	113.19143008652108
At last he heard the voice of La Ramee	94.22827554551512
La Ramee took his hand and laughed aloud	715.3041037884473
He was captured again and conducted to the low and vaulted chamber in which Ornano Puylaurens and his uncle had died	607.4659301873731
Their three graves were there rising above the ground and a fourth was also there yawning for its ghastly tenant	497.75361449339283
The duke was obliged to make as many efforts to awake as he had done to go to sleep and La Ramee found him so pale and fatigued that he inquired whether he was ill	146.43995471203507
In fact said one of the guards who had remained in the chamber and had been kept awake by a toothache brought on by the dampness of the atmosphere my lord has had a very restless night and two or three times while dreaming he called for help	109.22915002772649
What is the matter with your highness asked La Ramee	285.8114088898893
Tis your fault you simpleton answered the duke	184.35595015700372
With your idle nonsense yesterday about escaping you worried me so that I dreamed that I was trying to escape and broke my neck in doing so	161.6065109625468
Come he said tis a warning from Heaven	1101.1748195080463
Never commit such an imprudence as to try to escape except in your dreams	99.31249524572212
And you are right my dear La Ramee said the duke wiping away the sweat that stood on his brow wide awake though he was after this I will think of nothing but eating and drinking	150.1505481700581
Hush said La Ramee and one by one he sent away the guards on various pretexts	342.45580230188375
Well asked the duke when they were alone	28.933299824867042
Well replied La Ramee your supper is ordered	150.11819523058477
Ah and what is it to be Monsieur my majordomo will there be a pie	566.2242153536944
I should think so indeedalmost as high as a tower	108.84704841399457
You told him it was for me	68.32359746521072
Yes and he said he would do his best to please your highness	114.42397883403648
Good exclaimed the duke rubbing his hands	2.5745389910783523
Devil take it my lord what a gourmand you are growing I have nt seen you with so cheerful a face these five years	168.32987420476005
The duke saw that he had not controlled himself as he ought but at that moment as if he had listened at the door and comprehended the urgent need of diverting La Ramees ideas Grimaud entered and made a sign to La Ramee that he had something to say to him	132.22905491183317
La Ramee drew near to Grimaud who spoke to him in a low voice	23.97895287737033
The duke meanwhile recovered his selfcontrol	41110.64970485078
I have already forbidden that man he said to come in here without my permission	114.86781352295375
You must pardon him my lord said La Ramee for I directed him to come	139.0658301425831
And why did you so direct when you know that he displeases me	138.46577162637377
My lord will remember that it was agreed between us that he should wait upon us at that famous supper	129.20199502481987
My lord has forgotten the supper	1960.482643565542
No but I have forgotten Monsieur Grimaud	9509.064695148325
My lord understands that there can be no supper unless he is allowed to be present	108.10673968308392
Go on then have it your own way	125.41279790203761
Come here my lad said La Ramee and hear what I have to say	131.04933564436493
Grimaud approached with a very sullen expression on his face	84.40327410328804
La Ramee continued My lord has done me the honor to invite me to a supper tomorrow en teteatete	110.61004454451148
Grimaud made a sign which meant that he did nt see what that had to do with him	56.743406503838145
Yes yes said La Ramee the matter concerns you for you will have the honor to serve us and besides however good an appetite we may have and however great our thirst there will be something left on the plates and in the bottles and that something will be yours	158.88905074181173
And now said La Ramee I must ask your highnesss pardon but it seems that Monsieur de Chavigny is to be away for a few days and he has sent me word that he has certain directions to give me before his departure	94.75687963617207
The duke tried to exchange a glance with Grimaud but there was no glance in Grimauds eyes	202.92976270568818
Go then said the duke and return as soon as possible	37.94440478944238
Does your highness wish to take revenge for the game of tennis yesterday	184.90705288276905
Grimaud intimated by a scarcely perceptible nod that he should consent	448.14168040986357
Yes said the duke but take care my dear La Ramee for I propose to beat you badly	310.0051354240724
Grimaud looked after him and when the door was closed he drew out of his pocket a pencil and a sheet of paper	30.014573213023304
All is ready for tomorrow evening	1434.9559447288427
Keep watch from seven to nine	2182.5425277399877
We shall descend by the first window in the gallery	86.02349295586343
Now my lord give me if you have not lost it the ballthat which contained the letter	102.90978802095705
The duke took it from under his pillow and gave it to Grimaud	167.3382579068917
Well my lord I sew up the paper in the ball and you in your game of tennis will send the ball into the ditch	105.39327954960089
But will it not be lost	617.867664628119
Oh no there will be some one at hand to pick it up	181.37830233488515
Another nod on the part of Grimaud	245.61446584146393
Come now said the duke give some particulars of the plan for our escape	100.47786647500888
That is forbidden me said Grimaud until the last moment	415.27934176507233
Who will be waiting for me beyond the ditch	373.8668693663129
I know nothing about it my lord	107.46077860268792
But at least if you do nt want to see me turn crazy tell what that famous pate will contain	481.5657940137338
Two poniards a knotted rope and a poire dangoisse	776.8649713065441
This poire dangoisse was a famous gag in the form of a pear which being thrust into the mouth by the aid of a spring dilated so as to distend the jaws to their greatest width	233.33032678363423
My lord observes that there will be enough to go around	74.84713749515588
We shall take to ourselves the poniards and the rope replied the duke	301.08931640562764
And make La Ramee eat the pear answered Grimaud	2070.9506853761595
My dear Grimaud thou speakest seldom but when thou dost one must do thee justicethy words are words of gold	601.4813119476283
Whilst these projects were being formed by the Duc de Beaufort and Grimaud the Comte de la Fere and the Vicomte de Bragelonne were entering Paris by the Rue du Faubourg Saint Marcel	55.440233019251956
They stopped at the sign of the Fox in the Rue du Vieux Colombier a tavern known for many years by Athos and asked for two bedrooms	245.0201333658296
You must dress yourself Raoul said Athos I am going to present you to some one	40.14134147559814
Today monsieur asked the young man	1.5447505865531401
Perhaps not being endowed with the endurance of Athos who seemed to be made of iron he would have preferred a bath in the river Seine of which he had heard so much and afterward his bed but the Comte de la Fere had spoken and he had no thought but to obey	88.80032227530384
By the way said Athos take some pains with your toilet Raoul I want you to be approved	215.4106536828239
I hope sir replied the youth smiling that there s no idea of a marriage for me you know of my engagement to Louise	107.90119069752124
Athos in his turn smiled also	3084.819272763279
No do nt be alarmed although it is to a lady that I am going to present you and I am anxious that you should love her	47.53226130068584
The young man looked at the count with a certain uneasiness but at a smile from Athos he was quickly reassured	91.41438044190906
How old is she inquired the Vicomte de Bragelonne	211.72912131899793
My dear Raoul learn once for all that that is a question which is never asked	82.53169573841049
When you can find out a womans age by her face it is useless to ask it when you can not do so it is indiscreet	61.23462378058041
Sixteen years ago she was deemed not only the prettiest but the most graceful woman in France	266.24455256833267
A woman who had been a reigning beauty a year before he was born could not be the subject of any scheme for him	171.8500068071623
When he reappeared Athos received him with the same paternal smile as that which he had often bestowed on DArtagnan but a more profound tenderness for Raoul was now visibly impressed upon his face	157.1711546426339
Athos cast a glance at his feet hands and hairthose three marks of race	275.53397486633884
The youths dark hair was neatly parted and hung in curls forming a sort of dark frame around his face such was the fashion of the day	180.17599895045143
Gloves of gray kid matching the hat well displayed the form of a slender and elegant hand whilst his boots similar in color to the hat and gloves confined feet small as those of a boy twelve years old	233.36897016432744
Come murmured Athos if she is not proud of him she must be hard to please	69.32346479569931
It was three oclock in the afternoon	12.816723437531195
The two travelers proceeded to the Rue Saint Dominique and stopped at the door of a magnificent hotel surmounted with the arms of De Luynes	85.58165547198031
He entered the hotel and ascended the front steps and addressing a footman who waited there in a grand livery asked if the Duchess de Chevreuse was visible and if she could receive the Comte de la Fere	144.32167436098956
The servant returned with a message to say that though the duchess had not the honor of knowing Monsieur de la Fere she would receive him	84.76156644597113
Athos followed the footman who led him through a long succession of apartments and paused at length before a closed door	138.2279444419766
Athos made a sign to the Vicomte de Bragelonne to remain where he was	59.65243708918751
The footman opened the door and announced Monsieur le Comte de la Fere	112.65206754374053
Madame de Chevreuse whose name appears so often in our story The Three Musketeers without her actually having appeared in any scene was still a beautiful woman	337.7026414653698
Although about fortyfour or fortyfive years old she might have passed for thirtyfive	174.42361749013344
She still had her rich fair hair her large animated intelligent eyes so often opened by intrigue so often closed by the blindness of love	276.90164754666085
She had still her nymphlike form so that when her back was turned she still was not unlike the girl who had jumped with Anne of Austria over the moat of the Tuileries in 1563	220.16759355800454
In all other respects she was the same mad creature who threw over her amours such an air of originality as to make them proverbial for eccentricity in her family	201.14976983363357
She was in a little boudoir hung with blue damask adorned by red flowers with a foliage of gold looking upon a garden and reclined upon a sofa her head supported on the rich tapestry which covered it	139.89177898314765
She held a book in her hand and her arm was supported by a cushion	40.904422775059196
At the footmans announcement she raised herself a little and peeped out with some curiosity	181.5447327429693
He was dressed in violettinted velvet trimmed with silk of the same color	178.13086330961747
His shoulderknots were of burnished silver his mantle had no gold nor embroidery on it a simple plume of violet feathers adorned his hat his boots were of black leather and at his girdle hung that sword with a magnificent hilt that Porthos had so often admired in the Rue Feron	275.78128882345015
Splendid lace adorned the falling collar of his shirt and lace fell also over the top of his boots	87.86312492432651
In his whole person he bore such an impress of high degree that Madame de Chevreuse half rose from her seat when she saw him and made him a sign to sit down near her	87.47518838748294
The footman was withdrawing but Athos stopped him by a sign	79.57788785031197
Madame he said to the duchess I have had the boldness to present myself at your hotel without being known to you it has succeeded since you deign to receive me	87.46925202440578
I have now the boldness to ask you for an interview of half an hour	33.9436444774768
I grant it monsieur replied Madame de Chevreuse with her most gracious smile	50.98893417430052
But that is not all madame	1173.451491200775
Oh I am very presuming I am aware	26.632073341912843
The interview for which I ask is of us two alone and I very earnestly wish that it may not be interrupted	176.59555176297766
I am not at home to any one said the Duchess de Chevreuse to the footman	106.05078847039047
There ensued a brief silence during which these two persons who at first sight recognized each other so clearly as of noble race examined each other without embarrassment on either side	167.1047258231183
The duchess was the first to speak	31.288463897531024
Well sir I am waiting with impatience to hear what you wish to say to me	41.163175013433886
And I madame replied Athos am looking with admiration	410.5732698930481
Sir said Madame de Chevreuse you must excuse me but I long to know to whom I am talking	66.26945917844614
You belong to the court doubtless yet I have never seen you at court	85.93061709862
Have you by any chance been in the Bastile	210.0021777387849
No madame I have not but very likely I am on the road to it	88.94350194149537
Ah then tell me who you are and get along with you upon your journey replied the duchess with the gayety which made her so charming for I am sufficiently in bad odor already without compromising myself still more	158.7445458894022
Who I am madame My name has been mentioned to youthe Comte de la Fere you do not know that name	45.85091841083585
I once bore another which you knew but you have certainly forgotten it	108.77160859975531
Formerly said the count I was Athos	1177.2277704690084
The name was not wholly forgotten but mixed up and confused with ancient recollections	391.8972512292567
Athos said she wait a moment	46.57642416316848
And she placed her hands on her brow as if to force the fugitive ideas it contained to concentration in a moment	99.44978439308393
Shall I help you madame asked Athos	299.0230778510346
This Athos was connected with three young musketeers named Porthos DArtagnan and	1374.6230761167728
And Aramis said the duchess quickly	229.13151296477034
And Aramis I see you have not forgotten the name	45.628717180641736
No she said poor Aramis a charming man elegant discreet and a writer of poetical verses	855.0685539892216
I am afraid he has turned out ill she added	290.8797707129069
He has he is an abb	306.4266607462524
Ah what a misfortune exclaimed the duchess playing carelessly with her fan	456.69966742835976
Indeed sir I thank you you have recalled one of the most agreeable recollections of my youth	66.40405106177924
Will you permit me then to recall another to you	100.67615309827578
Faith said Madame de Chevreuse say on	1070.3473761658431
With a man like you I fear nothing	147.31349422909932
Aramis he continued was intimate with a young needlewoman from Tours a cousin of his named Marie Michon	743.482376276589
Ah I knew her cried the duchess	210.50732379026417
It was to her he wrote from the siege of Rochelle to warn her of a plot against the Duke of Buckingham	142.3684211546925
Exactly so will you allow me to speak to you of her	14.018331122056734
If replied the duchess with a meaning look you do not say too much against her	55.015982100759516
I should be ungrateful said Athos and I regard ingratitude not as a fault or a crime but as a vice which is much worse	281.5740853640678
You ungrateful to Marie Michon monsieur said Madame de Chevreuse trying to read in Athoss eyes	170.65808162033113
But how can that be You never knew her	706.9981178243156
Eh madame who knows said Athos	3756.7335509921277
There is a popular proverb to the effect that it is only mountains that never meet and popular proverbs contain sometimes a wonderful amount of truth	609.3892942238301
Oh go on monsieur go on said Madame de Chevreuse eagerly you ca nt imagine how much this conversation interests me	128.41503274485396
You encourage me said Athos I will continue then	67.12100354613652
That cousin of Aramis that Marie Michon that needlewoman notwithstanding her low condition had acquaintances in the highest rank she called the grandest ladies of the court her friend and the queenproud as she is in her double character as Austrian and as Spaniardcalled her her sister	516.1648277378589
Alas said Madame de Chevreuse with a slight sigh and a little movement of her eyebrows that was peculiarly her own since that time everything has changed	114.94819049121556
And the queen had reason for her affection for Marie was devoted to herdevoted to that degree that she served her as medium of intercourse with her brother the king of Spain	263.2696899004959
Which interrupted the duchess is now brought up against her as a great crime	176.03157516117165
And therefore continued Athos the cardinalthe true cardinal the other onedetermined one fine morning to arrest poor Marie Michon and send her to the Chateau de Loches	658.0556684793501
Fortunately the affair was not managed so secretly but that it became known to the queen	213.98384624734078
The case had been provided for if Marie Michon should be threatened with any danger the queen was to send her a prayerbook bound in green velvet	339.6793794486804
That is true monsieur you are well informed	43.019527416085865
One morning the green book was brought to her by the Prince de Marsillac	72.37073406091852
There was no time to lose	15.901928505742488
Happily Marie and a follower of hers named Kitty could disguise themselves admirably in mens clothes	1479.3475706130118
The prince procured for Marie Michon the dress of a cavalier and for Kitty that of a lackey he sent them two excellent horses and the fugitives went out hastily from Tours shaping their course toward Spain trembling at the least noise following unfrequented roads and asking for hospitality when they found themselves where there was no inn	421.50218044082004
Why really it was all exactly as you say cried Madame de Chevreuse clapping her hands	210.44317737788356
It would indeed be strange if she checked herself	366.05697720052314
If I should follow the two fugitives to the end of their journey said Athos	108.02275020850217
No madame I will not thus waste your time	398.80538243907114
We will accompany them only to a little village in Limousin lying between Tulle and Angoulemea little village called RochelAbeille	1582.2386140991807
Madame de Chevreuse uttered a cry of surprise and looked at Athos with an expression of astonishment that made the old musketeer smile	72.20333712853036
Wait madame continued Athos what remains for me to tell you is even more strange than what I have narrated	96.78956553621282
Monsieur said Madame de Chevreuse I believe you are a sorcerer I am prepared for anything	68.18455991592215
The journey of that day had been long and wearing it was a cold day the eleventh of October there was no inn or chateau in the village and the homes of the peasants were poor and unattractive	167.8583626814121
Marie Michon was a very aristocratic person like her sister the queen she had been accustomed to pleasing perfumes and fine linen she resolved therefore to seek hospitality of the priest	226.7800708232978
I have told you that I am prepared for anything	43.291586426284226
The two travelers knocked at the door	2.265555432569056
It was late the priest who had gone to bed cried out to them to come in	59.97791125192414
They entered for the door was not lockedthere is much confidence among villagers	1725.6308127592479
A lamp burned in the chamber occupied by the priest	70.82671691799523
Marie Michon who made the most charming cavalier in the world pushed open the door put her head in and asked for hospitality	107.9270001540933
Willingly my young cavalier said the priest if you will be content with the remains of my supper and with half my chamber	71.66898204385716
The two travelers consulted for a moment	7.713271408239072
The priest heard a burst of laughter and then the master or rather the mistress replied Thank you monsieur le cur I accept	173.89562335987503
Sup then and make as little noise as possible said the priest for I too have been on the go all day and shall not be sorry to sleep tonight	93.32563532327116
Madame de Chevreuse evidently went from surprise to astonishment and from astonishment to stupefaction	475.5573294482324
Her face as she looked at Athos had taken on an expression that can not be described	141.65450161206496
It could be seen that she had wished to speak but she had remained silent through fear of losing one of her companions words	74.42161161440305
Ah I have come now to what is most difficult	138.8290503124387
Speak speak One can say anything to me	16.112362455639683
Besides it does nt concern me it relates to Mademoiselle Marie Michon	703.022258029227
Ah that is true said Athos	4109.302899391062
Well then Marie Michon had supper with her follower and then in accordance with the permission given her she entered the chamber of her host Kitty meanwhile taking possession of an armchair in the room first entered where they had taken their supper	174.20929387874668
Really monsieur said Madame de Chevreuse unless you are the devil in person I do nt know how you could become acquainted with all these details	76.05140506538754
A charming woman was that Marie Michon resumed Athos one of those wild creatures who are constantly conceiving the strangest ideas	606.6621018866086
Now thinking that her host was a priest that coquette took it into her head that it would be a happy souvenir for her old age among the many happy souvenirs she already possessed if she could win that of having damned an abb	266.66577355820823
Count said the duchess upon my word you frighten me	149.85551263766203
Alas continued Athos the poor abb was not a St	83.41288990437555
Ambroise and I repeat Marie Michon was an adorable creature	233.63101892687237
Monsieur cried the duchess seizing Athoss hands tell me this moment how you know all these details or I will send to the convent of the Vieux Augustins for a monk to come and exorcise you	162.4558592362683
A cavalier charged with an important mission had come an hour before your arrival seeking hospitality at the very moment that the cur summoned to the bedside of a dying person left not only his house but the village for the entire night	160.88397592936008
The priest having all confidence in his guest who besides was a nobleman had left to him his house his supper and his chamber	101.29580423964079
And therefore Marie came seeking hospitality from the guest of the good abb and not from the good abb himself	117.90603242938553
And that cavalier that guest that nobleman who arrived before she came	357.8465765495833
It was I the Comte de la Fere said Athos rising and bowing respectfully to the Duchess de Chevreuse	97.17043503544932
The duchess remained a moment stupefied then suddenly bursting into laughter	944.0287537021803
Ah upon my word said she it is very droll and that mad Marie Michon fared better than she expected	362.0078266606718
Sit down dear count and go on with your story	89.21389885907327
At this point I have to accuse myself of a fault madame	180.5316965697303
I have told you that I was traveling on an important mission	255.68004845446043
At daybreak I left the chamber without noise leaving my charming companion asleep	689.6209993843185
In the front room the follower was also still asleep her head leaning back on the chair in all respects worthy of her mistress	273.0345502523558
Her pretty face arrested my attention I approached and recognized that little Kitty whom our friend Aramis had placed with her	352.73586254730253
In that way I discovered that the charming traveler was	292.1638869065218
Marie Michon said Madame de Chevreuse hastily	5406.697045098269
Then I went out of the house I proceeded to the stable and found my horse saddled and my lackey ready	165.253495330073
We set forth on our journey	26.18772362831873
And have you never revisited that village eagerly asked Madame de Chevreuse	397.894409033045
I wanted to see the good cur again	3342.7050373824286
I found him much preoccupied with an event that he could not at all comprehend	75.62492127210405
A week before he had received in a cradle a beautiful little boy three months old with a purse filled with gold and a note containing these simple words 11 October 1633	260.71326774467747
It was the date of that strange adventure interrupted Madame de Chevreuse	257.9949389998924
Yes but he could nt understand what it meant for he had spent that night with a dying person and Marie Michon had left his house before his return	110.36860815351783
You must know monsieur that Marie Michon when she returned to France in 1643 immediately sought for information about that child as a fugitive she could not take care of it but on her return she wished to have it near her	178.87043891111702
And what said the abb asked Athos	559.136752574691
That a nobleman whom he did not know had wished to take charge of it had answered for its future and had taken it away	77.54970604957299
Ah I see That nobleman was you it was his father	112.8690073458002
Hush do not speak so loud madame he is there	124.24709702504005
He is there my son the son of Marie Michon But I must see him instantly	128.68719717184572
Take care madame said Athos for he knows neither his father nor his mother	81.36021027359145
You have kept the secret you have brought him to see me thinking to make me happy	50.58408960241109
Oh thanks sir thanks cried Madame de Chevreuse seizing his hand and trying to put it to her lips you have a noble heart	52.031468299537565
I bring him to you madame said Athos withdrawing his hand hoping that in your turn you will do something for him till now I have watched over his education and I have made him I hope an accomplished gentleman but I am now obliged to return to the dangerous and wandering life of party faction	139.73509750327577
Tomorrow I plunge into an adventurous affair in which I may be killed	112.01675224042465
Then it will devolve on you to push him on in that world where he is called on to occupy a place	99.43385767305692
Rest assured cried the duchess I shall do what I can	23.107087325317508
I have but little influence now but all that I have shall most assuredly be his	186.99267714721285
As to his title and fortune	7963.714031049705
As to that madame I have made over to him the estate of Bragelonne my inheritance which will give him ten thousand francs a year and the title of vicomte	98.01912635393656
Upon my soul monsieur said the duchess you are a true nobleman But I am eager to see our young vicomte	116.7501294862748
I will have him come in if you really wish it	162.81515919212404
Athos moved toward the door the duchess held him back	117.60594223177735
So he opened the door and beckoned the young man in	54.78894779163404
The duchess could not restrain a cry of joy on seeing so handsome a young cavalier so far surpassing all that her maternal pride had been able to conceive	108.65498345693108
Vicomte come here said Athos the duchess permits you to kiss her hand	259.68129657388687
The youth approached with his charming smile and his head bare and kneeling down kissed the hand of the Duchess de Chevreuse	95.40147123779171
Sir he said turning to Athos was it not in compassion to my timidity that you told me that this lady was the Duchess de Chevreuse and is she not the queen	176.60863605764453
No vicomte said Madame de Chevreuse taking his hand and making him sit near her while she looked at him with eyes sparkling with pleasure no unhappily I am not the queen	119.93287565684447
If I were I should do for you at once the most that you deserve	73.96611143151657
But let us see whatever I may be she added hardly restraining herself from kissing that pure brow let us see what profession you wish to follow	289.75323363247327
Athos standing looked at them both with indescribable pleasure	196.55602524609765
Madame answered the youth in his sweet voice it seems to me that there is only one career for a gentlemanthat of the army	87.93214103389128
I have been brought up by monsieur le comte with the intention I believe of making me a soldier and he gave me reason to hope that at Paris he would present me to some one who would recommend me to the favor of the prince	87.33472101844114
Personally I am on bad terms with him on account of the quarrels between Madame de Montbazon my motherinlaw and Madame de Longueville	102.08819527302516
But the Prince de Marsillac Yes indeed that s the right thing	174.0783472559197
The Prince de Marsillacmy old friendwill recommend our young friend to Madame de Longueville who will give him a letter to her brother the prince who loves her too tenderly not to do what she wishes immediately	107.80244550381282
Well that will do charmingly said the count but may I beg that the greatest haste may be made for I have reasons for wishing the vicomte not to sleep longer than tomorrow night in Paris	150.0497983080376
Do you wish it known that you are interested about him monsieur le comte	100.95299019459414
Better for him in future that he should be supposed never to have seen me	46.7383703894841
You know Bragelonne said Athos I never speak without reflection	379.2439568725862
Well comte I am going instantly interrupted the duchess to send for the Prince de Marsillac who is happily in Paris just now	187.54866894912584
What are you going to do this evening	35.46653754594595
We intend to visit the Abb Scarron for whom I have a letter of introduction and at whose house I expect to meet some of my friends	103.97406691742407
Tis well I will go there also for a few minutes said the duchess do not quit his salon until you have seen me	65.53480698785437
Athos bowed and prepared to leave	65.38738322575885
Well monsieur le comte said the duchess smiling does one leave so solemnly his old friends	447.54741186893955
Ah murmured Athos kissing her hand had I only sooner known that Marie Michon was so charming a creature And he withdrew sighing	381.4543297553719
There was once in the Rue des Tournelles a house known by all the sedan chairmen and footmen of Paris and yet nevertheless this house was neither that of a great lord nor of a rich man	186.18351165010168
There was neither dining nor playing at cards nor dancing in that house	366.56716442091596
Nevertheless it was the rendezvous of the great world and all Paris went there	92.49539471294653
It was the abode of the little Abb Scarron	619.7130377872455
In the home of the witty abb dwelt incessant laughter there all the items of the day had their source and were so quickly transformed misrepresented metamorphosed some into epigrams some into falsehoods that every one was anxious to pass an hour with little Scarron listening to what he said reporting it to others	627.4125205241481
The diminutive Abb Scarron who however was an abb only because he owned an abbey and not because he was in orders had formerly been one of the gayest prebendaries in the town of Mans which he inhabited	242.32742844564066
On a day of the carnival he had taken a notion to provide an unusual entertainment for that good town of which he was the life and soul	239.4377199661175
He had made his valet cover him with honey then opening a feather bed he had rolled in it and had thus become the most grotesque fowl it is possible to imagine	269.87752440948856
He then began to visit his friends of both sexes in that strange costume	219.95756843290874
At first he had been followed through astonishment then with derisive shouts then the porters had insulted him then children had thrown stones at him and finally he was obliged to run to escape the missiles	352.99181081899377
As soon as he took to flight every one pursued him until pressed on all sides Scarron found no way of escaping his escort except by throwing himself into the river but the water was icy cold	266.5478999491034
Scarron was heated the cold seized on him and when he reached the farther bank he found himself crippled	95.57409068773532
Every means had been employed in vain to restore the use of his limbs	50.97437631421206
He had been subjected to a severe disciplinary course of medicine at length he sent away all his doctors declaring that he preferred the disease to the treatment and came to Paris where the fame of his wit had preceded him	227.96561390708723
There he had a chair made on his own plan and one day visiting Anne of Austria in this chair she asked him charmed as she was with his wit if he did not wish for a title	79.0688939504594
Yes your majesty there is a title which I covet much replied Scarron	714.651333361963
That of being your invalid answered Scarron	16929.784695164864
So he was called the queens invalid with a pension of fifteen hundred francs	176.26202718890036
From that lucky moment Scarron led a happy life spending both income and principal	1696.9524435881174
One day however an emissary of the cardinals gave him to understand that he was wrong in receiving the coadjutor so often	110.54589500364047
And why asked Scarron is he not a man of good birth	45.84647475762514
He has unfortunately too much wit	8967.038370129947
Well then why do you wish me to give up seeing such a man	67.18700701982723
What answered Scarron I continue to receive Monsieur Gilles Despreaux who thinks ill of me and you wish me to give up seeing the coadjutor because he thinks ill of another man	303.1854661743516
The conversation had rested there and Scarron through sheer obstinacy had seen Monsieur de Gondy only the more frequently	1000.3620212386191
Now the very morning of which we speak was that of his quarterday payment and Scarron as usual had sent his servant to get his money at the pensionoffice but the man had returned and said that the government had no more money to give Monsieur Scarron	192.0351166896969
It was on Thursday the abbs reception day people went there in crowds	4398.391116554661
The cardinals refusal to pay the pension was known about the town in half an hour and he was abused with wit and vehemence	147.04945671470006
In the Rue Saint Honore Athos fell in with two gentlemen whom he did not know on horseback like himself followed by a lackey like himself and going in the same direction that he was	95.5561067027616
One of them hat in hand said to him	48.39189320847035
Would you believe it monsieur that contemptible Mazarin has stopped poor Scarrons pension	5374.248694180613
That is unreasonable said Athos saluting in his turn the two cavaliers	92.3918400617433
And they separated with courteous gestures	34178.20545300925
It happens well that we are going there this evening said Athos to the vicomte we will pay our compliments to that poor man	69.93877559334139
What then is this Monsieur Scarron who thus puts all Paris in commotion Is he some minister out of office	833.0309219232875
Oh no not at all vicomte Athos replied he is simply a gentleman of great genius who has fallen into disgrace with the cardinal through having written certain verses against him	427.9203762725759
Do gentlemen then make verses asked Raoul naively I thought it was derogatory	460.8017417937678
So it is my dear vicomte said Athos laughing to make bad ones but to make good ones increases famewitness Monsieur de Rotrou	524.6455158683414
Nevertheless he continued in the tone of one who gives wholesome advice I think it is better not to make them	94.56013267586472
Then said Raoul this Monsieur Scarron is a poet	424.6305105060552
Consider well what you do in that house	46.630565033534516
Talk only by gestures or rather always listen	552.3358986975358
You will see me talking with one of my friends the Abb dHerblay of whom you have often heard me speak	48.323075053445926
Come near to us from time to time as if to speak but do not speak and do not listen	44.86959212881605
That little stratagem may serve to keep off interlopers	1047.59976907832
Very well monsieur I will obey you at all points	105.79789906125562
Athos made two visits in Paris at seven oclock he and Raoul directed their steps to the Rue des Tournelles it was stopped by porters horses and footmen	123.73497180325236
Athos forced his way through and entered followed by the young man	36.23498299522159
The first person that struck him on his entrance was Aramis planted near a great chair on castors very large covered with a canopy of tapestry under which there moved enveloped in a quilt of brocade a little face youngish very merry somewhat pallid whilst its eyes never ceased to express a sentiment at once lively intellectual and amiable	531.6303478652786
This was the Abb Scarron always laughing joking complimentingyet sufferingand toying nervously with a small switch	7378.648962558146
Around this kind of rolling tent pressed a crowd of gentlemen and ladies	532.5044501096776
The room was neatly comfortably furnished	4297.40864336606
Large valances of silk embroidered with flowers of gay colors which were rather faded fell from the wide windows the fittings of the room were simple but in excellent taste	161.92755873576016
Two well trained servingmen were in attendance on the company	149.57204626549725
On perceiving Athos Aramis advanced toward him took him by the hand and presented him to Scarron	66.85959520583846
Raoul remained silent for he was not prepared for the dignity of the bel esprit	129.4003724216579
After some minutes the door opened and a footman announced Mademoiselle Paulet	306.7632976080119
Athos touched the shoulder of the vicomte	352.0529432992568
Look at this lady Raoul she is an historic personage it was to visit her King Henry IV	341.65529345617557
was going when he was assassinated	2746.8891569996727
Every one thronged around Mademoiselle Paulet for she was always very much the fashion	391.1188762789993
She was a tall woman with a slender figure and a forest of golden curls such as Raphael was fond of and Titian has painted all his Magdalens with	284.58903421579527
This fawncolored hair or perhaps the sort of ascendancy which she had over other women gave her the name of La Lionne	204.36521359626963
Mademoiselle Paulet took her accustomed seat but before sitting down she cast in all her queenlike grandeur a look around the room and her eyes rested on Raoul	227.09046050655033
Mademoiselle Paulet has observed you vicomte go and bow to her do nt try to appear anything but what you are a true country youth on no account speak to her of Henry IV	184.5655306698895
When shall we two walk together Athos then said to Aramis	258.28847203452807
Presentlythere are not a sufficient number of people here yet we shall be remarked	183.25176413229946
At this moment the door opened and in walked the coadjutor	125.9021988641503
At this name every one looked around for his was already a very celebrated name	312.70923735723113
He knew the Abb de Gondy only by report	462.60215303179206
He saw a little dark man ill made and awkward with his hands in everythingexcept drawing a sword and firing a pistolwith something haughty and contemptuous in his face	567.4871122428304
Scarron turned around toward him and came to meet him in his chair	24.036831793897587
Well said the coadjutor on seeing him you are in disgrace then abb	374.9803610730342
It had been said that evening a hundred timesand Scarron was at his hundredth bon mot on the subject he was very nearly at the end of his humoristic tether but one despairing effort saved him	413.55789508694255
Monsieur the Cardinal Mazarin has been so kind as to think of me he said	27.892997545521446
But how can you continue to receive us asked the coadjutor if your income is lessened I shall be obliged to make you a canon of Notre Dame	101.78146786798264
Oh no cried Scarron I should compromise you too much	146.758064312982
Perhaps you have resources of which we are ignorant	98.51631020275867
I shall borrow from the queen	2184.299965858739
But her majesty has no property interposed Aramis	9704.817030550468
At this moment the door opened and Madame de Chevreuse was announced	28.833487051241722
Scarron turned his chair toward the door Raoul blushed Athos made a sign to Aramis who went and hid himself in the enclosure of a window	111.83666692160953
In the midst of all the compliments that awaited her on her entrance the duchess seemed to be looking for some one at last she found out Raoul and her eyes sparkled she perceived Athos and became thoughtful she saw Aramis in the seclusion of the window and gave a start of surprise behind her fan	203.75818412875475
Apropos she said as if to drive away thoughts that pursued her in spite of herself how is poor Voiture do you know Scarron	327.2650660492883
What is Monsieur Voiture ill inquired a gentleman who had spoken to Athos in the Rue Saint Honore what is the matter with him	60.33420661061839
He was acting but forgot to take the precaution to have a change of linen ready after the performance said the coadjutor so he took cold and is about to die	142.18392275283938
Is he then so ill dear Voiture asked Aramis half hidden by the window curtain	486.8336471279361
Die cried Mademoiselle Paulet bitterly he Why he is surrounded by sultanas like a Turk	456.1105988855989
Madame de Saintot has hastened to him with broth La Renaudot warms his sheets the Marquise de Rambouillet sends him his tisanes	972.5642407212499
You do nt like him my dear Parthenie said Scarron	625.8384250255476
What an injustice my dear invalid I hate him so little that I should be delighted to order masses for the repose of his soul	121.46888658057847
You are not called Lionne for nothing observed Madame de Chevreuse your teeth are terrible	494.8851345171103
You are unjust to a great poet it seems to me Raoul ventured to say	272.8106742052311
A great poet come one may easily see vicomte that you are lately from the provinces and have never so much as seen him	268.49032294852844
A great poet he is scarcely five feet high	674.3422677949985
Bravo bravo cried a tall man with an enormous mustache and a long rapier bravo fair Paulet it is high time to put little Voiture in his right place	387.34068288342803
For my part I always thought his poetry detestable and I think I know something about poetry	399.196744210396
Who is this officer inquired Raoul of Athos who is speaking	211.42569449595024
Monsieur de Scudery the author of Clelie and of Le Grand Cyrus which were composed partly by him and partly by his sister who is now talking to that pretty person yonder near Monsieur Scarron	376.308372419566
Raoul turned and saw two faces just arrived	769.5712120554869
One was perfectly charming delicate pensive shaded by beautiful dark hair and eyes soft as velvet like those lovely flowers the heartsease in which shine out the golden petals	383.1071562266322
The other of mature age seemed to have the former one under her charge and was cold dry and yellowthe true type of a duenna or a devotee	383.06209266535575
Raoul resolved not to quit the room without having spoken to the beautiful girl with the soft eyes who by a strange fancy although she bore no resemblance reminded him of his poor little Louise whom he had left in the Chateau de la Valliere and whom in the midst of all the party he had never for one moment quite forgotten	93.72805857097507
Meantime Aramis had drawn near to the coadjutor who smiling all the while contrived to drop some words into his ear	155.42572576623485
Aramis notwithstanding his selfcontrol could not refrain from a slight movement of surprise	34.342553885218805
Laugh then said Monsieur de Retz they are looking at us	227.5895526783522
And leaving Aramis he went to talk with Madame de Chevreuse who was in the midst of a large group	38.48753621972588
Aramis affected a laugh to divert the attention of certain curious listeners and perceiving that Athos had betaken himself to the embrasure of a window and remained there he proceeded to join him throwing out a few words carelessly as he moved through the room	132.80625888955237
As soon as the two friends met they began a conversation which was emphasized by frequent gesticulation	495.10472870685913
Raoul then approached them as Athos had directed him to do	103.09215491213162
Tis a rondeau by Monsieur Voiture that monsieur labb is repeating to me	711.3066242269647
said Athos in a loud voice and I confess I think it incomparable	138.15677576926586
Raoul stayed only a few minutes near them and then mingled with the group round Madame de Chevreuse	114.62550599116554
Well then asked Athos in a low tone	4.256267277153473
It is to be tomorrow said Aramis hastily	651.8719496777335
And then philosophic ideas are wholly wanting in Voitures works but I am of the same opinion as the coadjutorhe is a poet a true poet	262.5561557216269
Aramis spoke so as to be heard by everybody	74.86218229831762
And I too murmured the young lady with the velvet eyes	39.78606403353911
I have the misfortune also to admire his poetry exceedingly	1412.1672490508029
Monsieur Scarron do me the honor said Raoul blushing to tell me the name of that young lady whose opinion seems so different from that of others of the company	112.13504091326989
Ah my young vicomte replied Scarron I suppose you wish to propose to her an alliance offensive and defensive	356.66400206970536
You asked the name of that young lady	62.52323081171993
She is called the fair Indian	9867.054265337043
Excuse me sir returned Raoul blushing still more deeply I know no more than I did before	84.27697695537205
Alas I am from the country	940.7292466549176
Which means that you know very little about the nonsense which here flows down our streets	642.6027401648815
So much the better young man so much the better Do nt try to understand ityou will only lose your time	100.47391434643927
You forgive me then sir said Raoul and you will deign to tell me who is the person that you call the young Indian	83.3502070881009
Certainly one of the most charming persons that livesMademoiselle Frances dAubigne	6870.209576367054
Does she belong to the family of the celebrated Agrippa the friend of Henry IV	213.33642320234364
She comes from Martinique so I call her the beautiful Indian	365.6873951811032
Raoul looked surprised and his eyes met those of the young lady who smiled	36.3705277145843
The company went on speaking of the poet Voiture	907.5279077679112
Monsieur said Mademoiselle dAubigne to Scarron as if she wished to join in the conversation he was engaged in with Raoul do you not admire Monsieur Voitures friends Listen how they pull him to pieces even whilst they praise him one takes away from him all claim to good sense another robs him of his poetry a third of his originality another of his humor another of his independence of character a sixthbut good heavens what will they leave him as Mademoiselle de Scudery remarks	390.2691435105093
The fair Indian astonished at the sensation her observation produced looked down and resumed her air of naivete	947.6452210121677
Athos still within the inclosure of the window watched this scene with a smile of disdain on his lips	30.138635394434605
Tell the Comte de la Fere to come to me said Madame de Chevreuse I want to speak to him	37.355084953258725
And I said the coadjutor want it to be thought that I do not speak to him	49.55691793589053
I admire I love himfor I know his former adventuresbut I shall not speak to him until the day after tomorrow	73.84928036421279
And why day after tomorrow asked Madame de Chevreuse	51.10013643016289
You will know that tomorrow evening said the coadjutor smiling	129.7539448436449
Really my dear Gondy said the duchess you remind one of the Apocalypse	223.14660050683247
Monsieur dHerblay she added turning toward Aramis will you be my servant once more this evening	368.3023306215581
How can you doubt it replied Aramis this evening tomorrow always command me	719.3594859325993
Go and look for the Comte de la Fere I wish to speak with him	22.984435195649443
Aramis found Athos and brought him	4.339810388876651
Monsieur le comte said the duchess giving him a letter here is what I promised you our young friend will be extremely well received	117.20870307300835
Madame he is very happy in owing any obligation to you	200.72128711535652
You have no reason to envy him on that score for I owe to you the pleasure of knowing him replied the witty woman with a smile which recalled Marie Michon to Aramis and to Athos	169.16429603929768
As she uttered that bon mot she arose and asked for her carriage	128.80877477492186
Mademoiselle Paulet had already gone Mademoiselle de Scudery was going	633.302348754542
Vicomte said Athos to Raoul follow the duchess beg her to do you the favor to take your arm in going downstairs and thank her as you descend	145.25493834612885
You are going already he said	3.84831315810935
One of the last as you see if you hear anything of Monsieur Voiture be so kind as to send me word tomorrow	95.89725810271723
Oh said Scarron he may die now	140.29204719150877
Why asked the young girl with the velvet eyes	43.10404310748169
Certainly his panegyric has been uttered	2048.379960962857
They parted laughing she turning back to gaze at the poor paralytic man with interest he looking after her with eyes of love	152.02668587151626
One by one the several groups broke up	1677.8590677395387
Scarron seemed not to observe that certain of his guests had talked mysteriously that letters had passed from hand to hand and that the assembly had seemed to have a secret purpose quite apart from the literary discussion carried on with so much ostentation	208.46191389109185
What was all that to Scarron At his house rebellion could be planned with impunity for as we have said since that morning he had ceased to be the queens invalid	240.99400081421976
As to Raoul he had attended the duchess to her carriage where as she took her seat she gave him her hand to kiss then by one of those wild caprices which made her so adorable and at the same time so dangerous she had suddenly put her arm around his neck and kissed his forehead saying	80.67272824481697
Vicomte may my good wishes and this kiss bring you good fortune	224.6514101794295
Then she had pushed him away and directed the coachman to stop at the Hotel de Luynes	122.46509320710734
The carriage had started Madame de Chevreuse had made a parting gesture to the young man and Raoul had returned in a state of stupefaction	49.114029102665675
Athos surmised what had taken place and smiled	67.64944677388674
Come vicomte he said it is time for you to go to bed you will start in the morning for the army of monsieur le prince	51.22183166412185
Sleep well your last night as citizen	3855.953403087475
I am to be a soldier then said the young man	25.422521880494614
Oh monsieur I thank you with all my heart	17.356250586418497
Adieu count said the Abb dHerblay I return to my convent	209.79284593564375
Adieu abb said the coadjutor I am to preach tomorrow and have twenty texts to examine this evening	219.9340384861561
Adieu gentlemen said the count I am going to sleep twentyfour hours I am just falling down with fatigue	124.56769210869065
The three men saluted one another whilst exchanging a last look	561.0856467418324
Scarron followed their movements with a glance from the corner of his eye	30.019992458267684
Not one of them will do as he says he murmured with his little monkey smile but they may do as they please the brave gentlemen Who knows if they will not manage to restore to me my pension They can move their arms they can and that is much	173.4732850653577
Alas I have only my tongue but I will try to show that it is good for something	58.437133466785035
Ho there Champenois here it is eleven oclock	47.023295981419864
Come and roll me to bed	226.20864186566473
Really that Demoiselle dAubigne is very charming	212.60511225925487
So the invalid disappeared soon afterward and went into his sleepingroom and one by one the lights in the salon of the Rue des Tournelles were extinguished	123.84810670532121
The day had begun to break when Athos arose and dressed himself	445.7486763148721
It was plain by a paleness still greater than usual and by those traces which loss of sleep leaves on the face that he must have passed almost the whole of the night without sleeping	168.27138713256312
Contrary to the custom of a man so firm and decided there was this morning in his personal appearance something tardy and irresolute	251.34425515156212
He was occupied with the preparations for Raouls departure and was seeking to gain time	309.7222010409928
In the first place he himself furbished a sword which he drew from its perfumed leather sheath he examined it to see if its hilt was well guarded and if the blade was firmly attached to the hilt	227.7259960695041
Then he placed at the bottom of the valise belonging to the young man a small bag of louis called Olivain the lackey who had followed him from Blois and made him pack the valise under his own eyes watchful to see that everything should be put in which might be useful to a young man entering on his first campaign	139.76411131581318
At length after occupying about an hour in these preparations he opened the door of the room in which the vicomte slept and entered	43.74363383795287
The sun already high penetrated into the room through the window the curtains of which Raoul had neglected to close on the previous evening	58.75798613336598
He was still sleeping his head gracefully reposing on his arm	230.03552032094657
Athos approached and hung over the youth in an attitude full of tender melancholy he looked long on this young man whose smiling mouth and half closed eyes bespoke soft dreams and lightest slumber as if his guardian angel watched over him with solicitude and affection	271.0618054660093
By degrees Athos gave himself up to the charms of his reverie in the proximity of youth so pure so fresh	123.37656696713643
His own youth seemed to reappear bringing with it all those savoury remembrances which are like perfumes more than thoughts	754.0238715918506
Between the past and the present was an ineffable abyss	660.5201557468368
But imagination has the wings of an angel of light and travels safely through or over the seas where we have been almost shipwrecked the darkness in which our illusions are lost the precipice whence our happiness has been hurled and swallowed up	274.9691008275336
He remembered that all the first part of his life had been embittered by a woman and he thought with alarm of the influence love might assume over so fine and at the same time so vigorous an organization as that of Raoul	123.68827196169171
In recalling all he had been through he foresaw all that Raoul might suffer and the expression of the deep and tender compassion which throbbed in his heart was pictured in the moist eye with which he gazed on the young man	158.02158266506413
At this moment Raoul awoke without a cloud on his face without weariness or lassitude his eyes were fixed on those of Athos and perhaps he comprehended all that passed in the heart of the man who was awaiting his awakening as a lover awaits the awakening of his mistress for his glance in return had all the tenderness of love	113.98074965434911
You are there sir he said respectfully	220.06111033287235
And you did not awaken me	3.4127171198120605
I wished to leave you still to enjoy some moments of sleep my child you must be fatigued from yesterday	162.95105743545722
Oh sir how good you are	4.335973897802842
How do you feel this morning he inquired	102.89266768188047
You are still growing Athos continued with that charming and paternal interest felt by a grown man for a youth	229.0073671310216
Oh sir I beg your pardon exclaimed Raoul ashamed of so much attention in an instant I shall be dressed	131.73270654583197
Everything said Olivain to Athos has been done according to your directions the horses are waiting	194.76853821176206
And I was asleep cried Raoul whilst you sir you had the kindness to attend to all these details	191.6059755293356
Truly sir you overwhelm me with benefits	5943.842216661229
Therefore you love me a little I hope replied Athos in a tone of emotion	76.13689357279844
Oh sir God knows how much I love revere you	165.2497844309988
See that you forget nothing said Athos appearing to look about him that he might hide his emotion	89.79525537617272
The servant then approached Athos and said hesitatingly	765.4483669662824
Monsieur le vicomte has no sword	2792.0934877679265
Tis well said Athos I will take care of that	22.010398716014873
They went downstairs Raoul looking every now and then at the count to see if the moment of farewell was at hand but Athos was silent	115.5845318882908
When they reached the steps Raoul saw three horses	815.8079152934054
Oh sir then you are going with me	27.92221900695485
I will accompany you a portion of the way said Athos	112.38229627474185
Joy shone in Raouls eyes and he leaped lightly to his saddle	102.82399591716654
Athos mounted more slowly after speaking in a low voice to the lackey who instead of following them immediately returned to their rooms	77.98181637381366
Raoul delighted at the counts companionship perceived or affected to perceive nothing of this byplay	1812.9147019478614
They set out passing over the Pont Neuf they pursued their way along the quay then called LAbreuvoir Pepin and went along by the walls of the Grand Chatelet	291.7330703634116
They proceeded to the Rue Saint Denis	580.1118501877298
After passing through the Porte Saint Denis Athos looked at Raouls way of riding and observed	450.2501507983363
Take care Raoul I have already often told you of this you must not forget it for it is a great defect in a rider	69.96755100260587
See your horse is tired already he froths at the mouth whilst mine looks as if he had only just left the stable	250.4723221922072
You hold the bit too tight and so make his mouth hard so that you will not be able to make him manoeuvre quickly	146.91640387671583
The safety of a cavalier often depends on the prompt obedience of his horse	252.39786052445007
In a week remember you will no longer be performing your manoeuvres for practice but on a field of battle	250.19870065408338
Then suddenly in order not to give too uncomfortable an importance to this observation	451.2405756030436
See Raoul he resumed what a fine plain for partridge shooting	2829.717954132847
The young man stored in his mind the admonition whilst he admired the delicate tenderness with which it was bestowed	230.92955793501784
I have remarked also another thing said Athos which is that in firing off your pistol you hold your arm too far outstretched	302.98080662317886
This tension lessens the accuracy of the aim	51.09569253939186
So in twelve times you thrice missed the mark	2477.0949149956195
Which you sir struck twelve times answered Raoul smiling	368.5567105446703
Because I bent my arm and rested my hand on my elbowso do you understand what I mean	86.09429672069545
I have fired since in that manner and have been quite successful	129.9127025157043
What a cold wind resumed Athos a wintry blast	4933.755319987409
Apropos if you fireand you will do so for you are recommended to a young general who is very fond of powderremember that in single combat which often takes place in the cavalry never to fire the first shot	180.1400272358085
He who fires the first shot rarely hits his man for he fires with the apprehension of being disarmed before an armed foe then whilst he fires make your horse rear that manoeuvre has saved my life several times	932.0914384466963
I shall do so if only in gratitude	438.0287075284348
Eh cried Athos are not those fellows poachers they have arrested yonder They are	1726.0202851924746
Then another important thing Raoul should you be wounded in a battle and fall from your horse if you have any strength left disentangle yourself from the line that your regiment has formed otherwise it may be driven back and you will be trampled to death by the horses	148.91354340010463
At all events should you be wounded write to me that very instant or get some one at once to write to me	189.46937640192462
We are judges of wounds we old soldiers Athos added smiling	1673.6573262494855
Thank you sir answered the young man much moved	88.13773688913399
They arrived that very moment at the gate of the town guarded by two sentinels	67.97884366247733
Here comes a young gentleman said one of them who seems as if he were going to join the army	40.59348553540792
How do you make that out inquired Athos	5286.033985446474
By his manner sir and his age he s the second today	283.32355590583603
Has a young man such as I am gone through this morning then asked Raoul	78.36918954091102
Faith yes with a haughty presence a fine equipage such as the son of a noble house would have	106.86446549949717
He will be my companion on the journey sir cried Raoul	226.77740709478215
Alas he can not make me forget what I shall have lost	26.554783110375617
Thus talking they traversed the streets full of people on account of the fete and arrived opposite the old cathedral where first mass was going on	240.17127646215735
Let us alight Raoul said Athos	1732.4528409054947
Olivain take care of our horses and give me my sword	45.61037560576757
The two gentlemen then went into the church	68.49530722554158
Athos gave Raoul some of the holy water	297.6967526937667
A love as tender as that of a lover for his mistress dwells undoubtedly in some paternal hearts toward a son	459.65647190880776
Athos said a word to one of the vergers who bowed and proceeded toward the basement	200.35491682941787
Come Raoul he said let us follow this man	28.7928838652798
The verger opened the iron grating that guarded the royal tombs and stood on the topmost step whilst Athos and Raoul descended	582.9827967634627
The sepulchral depths of the descent were dimly lighted by a silver lamp on the lowest step and just below this lamp there was laid wrapped in a flowing mantle of violet velvet worked with fleursdelis of gold a catafalque resting on trestles of oak	311.07092047566283
The young man prepared for this scene by the state of his own feelings which were mournful and by the majesty of the cathedral which he had passed through descended in a slow and solemn manner and stood with head uncovered before these mortal spoils of the last king who was not to be placed by the side of his forefathers until his successor should take his place there and who appeared to abide on that spot that he might thus address human pride so sure to be exalted by the glories of a throne Dust of the earth Here I await thee	161.8538455680998
Then Athos raised his hand and pointing to the coffin	78.8859530890742
This temporary sepulture is he said that of a man who was of feeble mind yet one whose reign was full of great events because over this king watched the spirit of another man even as this lamp keeps vigil over this coffin and illumines it	257.2715587252336
He whose intellect was thus supreme Raoul was the actual sovereign the other nothing but a phantom to whom he lent a soul and yet so powerful is majesty amongst us this man has not even the honor of a tomb at the feet of him in whose service his life was worn away	165.9724359695242
Remember Raoul this If Richelieu made the king by comparison seem small he made royalty great	2255.6653663251573
The Palace of the Louvre contains two thingsthe king who must die and royalty which never dies	943.5310212863253
The minister so feared so hated by his master has descended into the tomb drawing after him the king whom he would not leave alone on earth lest his work should be destroyed	146.13737689291597
So blind were his contemporaries that they regarded the cardinals death as a deliverance and I even I opposed the designs of the great man who held the destinies of France within the hollow of his hand	143.39941700652977
Raoul learn how to distinguish the king from royalty the king is but a man royalty is the gift of God	151.47907552287649
Whenever you hesitate as to whom you ought to serve abandon the exterior the material appearance for the invisible principle for the invisible principle is everything	451.3232872070168
Raoul I seem to read your future destiny as through a cloud	606.3848257781394
It will be happier I think than ours has been	263.1447768057698
Different in your fate from us you will have a king without a minister whom you may serve love respect	132.2401949078256
Should the king prove a tyrant for power begets tyranny serve love respect royalty that Divine right that celestial spark which makes this dust still powerful and holy so that wegentlemen nevertheless of rank and conditionare as nothing in comparison with the cold corpse there extended	1319.8794664549148
I shall adore God sir said Raoul respect royalty and ever serve the king	752.9644634144433
And if death be my lot I hope to die for the king for royalty and for God	146.81747618010354
Have I sir comprehended your instructions	2495.6743753625556
he said here is your sword	729.2664079657702
Raoul bent his knee to the ground	9.547521143739422
It was worn by my father a loyal gentleman	177.1461769551735
I have worn it in my turn and it has sometimes not been disgraced when the hilt was in my hand and the sheath at my side	125.307199668106
Should your hand still be too weak to use this sword Raoul so much the better	145.89542875353263
You will have the more time to learn to draw it only when it ought to be used	125.49648463473926
Sir replied Raoul putting the sword to his lips as he received it from the count I owe you everything and yet this sword is the most precious gift you have yet made me	61.24989567756658
I will wear it I swear to you as a grateful man should do	87.33558009442422
Tis well arise vicomte embrace me	26.498797933316776
Raoul arose and threw himself with emotion into the counts arms	90.72393571555139
Adieu faltered the count who felt his heart die away within him adieu and think of me	142.83214086840488
Oh for ever and ever cried the youth oh I swear to you sir should any harm befall me your name will be the last name that I shall utter the remembrance of you my last thought	133.5843478468566
Athos hastened upstairs to conceal his emotion and regained with hurried steps the porch where Olivain was waiting with the horses	260.45846313416655
Olivain said Athos showing the servant Raouls shoulderbelt tighten the buckle of the sword it falls too low	1540.0865097453243
You will accompany monsieur le vicomte till Grimaud rejoins you	1441.4124121964296
You know Raoul Grimaud is an old and zealous servant he will follow you	161.3431172880889
Now to horse that I may see you depart	149.1530906863096
Adieu Raoul said the count adieu my dearest boy	3040.337756109041
Adieu sir adieu my beloved protector	1035.667551954875
Athos waved his handhe dared not trust himself to speak and Raoul went away his head uncovered	238.04486333334862
Athos remained motionless looking after him until he turned the corner of the street	28.537822991578373
Then the count threw the bridle of his horse into the hands of a peasant remounted the steps went into the cathedral there to kneel down in the darkest corner and pray	160.08510523136954
One of the Forty Methods of Escape of the Duc de Beaufort	64.0915788359071
Meanwhile time was passing on for the prisoner as well as for those who were preparing his escape only for him it passed more slowly	120.29890470046885
Unlike other men who enter with ardor upon a perilous resolution and grow cold as the moment of execution approaches the Duc de Beaufort whose buoyant courage had become a proverb seemed to push time before him and sought most eagerly to hasten the hour of action	368.6699577922166
In his escape alone apart from his plans for the future which it must be admitted were for the present sufficiently vague and uncertain there was a beginning of vengeance which filled his heart	115.15663471598849
In the first place his escape would be a serious misfortune to Monsieur de Chavigny whom he hated for the petty persecutions he owed to him	188.71605723927465
It would be a still worse affair for Mazarin whom he execrated for the greater offences he had committed	473.7492502523069
It may be observed that there was a proper proportion in his sentiments toward the governor of the prison and the ministertoward the subordinate and the master	175.31938372717835
Then Monsieur de Beaufort who was so familiar with the interior of the Palais Royal though he did not know the relations existing between the queen and the cardinal pictured to himself in his prison all that dramatic excitement which would ensue when the rumor should run from the ministers cabinet to the chamber of Anne of Austria Monsieur de Beaufort has escaped Whilst saying that to himself Monsieur de Beaufort smiled pleasantly and imagined himself already outside breathing the air of the plains and the forests pressing a strong horse between his knees and crying out in a loud voice I am free	182.4207785321039
It is true that on coming to himself he found that he was still within four walls he saw La Ramee twirling his thumbs ten feet from him and his guards laughing and drinking in the antechamber	229.37094806064695
The only thing that was pleasant to him in that odious tableausuch is the instability of the human mindwas the sullen face of Grimaud for whom he had at first conceived such a hatred and who now was all his hope	242.90941484379016
Grimaud seemed to him an Antinous	72937.84359123673
It is needless to say that this transformation was visible only to the prisoners feverish imagination	213.6487276896235
Grimaud was still the same and therefore he retained the entire confidence of his superior La Ramee who now relied upon him more than he did upon himself for as we have said La Ramee felt at the bottom of his heart a certain weakness for Monsieur de Beaufort	124.34816843133453
And so the good La Ramee made a festivity of the little supper with his prisoner	188.0967525642279
He had but one faulthe was a gourmand he had found the pates good the wine excellent	571.0674210755761
Now the successor of Pere Marteau had promised him a pate of pheasant instead of a pate of fowl and Chambertin wine instead of Macon	307.65780445188454
All this set off by the presence of that excellent prince who was so goodnatured who invented so droll tricks against Monsieur de Chavigny and so fine jokes against Mazarin made for La Ramee the approaching Pentecost one of the four great feasts of the year	414.5677282876357
He therefore looked forward to six oclock with as much impatience as the duke himself	186.4015110035765
Since daybreak La Ramee had been occupied with the preparations and trusting no one but himself he had visited personally the successor of Pere Marteau	186.02822987380745
The latter had surpassed himself he showed La Ramee a monstrous pate ornamented with Monsieur de Beauforts coatofarms	1181.9140349314196
It was empty as yet but a pheasant and two partridges were lying near it	443.1149646836066
La Ramees mouth watered and he returned to the dukes chamber rubbing his hands	121.64864823818598
To crown his happiness Monsieur de Chavigny had started on a journey that morning and in his absence La Ramee was deputygovernor of the chateau	165.0673169700608
As for Grimaud he seemed more sullen than ever	184.7729114909944
In the course of the forenoon Monsieur de Beaufort had a game of tennis with La Ramee a sign from Grimaud put him on the alert	262.12656626575387
Grimaud going in advance followed the course which they were to take in the evening	39.95549200540302
The game was played in an inclosure called the little court of the chateau a place quite deserted except when Monsieur de Beaufort was playing and even then the precaution seemed superfluous the wall was so high	251.8299938960458
There were three gates to open before reaching the inclosure each by a different key	610.5754632310116
When they arrived Grimaud went carelessly and sat down by a loophole in the wall letting his legs dangle outside	315.3012989798649
It was evident that there the rope ladder was to be attached	605.6532715929774
This manoeuvre transparent to the Duc de Beaufort was quite unintelligible to La Ramee	170.27812134336628
The game at tennis which upon a sign from Grimaud Monsieur de Beaufort had consented to play began in the afternoon	278.1622544414169
The duke was in full strength and beat La Ramee completely	1247.1748118110224
Four of the guards who were constantly near the prisoner assisted in picking up the tennis balls	821.2519656542879
When the game was over the duke laughing at La Ramee for his bad play offered these men two louis dor to go and drink his health with their four other comrades	483.6336765889762
The guards asked permission of La Ramee who gave it to them but not till the evening however until then he had business and the prisoner was not to be left alone	113.19356099843097
Six oclock came and although they were not to sit down to table until seven oclock dinner was ready and served up	76.55026361870378
Upon a sideboard appeared the colossal pie with the dukes arms on it and seemingly cooked to a turn as far as one could judge by the golden color which illuminated the crust	318.1799227346162
The rest of the dinner was to come	88.33501372508876
Every one was impatient La Ramee to sit down to table the guards to go and drink the duke to escape	98.94754904276087
Grimaud alone was calm as ever	335.0559980072978
One might have fancied that Athos had educated him with the express forethought of such a great event	358.26661761106897
There were moments when looking at Grimaud the duke asked himself if he was not dreaming and if that marble figure was really at his service and would grow animated when the moment came for action	258.13894524256676
La Ramee sent away the guards desiring them to drink to the dukes health and as soon as they were gone shut all the doors put the keys in his pocket and showed the table to the prince with an air that signified	90.22145767376809
The prince looked at Grimaud Grimaud looked at the clock it was hardly a quarterpast six	355.85862216046434
The escape was fixed to take place at seven oclock there was therefore threequarters of an hour to wait	61.370774168722825
The duke in order to pass away another quarter of an hour pretended to be reading something that interested him and muttered that he wished they would allow him to finish his chapter	144.74283894072258
La Ramee went up to him and looked over his shoulder to see what sort of a book it was that had so singular an influence over the prisoner as to make him put off taking his dinner	118.56839118766523
It was Caesars Commentaries which La Ramee had lent him contrary to the orders of the governor and La Ramee resolved never again to disobey these injunctions	292.25178642370577
Meantime he uncorked the bottles and went to smell if the pie was good	149.6722968697827
At halfpast six the duke arose and said very gravely	297.2044087267841
Certainly Caesar was the greatest man of ancient times	112.40619964711304
You think so my lord answered La Ramee	648.9912299510879
Well as for me I prefer Hannibal	24857.272328387764
And why pray Master La Ramee asked the duke	44.092686899403205
Because he left no Commentaries replied La Ramee with his coarse laugh	199.54786179777767
The duke vouchsafed no reply but sitting down at the table made a sign that La Ramee should seat himself opposite	101.72717533412333
There is nothing so expressive as the face of an epicure who finds himself before a well spread table so La Ramee when receiving his plate of soup from Grimaud presented a type of perfect bliss	379.62393266575333
Zounds he said I do nt suppose there is a more contented man at this moment in all the kingdom than yourself	95.10542442303867
You are right my lord duke answered the officer I do nt know any pleasanter sight on earth than a well covered table and when added to that he who does the honors is the grandson of Henry IV	260.94232684122517
you will my lord duke easily comprehend that the honor fairly doubles the pleasure one enjoys	2963.120526954754
The duke in his turn bowed and an imperceptible smile appeared on the face of Grimaud who kept behind La Ramee	168.10626906169853
My dear La Ramee said the duke you are the only man to turn such faultless compliments	199.73864684970147
No my lord duke replied La Ramee in the fullness of his heart I say what I think there is no compliment in what I say to you	58.78375115781484
Then you are attached to me asked the duke	38.808811781515836
To own the truth I should be inconsolable if you were to leave Vincennes	277.0035875652613
A droll way of showing your affliction	3134.6085791892524
The duke meant to say affection	14160.238449885572
But my lord returned La Ramee what would you do if you got out Every folly you committed would embroil you with the court and they would put you into the Bastile instead of Vincennes	257.63748595949505
Now Monsieur de Chavigny is not amiable I allow but Monsieur du Tremblay is considerably worse	748.1227614189177
Indeed exclaimed the duke who from time to time looked at the clock the fingers of which seemed to move with sickening slowness	133.3345088627306
But what can you expect from the brother of a capuchin monk brought up in the school of Cardinal Richelieu Ah my lord it is a great happiness that the queen who always wished you well had a fancy to send you here where there s a promenade and a tennis court good air and a good table	178.49942051511348
In short answered the duke if I comprehend you aright La Ramee I am ungrateful for having ever thought of leaving this place	240.0936495114698
Oh my lord duke tis the height of ingratitude but your highness has never seriously thought of it	175.65224974491431
Yes returned the duke I must confess I sometimes think of it	127.00536854628949
Still by one of your forty methods your highness	2942.2619833723925
My lord said La Ramee now we are quite at our ease and enjoying ourselves pray tell me one of those forty ways invented by your highness	154.41526047833077
Willingly answered the duke give me the pie	172.725796288814
I am listening said La Ramee leaning back in his armchair and raising his glass of Madeira to his lips and winking his eye that he might see the sun through the rich liquid that he was about to taste	81.27963400308725
The duke glanced at the clock	222.92004056754308
In ten minutes it would strike seven	2329.993747222881
Grimaud placed the pie before the duke who took a knife with a silver blade to raise the upper crust but La Ramee who was afraid of any harm happening to this fine work of art passed his knife which had an iron blade to the duke	202.47396329204534
Thank you La Ramee said the prisoner	54.85257667060239
Well my lord this famous invention of yours	750.9554392230438
Must I tell you replied the duke on what I most reckon and what I determine to try first	445.1779214433411
Yes that s the thing my lord cried his custodian gaily	1787.7573533523316
Well I should hope in the first instance to have for keeper an honest fellow like you	277.4351314965461
And you have me my lord	69.80652865003854
Having then a keeper like La Ramee I should try also to have introduced to him by some friend or other a man who would be devoted to me who would assist me in my flight	83.21384480751342
Come come said La Ramee that s not a bad idea	60.02973661774623
Capital is nt it for instance the former servingman of some brave gentleman an enemy himself to Mazarin as every gentleman ought to be	280.7041011371811
Hush do nt let us talk politics my lord	287.79747348736976
Then my keeper would begin to trust this man and to depend upon him and I should have news from those without the prison walls	133.8441340668866
Ah yes but how can the news be brought to you	101.16869999691518
Nothing easier in a game of tennis for example	426.4091614818981
In a game of tennis asked La Ramee giving more serious attention to the dukes words	196.95730024308665
Yes see I send a ball into the moat a man is there who picks it up the ball contains a letter	140.55087836029006
Instead of returning the ball to me when I call for it from the top of the wall he throws me another that other ball contains a letter	96.85853309820394
Thus we have exchanged ideas and no one has seen us do it	34.70339716551271
The devil it does The devil it does said La Ramee scratching his head you are in the wrong to tell me that my lord	125.35172817810269
I shall have to watch the men who pick up balls	601.7279581824322
But resumed La Ramee that is only a way of corresponding	115.5954550163028
And that is a great deal it seems to me	27.672301294215504
Pardon me for instance I say to my friends Be on a certain day on a certain hour at the other side of the moat with two horses	81.12289399252246
Well what then La Ramee began to be uneasy unless the horses have wings to mount the ramparts and come and fetch you	243.2600450557515
I have replied the duke a way of descending from the ramparts	173.16742599898814
Yes but answered La Ramee trying to laugh a ladder of ropes ca nt be sent around a ball like a letter	189.5208693468726
No but it may be sent in something else	411.79624420839764
In something elsein something else In what	8271.67224925767
In a pate said La Ramee	217.73004256467357
Let us suppose one thing replied the duke let us suppose for instance that my maitre dhotel Noirmont has purchased the shop of Pere Marteau	462.19535102484804
Well La Ramee who is a gourmand sees his pates thinks them more attractive than those of Pere Marteau and proposes to me that I shall try them	300.9533188867497
I consent on condition that La Ramee tries them with me	675.9670654706472
That we may be more at our ease La Ramee removes the guards keeping only Grimaud to wait on us	468.7978431838121
Grimaud is the man whom a friend has sent to second me in everything	299.8748099840555
The moment for my escape is fixedseven oclock	2174.8589387955117
Well at a few minutes to seven	248.96873059889822
At a few minutes to seven cried La Ramee cold sweat upon his brow	1827.3430686750587
At a few minutes to seven returned the duke suiting the action to the words I raise the crust of the pie I find in it two poniards a ladder of rope and a gag	397.2440864687238
I point one of the poniards at La Ramees breast and I say to him My friend I am sorry for it but if thou stirrest if thou utterest one cry thou art a dead man	308.60400603631587
The duke in pronouncing these words suited as we have said the action to the words	60.39965560048443
He was standing near the officer and he directed the point of the poniard in such a manner close to La Ramees heart that there could be no doubt in the mind of that individual as to his determination	85.26093214596563
Meanwhile Grimaud still mute as ever drew from the pie the other poniard the rope ladder and the gag	341.2992655218206
La Ramee followed all these objects with his eyes his alarm every moment increasing	192.53191005659966
Oh my lord he cried with an expression of stupefaction in his face you have nt the heart to kill me	52.08756024279773
No not if thou dost not oppose my flight	81.19440122854564
But my lord if I allow you to escape I am a ruined man	52.474378880953196
I will compensate thee for the loss of thy place	180.57490952501215
You are determined to leave the chateau	169.86996793259362
By Heaven and earth This night I am determined to be free	50.92143762254473
And if I defend myself or call or cry out	247.28084180394825
I will kill thee on the honor of a gentleman	15.286797120803762
At this moment the clock struck	3.1246109014757035
Seven oclock said Grimaud who had not spoken a word	19.922913918329957
La Ramee made one movement in order to satisfy his conscience	75.64497146529492
The duke frowned the officer felt the point of the poniard which having penetrated through his clothes was close to his heart	123.36273367629038
Let us dispatch said the duke	885.7266879264508
Bind my arms my lord fast	24428.973900263896
That I may not be considered as your accomplice	148.69285336023145
But with what asked the duke	1001.4693559836351
With your belt my lord replied La Ramee	481.9386712228949
The duke undid his belt and gave it to Grimaud who tied La Ramee in such a way as to satisfy him	143.2367285207687
La Ramee stretched out his legs Grimaud took a tablecloth tore it into strips and tied La Ramees feet together	855.4536215859187
Now my lord said the poor man let me have the poire dangoisse	340.09158379308604
I ask for it without it I should be tried in a court of justice because I did not raise the alarm	85.75577052237736
Thrust it into my mouth my lord thrust it in	243.77105985209155
Grimaud prepared to comply with this request when the officer made a sign as if he had something to say	47.25277560306741
Now my lord do not forget if any harm happens to me on your account that I have a wife and four children	55.71208670977639
Rest assured put the gag in Grimaud	2173.5536802060296
In a second La Ramee was gagged and laid prostrate	1838.492500267727
Two or three chairs were thrown down as if there had been a struggle	37.72631849606967
Grimaud then took from the pocket of the officer all the keys it contained and first opened the door of the room in which they were then shut it and doublelocked it and both he and the duke proceeded rapidly down the gallery which led to the little inclosure	80.02159885079372
At last they reached the tennis court	12316.727411789709
No sentinels no one at any of the windows	144.55258660948218
The duke ran to the rampart and perceived on the other side of the ditch three cavaliers with two riding horses	153.0409484857628
The duke exchanged a signal with them	194.2235525884507
It was indeed for him that they were there	60.48835021232633
Grimaud meantime undid the means of escape	40.936590702052
This was not however a rope ladder but a ball of silk cord with a narrow board which was to pass between the legs the ball to unwind itself by the weight of the person who sat astride upon the board	234.07319855462254
If I am caught I risk nothing but being taken back again to prison	287.7278192550342
If they catch thee thou wilt be hung	961.0494449398129
And instantly Grimaud sitting upon the board as if on horseback commenced his perilous descent	578.1905631837515
The duke followed him with his eyes with involuntary terror	95.81435339091863
He had gone down about threequarters of the length of the wall when the cord broke	101.53296981436924
The duke uttered a cry but Grimaud did not give a single moan	286.9755565415438
He must have been dreadfully hurt for he did not stir from the place where he fell	91.66573515490998
Immediately one of the men who were waiting slipped down into the moat tied under Grimauds shoulders the end of a cord and the remaining two who held the other end drew Grimaud to them	151.2319528545534
Descend my lord said the man in the moat	134.08302479269508
There are only fifteen feet more from the top down here and the grass is soft	165.15935264161473
The duke had already begun to descend	23.371516026081956
His task was the more difficult as there was no board to support him	77.4585121209706
He was obliged to let himself down by his hands and from a height of fifty feet	62.5725364506983
But as we have said he was active strong and full of presence of mind	245.97822928402942
In less than five minutes he arrived at the end of the cord	21.116554835108452
He was then only fifteen feet from the ground as the gentlemen below had told him	78.89614599246742
He let go the rope and fell upon his feet without receiving any injury	154.09954995559406
He instantly began to climb up the slope of the moat on the top of which he met De Rochefort	67.47395522759902
The other two gentlemen were unknown to him	34.5118670473474
Grimaud in a swoon was tied securely to a horse	357.34191055970405
Gentlemen said the duke I will thank you later now we have not a moment to lose	68.64261662253799
On then on those who love me follow me	218.4478920677456
And he jumped on his horse and set off at full gallop snuffing the fresh air in his triumph and shouting out with an expression of face which it would be impossible to describe	64.57878298631772
The timely Arrival of DArtagnan in Paris	70.14423400464474
At Blois DArtagnan received the money paid to him by Mazarin for any future service he might render the cardinal	193.90384732848477
From Blois to Paris was a journey of four days for ordinary travelers but DArtagnan arrived on the third day at the Barriere Saint Denis	204.53150690144335
In turning the corner of the Rue Montmartre in order to reach the Rue Tiquetonne and the Hotel de la Chevrette where he had appointed Porthos to meet him he saw at one of the windows of the hotel that friend himself dressed in a skyblue waistcoat embroidered with silver and gaping till he showed every one of his white teeth whilst the people passing by admiringly gazed at this gentleman so handsome and so rich who seemed to weary of his riches and his greatness	116.96118985674843
DArtagnan and Planchet had hardly turned the corner when Porthos recognized them	319.4282002757141
Eh goodday dear friend replied DArtagnan	6852.80730878765
Porthos came down at once to the threshold of the hotel	34.91814503983758
Ah my dear friend he cried what bad stabling for my horses here	466.250867994768
Indeed said DArtagnan I am most unhappy to hear it on account of those fine animals	167.65027786704465
And I alsoI was also wretchedly off he answered moving backward and forward as he spoke and had it not been for the hostess he added with his air of vulgar selfcomplacency who is very agreeable and understands a joke I should have got a lodging elsewhere	313.1612997563511
The pretty Madeleine who had approached during this colloquy stepped back and turned pale as death on hearing Porthoss words for she thought the scene with the Swiss was about to be repeated	203.8294488419959
But to her great surprise DArtagnan remained perfectly calm and instead of being angry he laughed and said to Porthos	264.38760030153486
Yes I understand the air of La Rue Tiquetonne is not like that of Pierrefonds but console yourself I will soon conduct you to one much better	239.80805419126102
To that exclamation of Porthoss succeeded a groaning low and profound which seemed to come from behind a door	166.04429494767598
DArtagnan who had just dismounted then saw outlined against the wall the enormous stomach of Mousqueton whose downdrawn mouth emitted sounds of distress	988.3632684597239
And you too my poor Monsieur Mouston are out of place in this poor hotel are you not asked DArtagnan in that rallying tone which may indicate either compassion or mockery	226.99628569209554
He finds the cooking detestable replied Porthos	2603.856657506885
Why then does nt he attend to it himself as at Chantilly	645.0886412444244
Ah monsieur I have not here as I had there the ponds of monsieur le prince where I could catch those beautiful carp nor the forests of his highness to provide me with partridges	279.5270347615667
As for the cellar I have searched every part and poor stuff I found	563.665475650517
Monsieur Mouston said DArtagnan I should indeed condole with you had I not at this moment something very pressing to attend to	185.70272277242094
My dear Du Vallon he said here you are in full dress most fortunately for I am going to take you to the cardinals	70.65653086223902
Gracious me really exclaimed Porthos opening his great wondering eyes	1006.818932136954
Oh do nt be distressed you have to deal with a cardinal of another kind	169.12639320112953
This one will not oppress you by his dignity	177.46243963685012
Tis the same thingyou understand me DArtagnana court	9740.063111948304
I was going to say there s no longer a queen	71.74159557130986
The queen Rest assured we shall not see her	17.295727679245537
And you say that we are going from here to the Palais Royal	32.5864430624508
Only that there may be no delay I shall borrow one of your horses	106.27981729892352
Certainly all the four are at your service	43.276991507438055
Oh I need only one of them for the time being	40.6349093657062
Yes you may as well take Mousqueton	8036.5372426484655
As to Planchet he has certain reasons for not going to court	465.6401544079109
Oh he does nt stand well with his eminence	193.1116406756176
Mouston said Porthos saddle Vulcan and Bayard	898.2361793368342
And for myself monsieur shall I saddle Rustaud	19142.623131563218
No take a more stylish horse Phoebus or Superbe we are going with some ceremony	492.15147484021395
Ah said Mousqueton breathing more freely you are only going then to make a visit	108.02926061191845
Oh yes of course Mouston nothing else	337.1366084360734
But to avoid risk put the pistols in the holsters	74.44427219922194
You will find mine on my saddle already loaded	1143.2035897966978
Mouston breathed a sigh he could nt understand visits of ceremony made under arms	512.3203129236061
Indeed said Porthos looking complacently at his old lackey as he went away you are right DArtagnan Mouston will do Mouston has a very fine appearance	319.470046187496
But you my friendare you not going to change your dress	203.40295749780537
No I shall go as I am	6.597596777912444
This traveling dress will serve to show the cardinal my haste to obey his commands	261.4001723882203
They set out on Vulcan and Bayard followed by Mousqueton on Phoebus and arrived at the Palais Royal at about a quarter to seven	155.2815974798006
The streets were crowded for it was the day of Pentecost and the crowd looked in wonder at these two cavaliers one as fresh as if he had come out of a bandbox the other so covered with dust that he looked as if he had but just come off a field of battle	103.64488213197929
Mousqueton also attracted attention and as the romance of Don Quixote was then the fashion they said that he was Sancho who after having lost one master had found two	227.47245829113479
On reaching the palace DArtagnan sent to his eminence the letter in which he had been ordered to return without delay	67.074011001877
He was soon ordered to the presence of the cardinal	41.92771497716642
Courage he whispered to Porthos as they proceeded	63.52413786186811
Believe me the eye of the eagle is closed forever	751.8099122546641
We have only the vulture to deal with	224.83291138206963
Hold yourself as bolt upright as on the day of the bastion of St	67.22355367296423
Gervais and do not bow too low to this Italian that might give him a poor idea of you	77.81402362002214
Mazarin was in his study working at a list of pensions and benefices of which he was trying to reduce the number	215.8872438268326
He saw DArtagnan and Porthos enter with internal pleasure yet showed no joy in his countenance	279.26108667396545
Ah you is it Monsieur le lieutenant you have been very prompt	158.9319595180804
Here I am at your eminences service as well as Monsieur du Vallon one of my old friends who used to conceal his nobility under the name of Porthos	115.4293413484356
Porthos turned his head to the right and to the left and drew himself up with a movement full of dignity	54.753158562719
The best swordsman in the kingdom my lord said DArtagnan	337.1896631667676
Mazarin was as fond of fine soldiers as in later times Frederick of Prussia used to be	979.0856741863388
He admired the strong hands the broad shoulders and the steady eye of Porthos	201.78805138529924
He seemed to see before him the salvation of his administration and of the kingdom sculptured in flesh and bone	493.5576801227799
He remembered that the old association of musketeers was composed of four persons	284.5267457532628
And your two other friends he asked	56.35033563673914
Porthos opened his mouth thinking it a good opportunity to put in a word in his turn DArtagnan checked him by a glance from the corner of his eye	113.27364995645797
They are prevented at this moment but will join us later	117.09748191259673
And this gentleman being disengaged takes to the service willingly he asked	364.38088010983245
Yes my lord and from pure devotion to the cause for Monsieur de Bracieux is rich	256.87776483982583
Rich said Mazarin whom that single word always inspired with a great respect	482.6222546904412
Fifty thousand francs a year said Porthos	445.07084038813434
These were the first words he had spoken	44.817230501722825
From pure zeal resumed Mazarin with his artful smile from pure zeal and devotion then	336.70858755188283
My lord has perhaps no faith in those words said DArtagnan	354.0844226254046
Have you Monsieur le Gascon asked Mazarin supporting his elbows on his desk and his chin on his hands	68.05276725857783
I replied the Gascon I believe in devotion as a word at ones baptism for instance which naturally comes before ones proper name every one is naturally more or less devout certainly but there should be at the end of ones devotion something to gain	560.8643908440246
And your friend for instance what does he expect to have at the end of his devotion	54.96818444692641
Well my lord my friend has three magnificent estates that of Vallon at Corbeil that of Bracieux in the Soissonais and that of Pierrefonds in the Valois	614.2008921742398
Now my lord he would like to have one of his three estates erected into a barony	435.28474466205023
Only that said Mazarin his eyes twinkling with joy on seeing that he could pay for Porthoss devotion without opening his purse only that That can be managed	204.7498329891597
I shall be baron explained Porthos stepping forward	3645.602255526098
I told you so said DArtagnan checking him with his hand and now his eminence confirms it	424.03839667985454
And you Monsieur DArtagnan what do you want	6.229299185266219
My lord said DArtagnan it is twenty years since Cardinal de Richelieu made me lieutenant	414.4601264241927
Yes and you would be gratified if Cardinal Mazarin should make you captain	1073.798800864679
We will see gentlemen we will see	9.98658219136572
Now Monsieur de Vallon said Mazarin what service do you prefer in the town or in the country	140.82035594856816
Porthos opened his mouth to reply	1107.2375819547844
My lord said DArtagnan Monsieur de Vallon is like me he prefers service extraordinarythat is to say enterprises that are considered mad and impossible	526.9251612015452
That boastfulness was not displeasing to Mazarin he fell into meditation	255.012487802951
And yet he said I must admit that I sent for you to appoint you to quiet service I have certain apprehensionswell what is the meaning of that	156.39757005964285
In fact a great noise was heard in the antechamber at the same time the door of the study was burst open and a man covered with dust rushed into it exclaiming	33.67110653996694
My lord the cardinal my lord the cardinal	264.6768081243835
Mazarin thought that some one was going to assassinate him and he drew back pushing his chair on the castors	74.10232901541882
DArtagnan and Porthos moved so as to plant themselves between the person entering and the cardinal	207.9214457019724
Well sir exclaimed Mazarin what s the matter and why do you rush in here as if you were about to penetrate a crowded marketplace	94.44299590644563
My lord replied the messenger I wish to speak to your eminence in secret	43.61211017809625
I am Monsieur du Poins an officer in the guards on duty at the donjon of Vincennes	243.41319774761905
Mazarin perceiving by the paleness and agitation of the messenger that he had something of importance to say made a sign that DArtagnan and Porthos should give place	125.28791207709769
DArtagnan and Porthos withdrew to a corner of the cabinet	141.89394172748766
Speak monsieur speak at once said Mazarin What is the matter	84.52534039241516
The matter is my lord that the Duc de Beaufort has contrived to escape from the Chateau of Vincennes	94.34020717384865
Mazarin uttered a cry and became paler than the man who had brought the news	43.51051229562758
He fell back almost fainting in his chair	22.00532946476303
My lord I saw him run off from the top of the terrace	33.54610044476669
And you did not fire on him	46.23710219803741
Was found locked up in the prisoners room a gag in his mouth and a poniard near him	117.35726122420267
But the man who was under him	132.64994563298976
Was an accomplice of the dukes and escaped along with him	357.57953567020775
My lord said DArtagnan advancing toward the cardinal it seems to me that your eminence is losing precious time	137.12703824956932
It may still be possible to overtake the prisoner	114.57575384573607
France is large the nearest frontier is sixty leagues distant	932.7797419533028
And who is to pursue him cried Mazarin	840.5355991160114
You would arrest the Duc de Beaufort armed in the field	78.11269722874403
If your eminence should order me to arrest the devil I would seize him by the horns and would bring him in	62.25613721601992
So would you said Mazarin looking with astonishment at those two men	77.61887184967672
But the duke will not yield himself without a furious battle	580.5074347523789
Very well said DArtagnan his eyes aflame battle It is a long time since we have had a battle eh Porthos	389.15501256083644
And you think you can catch him	115.67726626544582
Yes if we are better mounted than he	152.1097309838552
Go then take what guards you find here and pursue him	115.28862062848228
You command us my lord to do so	24.396210384487517
And I sign my orders said Mazarin taking a piece of paper and writing some lines Monsieur du Vallon your barony is on the back of the Duc de Beauforts horse you have nothing to do but to overtake it	134.69178065547393
As for you my dear lieutenant I promise you nothing but if you bring him back to me dead or alive you may ask all you wish	73.3734158042273
To horse Porthos said DArtagnan taking his friend by the hand	40.090395714899095
Here I am smiled Porthos with his sublime composure	206.95187366413768
They descended the great staircase taking with them all the guards they found on their road and crying out To arms To arms and immediately put spur to horse which set off along the Rue Saint Honore with the speed of the whirlwind	210.25586592417872
Well baron I promise you some good exercise said the Gascon	248.94239153760915
As they went the citizens awakened left their doors and the street dogs followed the cavaliers barking	504.9344174346629
At the corner of the Cimetiere Saint Jean DArtagnan upset a man it was too insignificant an occurrence to delay people so eager to get on	504.5304398739769
The troop continued its course as though their steeds had wings	560.0105169737518
Alas there are no unimportant events in this world and we shall see that this apparently slight incident came near endangering the monarchy	319.6260038421955
An Adventure on the High Road	29037.27754946884
The musketeers rode the whole length of the Faubourg Saint Antoine and of the road to Vincennes and soon found themselves out of the town then in a forest and then within sight of a village	94.88508055526569
The horses seemed to become more lively with each successive step their nostrils reddened like glowing furnaces	1553.4202747616841
DArtagnan freely applying his spurs was in advance of Porthos two feet at the most Mousqueton followed two lengths behind the guards were scattered according to the varying excellence of their respective mounts	464.69890547911956
From the top of an eminence DArtagnan perceived a group of people collected on the other side of the moat in front of that part of the donjon which looks toward Saint Maur	201.72161830425972
He rode on convinced that in this direction he would gain intelligence of the fugitive	139.64612980376884
In five minutes he had arrived at the place where the guards joined him coming up one by one	128.0811736748556
The several members of that group were much excited	1353.7538141120297
They looked at the cord still hanging from the loophole and broken at about twenty feet from the ground	100.12218450040247
Their eyes measured the height and they exchanged conjectures	1990.0962140599918
On the top of the wall sentinels went and came with a frightened air	243.6470378160168
A few soldiers commanded by a sergeant drove away idlers from the place where the duke had mounted his horse	141.44844932790556
DArtagnan went straight to the sergeant	11086.0961006984
My officer said the sergeant it is not permitted to stop here	63.294294295488854
That prohibition is not for me said DArtagnan	139.5479091993795
Yes my officer unfortunately they are well mounted	124.58551390703386
Four and a fifth whom they carried away wounded	571.7533407627043
Four said DArtagnan looking at Porthos	133779.01659153294
Do you hear baron They are only four	56.01776426679929
A joyous smile lighted Porthoss face	353.20217763498846
How long a start have they	465.4385589895061
Two hours and a quarter my officer	1953.9609164119042
Two hours and a quarterthat is nothing we are well mounted are we not Porthos	232.52125558579738
Porthos breathed a sigh he thought of what was in store for his poor horses	131.96268241272355
Very good said DArtagnan and now in what direction did they set out	196.739173441927
That I am forbidden to tell	79.91174149406363
DArtagnan drew from his pocket a paper	23.294094098651573
Order of the king he said	23.029598087650623
Anger mounted to DArtagnans face he frowned and his cheeks were colored	206.2877977417609
Ah you scoundrel he said to the sergeant I believe you are impudent to me Wait	149.11087217283298
He unfolded the paper presented it to the sergeant with one hand and with the other took a pistol from his holsters and cocked it	54.08889539724735
Order of the king I tell you	19.224344974540752
Read and answer or I will blow out your brains	112.76138701779684
The sergeant saw that DArtagnan was in earnest	78.7141167779152
And by what gate did they go out	65.7424974385895
If you are deceiving me rascal you will be hanged tomorrow	297.975051180018
And if you catch up with them you wo nt come back to hang me murmured the sergeant	140.55025785914904
DArtagnan shrugged his shoulders made a sign to his escort and started	46.2740560834775
This way gentlemen this way he cried directing his course toward the gate that had been pointed out	132.58092236083934
But now that the duke had escaped the concierge had seen fit to fasten the gate with a double lock	102.5938142683949
It was necessary to compel him to open it as the sergeant had been compelled to speak and this took another ten minutes	66.61124126177468
This last obstacle having been overcome the troop pursued their course with their accustomed ardor but some of the horses could no longer sustain this pace three of them stopped after an hours gallop and one fell down	234.7442706164576
DArtagnan who never turned his head did not perceive it	54.96720351717505
Porthos told him of it in his calm manner	74.50588369292225
If only we two arrive said DArtagnan it will be enough since the dukes troop are only four in number	167.4505867577927
And he spurred his courser on	98.63901802696193
At the end of another two hours the horses had gone twelve leagues without stopping their legs began to tremble and the foam they shed whitened the doublets of their masters	191.8395899082884
Let us rest here an instant to give these poor creatures breathing time said Porthos	412.1399582285967
Let us rather kill them yes kill them cried DArtagnan I see fresh tracks tis not a quarter of an hour since they passed this place	259.34969247749586
In fact the road was trodden by horses feet visible even in the approaching gloom of evening	740.0942359395746
They set out after a run of two leagues Mousquetons horse sank	2371.6488327618595
Gracious me said Porthos there s Phoebus ruined	8730.03138300124
The cardinal will pay you a hundred pistoles	58.565591912166795
Let us set out again at full gallop	44.95918770655563
But at last the lieutenants horse refused to go on he could not breathe one last spur instead of making him advance made him fall	350.8670921759851
The devil exclaimed Porthos there s Vulcan foundered	26634.620083878035
Zounds cried DArtagnan then we must stop Give me your horse Porthos	460.07504520175615
What the devil are you doing	51.59660803260192
By Jove I am falling or rather Bayard is falling answered Porthos	912.9092025687833
All three then cried Alls over	3397.5302917841664
It belongs to one of our companions who is overtaking us	226.550345352566
No said DArtagnan it is in advance	179.51563687743229
That is another thing said Porthos and he listened toward the quarter indicated by DArtagnan	254.31742897204754
Monsieur said Mousqueton who abandoning his horse on the high road had come on foot to rejoin his master Phoebus could no longer hold out and	76.01675135653376
In fact at that moment a second neighing was borne to them on the night wind	338.45067332896747
It is five hundred feet from here in advance said DArtagnan	117.24020297955853
True monsieur said Mousqueton and five hundred feet from here is a small huntinghouse	228.72935827691447
I have them at hand monsieur	9693.470580655865
Porthos take yours from your holsters	18123.79929416686
Good said DArtagnan seizing his own now you understand Porthos	323.3064840732681
We are out on the kings service	1329.3508155240381
For the kings service we need horses	2421.221571613277
Then not a word but set to work	850.023413499908
They went on through the darkness silent as phantoms they saw a light glimmering in the midst of some trees	223.63181845286485
Yonder is the house Porthos said the Gascon let me do what I please and do you what I do	44.41470983571584
They glided from tree to tree till they arrived at twenty steps from the house unperceived and saw by means of a lantern suspended under a hut four fine horses	203.84502756958668
A groom was rubbing them down near them were saddles and bridles	721.3821020352103
DArtagnan approached quickly making a sign to his two companions to remain a few steps behind	66.78002204635473
I buy those horses he said to the groom	25.852596419831688
The groom turned toward him with a look of surprise but made no reply	26.95587513009412
Why then did nt you reply	794.7738991294985
Because these horses are not to be sold was the reply	106.54142975006815
I take them then said the lieutenant	138.70178512257195
And he took hold of one within his reach his two companions did the same thing	118.36998655462799
Sir cried the groom they have traversed six leagues and have only been unsaddled half an hour	159.16801287347866
Half an hours rest is enough replied the Gascon	390.3537633141066
The groom cried aloud for help	47.918040120628646
A kind of steward appeared just as DArtagnan and his companions were prepared to mount	231.08428389638524
My dear friend cried the lieutenant if you say a word I will blow out your brains	94.11860231650707
But sir answered the steward do you know that these horses belong to Monsieur de Montbazon	82.91230496155326
So much the better they must be good animals then	210.18116345873852
Sir I shall call my people	691.2567213388529
And I mine I ve ten guards behind me do nt you hear them gallop and I m one of the kings musketeers	221.4906664819303
They all mounted the horses as quickly as possible	50.75745080692505
Halloo hi hi cried the steward the house servants with the carbines	186.1183508863384
On on cried DArtagnan there ll be firing on	1018.9914344593191
They all set off swift as the wind	93.74106968837712
Here cried the steward here whilst the groom ran to a neighboring building	324.3594807542974
Take care of your horses cried DArtagnan to him	192.97845431525093
A gleam like a flash of lightning illumined the road and with the flash was heard the whistling of balls which were fired wildly in the air	121.03499839421907
They fire like grooms said Porthos	1673.8635049655823
In the time of the cardinal people fired better than that do you remember the road to Crevecoeur Mousqueton	617.8350623784053
Ah sir my left side still pains me	573.2127884486296
Are you sure we are on the right track lieutenant	625.8407527294015
Egad did nt you hear these horses belong to Monsieur de Montbazon well Monsieur de Montbazon is the husband of Madame de Montbazon	178.8685606624524
And Madame de Montbazon is the mistress of the Duc de Beaufort	36.96237586253222
Ah I understand replied Porthos she has ordered relays of horses	669.0188310960871
And we are pursuing the duke with the very horses he has just left	100.2078436125217
My dear Porthos you are really a man of most superior understanding said DArtagnan with a look as if he spoke against his conviction	109.14849440653603
Pooh replied Porthos I am what I am	26.731930515455655
They rode on for an hour till the horses were covered with foam and dust	57.65300326391667
Zounds what is yonder cried DArtagnan	3012.9313509248946
You are very lucky if you see anything such a night as this said Porthos	107.74837790056444
I too cried Mousqueton saw them also	706.4794758949018
Ah ah have we overtaken them	133.08263220899826
Good a dead horse said DArtagnan pulling up his horse which shied it seems their horses too are breaking down as well as ours	393.6073406594638
I seem to hear the noise of a troop of horsemen exclaimed Porthos leaning over his horses mane	178.91532987288065
Then we are upon the fugitives	29597.027996168425
But if they are numerous observed Mousqueton tis not we who have them but they who have us	332.07589899544257
Nonsense cried DArtagnan they ll suppose us to be stronger than themselves as were in pursuit they ll be afraid and will disperse	314.12718973575465
Ah do you see cried the lieutenant	120.8139117007418
The lights again this time I too saw them said Porthos	237.98374677977083
On on forward forward cried DArtagnan in his stentorian voice we shall laugh over all this in five minutes	130.03786182657015
The horses excited by pain and emulation raced over the dark road in the midst of which was now seen a moving mass denser and more obscure than the rest of the horizon	125.78249424930914
They rode on in this way for ten minutes	28.892452611850942
Suddenly two dark forms seemed to separate from the mass advanced grew in size and as they loomed up larger and larger assumed the appearance of two horsemen	285.45394665311096
Aha cried DArtagnan they re coming toward us	121.27211357747869
So much the worse for them said Porthos	228.10370030708899
Who goes there cried a hoarse voice	45.2743057814343
The three horsemen made no reply stopped not and all that was heard was the noise of swords drawn from the scabbards and the cocking of the pistols with which the two phantoms were armed	111.73147707548024
Porthos understood him and he and the lieutenant each drew with the left hand a pistol from their bolsters and cocked it in their turn	195.32277851752337
Who goes there was asked a second time	83.22101400421376
Not a step forward or you re dead men	505.0086908701097
Stuff cried Porthos almost choked with dust and chewing his bridle as a horse chews his bit	255.03992008307065
Stuff and nonsense we have seen plenty of dead men in our time	118.83595912239154
Hearing these words the two shadows blockaded the road and by the light of the stars might be seen the shining of their arms	114.51456539932144
Back shouted DArtagnan or you are dead	47.94636995385682
Two shots were the reply to this threat but the assailants attacked their foes with such velocity that in a moment they were upon them a third pistolshot was heard aimed by DArtagnan and one of his adversaries fell	307.2341354155832
As for Porthos he assaulted the foe with such violence that although his sword was thrust aside the enemy was thrown off his horse and fell about ten steps from it	92.4748011304539
Finish Mouston finish the work cried Porthos	1647.302606798922
And he darted on beside his friend who had already begun a fresh pursuit	132.09605296654826
I ve broken my mans skull cried DArtagnan	977.1943097554002
I ve only thrown the fellow down but hark	11115.521416438958
Another shot of a carbine was heard	12.039593351528037
It was Mousqueton who was obeying his masters command	1543.6823517086252
On on cried DArtagnan all goes well we have the first throw	327.21889572831736
Ha ha answered Porthos behold other players appear	3908.5157023457464
And in fact two other cavaliers made their appearance detached as it seemed from the principal group they again disputed the road	397.58008209001497
This time the lieutenant did not wait for the opposite party to speak	69.24684015897246
Stand aside he cried stand off the road	110.01959434369795
What do you want asked a voice	116.75614045642484
The duke Porthos and DArtagnan roared out both at once	356.8383598004961
A burst of laughter was the answer but finished with a groan	146.96648574814097
DArtagnan had with his sword cut in two the poor wretch who had laughed	220.9170326871102
At the same time Porthos and his adversary fired on each other and DArtagnan turned to him	171.82971974025384
Bravo you ve killed him I think	31.542949485976248
What would you have my dear fellow One does nt hit the bullseye every time it is something to hit inside the ring	389.1188345009367
Ho parbleau what is the matter with my horse	50.77969108518529
Your horse is falling said Porthos reining in his own	233.84641743627446
In truth the lieutenants horse stumbled and fell on his knees then a rattling in his throat was heard and he lay down to die	80.10418139089364
He had received in the chest the bullet of DArtagnans first adversary	1571.2500158933103
DArtagnan swore loud enough to be heard in the skies	70.1821468147022
Does your honor want a horse asked Mousqueton	708.5588068968898
Zounds want one cried the Gascon	760.0307974222062
How the devil hast thou two horses asked DArtagnan jumping on one of them	243.80044686761306
Their masters are dead I thought they might be useful so I took them	106.83862988640635
Meantime Porthos had reloaded his pistols	478.97664587008853
Be on the qui vive cried DArtagnan	1374.039034782866
As he spoke two horsemen advanced at full speed	12.310709085743786
Ho your honor cried Mousqueton the man you upset is getting up	296.20084571808275
Why did nt thou do as thou didst to the first man said Porthos	372.08482341462775
I held the horses my hands were full your honor	175.58077000158144
A shot was fired that moment Mousqueton shrieked with pain	2224.360316697533
Ah sir I m hit in the other side exactly opposite the other This hurt is just the fellow of the one I had on the road to Amiens	165.58945365106746
Porthos turned around like a lion plunged on the dismounted cavalier who tried to draw his sword but before it was out of the scabbard Porthos with the hilt of his had struck him such a terrible blow on the head that he fell like an ox beneath the butchers knife	95.183392133144
Mousqueton groaning slipped from his horse his wound not allowing him to keep the saddle	212.99643374181576
On perceiving the cavaliers DArtagnan had stopped and charged his pistol afresh besides his horse he found had a carbine on the bow of the saddle	220.8948638134886
Shall we wait or shall we charge	414.92632211931067
Let us charge them answered the Gascon	75.37135102982981
They spurred on their horses the other cavaliers were only twenty steps from them	95.0735658197652
The king has no authority here answered a deep voice which seemed to proceed from a cloud so enveloped was the cavalier in a whirlwind of dust	135.456723475183
Tis well we will see if the kings name is not a passport everywhere replied the Gascon	107.93741256542391
Two shots were fired at once one by DArtagnan the other by the adversary of Porthos	117.01452082420244
DArtagnans ball took off his enemys hat	4450.840128459064
The ball fired by Porthoss foe went through the throat of his horse which fell groaning	156.95521824993875
For the last time where are you going	31.37595210478031
Good you may be easy thenyoull get there	19203.398735314997
DArtagnan then saw a musketbarrel leveled at him he had no time to draw from his holsters	95.73856250196377
He recalled a bit of advice which Athos had once given him and made his horse rear	226.38232121205266
The ball struck the animal full in front	261.1882304417386
DArtagnan felt his horse giving way under him and with his wonderful agility threw himself to one side	100.13279827513739
Ah this cried the voice the tone of which was at once polished and jeering this is nothing but a butchery of horses and not a combat between men	204.77815747643928
To the sword sir the sword	2441.0167803953927
And he jumped off his horse	12.380935941933231
To the swords be it so replied DArtagnan that is exactly what I want	130.56339939879314
DArtagnan in two steps was engaged with the foe whom according to custom he attacked impetuously but he met this time with a skill and a strength of arm that gave him pause	270.93970668132755
Twice he was obliged to step back his opponent stirred not one inch	5329.402911675197
DArtagnan returned and again attacked him	6.888982629911035
Twice or thrice thrusts were attempted on both sides without effect sparks were emitted from the swords like water spouting forth	881.5659919948455
At last DArtagnan thought it was time to try one of his favorite feints in fencing	200.22451807374006
He brought it to bear skillfully executed it with the rapidity of lightning and struck the blow with a force which he fancied would prove irresistible	146.7326664213456
Sdeath he cried with his Gascon accent	4238.001834864547
At this exclamation his adversary bounded back and bending his bare head tried to distinguish in the gloom the features of the lieutenant	150.5303302048148
As to DArtagnan afraid of some feint he still stood on the defensive	349.69511303299487
Have a care cried Porthos to his opponent I ve still two pistols charged	398.35921405491865
The more reason you should fire the first cried his foe	810.3843916898383
Porthos fired the flash threw a gleam of light over the field of battle	54.559050929524055
As the light shone on them a cry was heard from the other two combatants	129.04461138519912
Athos raised his sword DArtagnan lowered his	412.4696454391449
Aramis cried Athos do nt fire	6857.860994032261
Ah ha is it you Aramis said Porthos	2098.2313270256614
And he threw away his pistol	1174.3297462318142
Aramis pushed his back into his saddlebags and sheathed his sword	187.36871997122668
My son exclaimed Athos extending his hand to DArtagnan	24.05345174262875
This was the name which he gave him in former days in their moments of tender intimacy	208.21390395829508
Athos cried DArtagnan wringing his hands	4.463222626240547
So you defend him And I who have sworn to take him dead or alive I am dishonoredand by you	93.7628671920102
Kill me replied Athos uncovering his breast if your honor requires my death	202.65920838388186
Oh woe is me woe is me cried the lieutenant there s only one man in the world who could stay my hand by a fatality that very man bars my way	104.3297624747789
What shall I say to the cardinal	121.80461346800762
You can tell him sir answered a voice which was the voice of high command in the battlefield that he sent against me the only two men capable of getting the better of four men of fighting man to man without discomfiture against the Comte de la Fere and the Chevalier dHerblay and of surrendering only to fifty men	148.80007619582182
The prince exclaimed at the same moment Athos and Aramis unmasking as they addressed the Duc de Beaufort whilst DArtagnan and Porthos stepped backward	453.4194695057923
Fifty cavaliers cried the Gascon and Porthos	301.9423761593879
Look around you gentlemen if you doubt the fact said the duke	75.76399501368276
The two friends looked to the right to the left they were encompassed by a troop of horsemen	95.44599337619526
Hearing the noise of the fight resumed the duke I fancied you had about twenty men with you so I came back with those around me tired of always running away and wishing to draw my sword in my own cause but you are only two	124.38718782328117
Yes my lord but as you have said two that are a match for twenty said Athos	146.10940176009566
Come gentlemen your swords said the duke	74.53128551055461
Our swords cried DArtagnan raising his head and regaining his selfpossession	144.6907226229555
Some of the men moved toward them	170.2374379912833
One moment my lord whispered Athos and he said something in a low voice	39.70594107007258
As you will replied the duke	1036.275159191178
I am too much indebted to you to refuse your first request	66.10768177465697
Gentlemen he said to his escort withdraw	82752.72416618839
Monsieur dArtagnan Monsieur du Vallon you are free	42.68407513178236
The order was obeyed DArtagnan and Porthos then found themselves in the centre of a large circle	58.87049945773899
Now DHerblay said Athos dismount and come here	101.7443915758116
Aramis dismounted and went to Porthos whilst Athos approached DArtagnan	4336.6089957823215
Friends said Athos do you regret you have not shed our blood	137.93117781829596
No replied DArtagnan I regret to see that we hitherto united are opposed to each other	171.77391631077396
Ah nothing will ever go well with us hereafter	339.9760737001214
Oh Heaven No all is over said Porthos	563.4382857280737
Well be on our side now resumed Aramis	3655.087759640923
Silence DHerblay cried Athos such proposals are not to be made to gentlemen such as these	96.28197615749333
Tis a matter of conscience with them as with us	333.5708446011347
Meantime here we are enemies said Porthos	341.0578502172278
Gramercy who would ever have thought it	51.163616910021084
Athos looked at them both and took their hands in his	30.713340405893643
Gentlemen he said this is a serious business and my heart bleeds as if you had pierced it through and through	115.00655073659038
Yes we are severed there is the great the distressing truth But we have not as yet declared war perhaps we shall have to make certain conditions therefore a solemn conference is indispensable	362.5069559073443
For my own part I demand it said Aramis	239.51518881379633
I accept it interposed DArtagnan proudly	35999.644531399965
Porthos bowed as if in assent	4137.190198981835
Let us choose a place of rendezvous continued Athos and in a last interview arrange our mutual position and the conduct we are to maintain toward each other	336.30590879762406
Will the Place Royale suit you asked DArtagnan	305.2956751518928
Athos and Aramis looked at each other	7.019096912902384
The Place Royalebe it so replied Athos	5025.909720117576
At ten in the evening if that suits you by that time we shall have returned	205.8314572143964
There continued Athos either peace or war will be decided honor at all events will be maintained	142.12056095943396
Alas murmured DArtagnan our honor as soldiers is lost to us forever	368.1080301603881
DArtagnan said Athos gravely I assure you that you do me wrong in dwelling so upon that	110.11060486836048
What I think of is that we have crossed swords as enemies	526.5260354677254
Yes he continued sadly shaking his head Yes it is as you said misfortune indeed has overtaken us	164.813650018666
And we Porthos said DArtagnan will return carrying our shame to the cardinal	279.87016587486255
And tell him cried a voice that I am not too old yet for a man of action	83.62189713502944
DArtagnan recognized the voice of De Rochefort	1744.0020141999362
Can I do anything for you gentlemen asked the duke	66.56838822421801
Bear witness that we have done all that we could	44.62640948671834
That shall be testified to rest assured	4543.431035602555
Adieu we shall meet soon I trust in Paris where you shall have your revenge	45.23123353550468
The duke as he spoke kissed his hand spurred his horse into a gallop and disappeared followed by his troop who were soon lost in distance and darkness	139.00061687071832
DArtagnan and Porthos were now alone with a man who held by the bridles two horses they thought it was Mousqueton and went up to him	107.07141532991497
What do I see cried the lieutenant	112.49731542629351
Grimaud signified that he was not mistaken	99.39704700799673
And whose horses are these cried DArtagnan	1012.4786550237121
Who has given them to us said Porthos	140.6848434516364
Athos Athos muttered DArtagnan you think of every one you are indeed a nobleman Whither art thou going Grimaud	555.706598825801
To join the Vicomte de Bragelonne in Flanders your honor	516.8263745300883
They were taking the road toward Paris when groans which seemed to proceed from a ditch attracted their attention	291.0257639981924
It is IMousqueton said a mournful voice whilst a sort of shadow arose out of the side of the road	76.3629177771082
Art thou dangerously wounded my dear Mousqueton he said	74.12839444455913
No sir but I am severely	27664.288706327316
What can we do said DArtagnan we must return to Paris	67.2442013981669
I will take care of Mousqueton said Grimaud and he gave his arm to his old comrade whose eyes were full of tears nor could Grimaud tell whether the tears were caused by wounds or by the pleasure of seeing him again	108.29634322992263
DArtagnan and Porthos went on meantime to Paris	912.2677617843568
They were passed by a sort of courier covered with dust the bearer of a letter from the duke to the cardinal giving testimony to the valor of DArtagnan and Porthos	131.63403375091914
Mazarin had passed a very bad night when this letter was brought to him announcing that the duke was free and that he would henceforth raise up mortal strife against him	160.91497077547243
What consoles me said the cardinal after reading the letter is that at least in this chase DArtagnan has done me one good turnhe has destroyed Broussel	450.7073314749015
This Gascon is a precious fellow even his misadventures are of use	948.176456546348
The cardinal referred to that man whom DArtagnan upset at the corner of the Cimetiere Saint Jean in Paris and who was no other than the Councillor Broussel	171.17931549115704
The four old Friends prepare to meet again	35.121997326247794
Well said Porthos seated in the courtyard of the Hotel de la Chevrette to DArtagnan who with a long and melancholy face had returned from the Palais Royal did he receive you ungraciously my dear friend	118.26642979210034
Ifaith yes a brute that cardinal	45433.835186408665
What are you eating there Porthos	31048.731006267557
I am dipping a biscuit in a glass of Spanish wine do the same	42.350277116761106
Well how has all gone off	57.16181123888001
Zounds you know there s only one way of saying things so I went in and said My lord we were not the strongest party	181.41861558777848
Yes I know that he said but give me the particulars	42.03223642713885
You know Porthos I could not give him the particulars without naming our friends to name them would be to commit them to ruin so I merely said they were fifty and we were two	194.30924700862283
There was firing nevertheless I heard he said and your swordsthey saw the light of day I presume	164.89549763666017
That is the night my lord I answered	132.35564280623285
Ah cried the cardinal I thought you were a Gascon my friend	88.90068459645563
I am a Gascon said I only when I succeed	244.75014994554797
The answer pleased him and he laughed	350.62745681744383
That will teach me he said to have my guards provided with better horses for if they had been able to keep up with you and if each one of them had done as much as you and your friend you would have kept your word and would have brought him back to me dead or alive	53.103495353450086
Well there s nothing bad in that it seems to me said Porthos	55.30270505627078
Oh mon Dieu no nothing at all	102.05535291830407
It was the way in which he spoke	16.717928550819803
It is incredible how these biscuit soak up wine They are veritable sponges Gimblou another bottle	6627.06631915502
The bottle was brought with a promptness which showed the degree of consideration DArtagnan enjoyed in the establishment	311.47954668700237
So I was going away but he called me back	65.47176158939304
You have had three horses foundered or killed he asked me	480.28514736856505
Why said Porthos that was very good of him it seems to me	61.15857841705534
Oh oh that is a large sum	173.73162285682645
If he knew anything about horses he would dispute the price	341.82310468249256
Faith he was very much inclined to do so the contemptible fellow	118.90132634109764
He made a great start and looked at me	49.11122738141646
I also looked at him then he understood and putting his hand into a drawer he took from it a quantity of notes on a bank in Lyons	81.91197323578297
For a thousand pistolesjust that amount the beggar not one too many	451.44714342803405
Upon my word I think he acted very generously	580.0558375676175
Generously to men who had risked their lives for him and besides had done him a great service	114.95329957955411
Why it seems that I crushed for him a parliament councillor	2422.77288867001
What that little man in black that you upset at the corner of Saint Jean Cemetery	445.2571736913733
That s the man my dear fellow he was an annoyance to the cardinal	59.71119916151405
Unfortunately I did nt crush him flat	1538.933273968854
It seems that he came to himself and that he will continue to be an annoyance	58.550514735828536
See that now said Porthos and I turned my horse aside from going plump on to him That will be for another time	306.40967527642374
He owed me for the councillor the pettifogger	9092.710568385486
But said Porthos if he was not crushed completely	258.74459252907644
Ah Monsieur de Richelieu would have said Five hundred crowns for the councillor	365.48069769858864
Well lets say no more about it	6.44903279801698
How much were your animals worth Porthos	14050.886772758848
Ah if poor Mousqueton were here he could tell you to a fraction	154.3149836645123
No matter you can tell within ten crowns	7800.739579680409
Why Vulcan and Bayard cost me each about two hundred pistoles and putting Phoebus at a hundred and fifty we should be pretty near the amount	313.0159024090749
There will remain then four hundred and fifty pistoles said DArtagnan contentedly	477.1070828671061
Yes said Porthos but there are the equipments	252.2184183218403
Well how much for the equipments	389734.27655713726
If we say one hundred pistoles for the three	143.21507786431235
Good for the hundred pistoles there remains then three hundred and fifty	187.25665290758636
Porthos made a sign of assent	934.8449331537048
We will give the fifty pistoles to the hostess for our expenses said DArtagnan and share the three hundred	259.3781449404415
A paltry piece of business murmured DArtagnan crumpling his note	3351.6764064766344
Pooh said Porthos it is always that	119.4848725190398
Did nt he speak of me in any way	36.97201828916524
Ah yes indeed cried DArtagnan who was afraid of disheartening his friend by telling him that the cardinal had not breathed a word about him yes surely he said	117.44727007052141
Stop I want to remember his exact words	848.0331804616198
He said As to your friend tell him he may sleep in peace	140.1281463330724
Good very good said Porthos that signified as clear as daylight that he still intends to make me a baron	192.4513841536901
At this moment nine oclock struck	82.04145392143036
Ah yes said Porthos there is nine oclock	109.85137871309506
We have a rendezvous you remember at the Place Royale	180.35357908957442
Ah stop hold your peace Porthos do nt remind me of it tis that which has made me so cross since yesterday	149.9338496761912
Because it is a grievous thing for me to meet again those two men who caused the failure of our enterprise	69.96997075744889
And yet said Porthos neither of them had any advantage over us	95.66161352779429
I still had a loaded pistol and you were in full fight sword in hand	296.26731849952165
Yes said DArtagnan but what if this rendezvous had some hidden purpose	550.1320205445354
Oh said Porthos you ca nt think that DArtagnan	116.49363194306098
DArtagnan did not believe Athos to be capable of a deception but he sought an excuse for not going to the rendezvous	104.09856364436018
We must go said the superb lord of Bracieux lest they should say we were afraid	457.6290368788762
We who have faced fifty foes on the high road can well meet two in the Place Royale	212.09275200772777
Yes yes but they took part with the princes without apprising us of it	487.22172117991414
Athos and Aramis have played a game with me which alarms me	223.39551031070303
We discovered yesterday the truth what is the use of going today to learn something else	82.26190682161277
You really have some distrust then said Porthos	189.66602619039344
Of Aramis yes since he has become an abb	96.35749932965855
You ca nt imagine my dear fellow the sort of man he is	35.52888645601387
He sees us on the road which leads him to a bishopric and perhaps will not be sorry to get us out of his way	69.12008891105008
Ah as regards Aramis that is another thing said Porthos and it would nt surprise me at all	106.2566708348674
Perhaps Monsieur de Beaufort will try in his turn to lay hands on us	46.55230239910201
Nonsense He had us in his power and he let us go	36.78938868951256
Besides we can be on our guard let us take arms let Planchet post himself behind us with his carbine	382.38588537932617
Planchet is a Frondeur answered DArtagnan	1673.067130475051
Devil take these civil wars one can no more now reckon on ones friends than on ones footmen said Porthos	691.1113645877489
Ah if Mousqueton were here there s a fellow who will never desert me	144.32309020521072
So long as you are rich Ah my friend tis not civil war that disunites us	863.8792153510258
It is that we are each of us twenty years older it is that the honest emotions of youth have given place to suggestions of interest whispers of ambition counsels of selfishness	471.7435396194608
Yes you are right let us go Porthos but let us go well armed were we not to keep the rendezvous they would declare we were afraid	177.8705004298309
Halloo Planchet here saddle our horses take your carbine	187.9183073090458
Whom are we going to attack sir	1215.0546178275004
No one a mere matter of precaution answered the Gascon	229.3744247682338
You know sir that they wished to murder that good councillor Broussel the father of the people	276.05445509171653
Yes but he has been avenged	12018.944901501407
He was carried home in the arms of the people	33.22363726850781
His house has been full ever since	492.32543577740654
He has received visits from the coadjutor from Madame de Longueville and the Prince de Conti Madame de Chevreuse and Madame de Vendome have left their names at his door	94.50588174396303
Un vent de fronde Sest leve ce matin Je crois quil gronde Contre le Mazarin	11424.28310283552
Un vent de fronde Sest leve ce matin	16934.559054662415
It does nt surprise me said DArtagnan in a low tone to Porthos that Mazarin would have been much better satisfied had I crushed the life out of his councillor	135.70006285986696
You understand then monsieur resumed Planchet that if it were for some enterprise like that undertaken against Monsieur Broussel that you should ask me to take my carbine	207.7458355952022
No do nt be alarmed but where did you get all these details	96.51644264299419
From a good source sir I heard it from Friquet	356.3273288617718
From Friquet I know that name	769.5374524622116
A son of Monsieur de Broussels servant and a lad that I promise you in a revolt will not give away his share to the dogs	172.29929889229402
Is he not a singing boy at Notre Dame asked DArtagnan	371.1565827428123
Yes that is the very boy he s patronized by Bazin	1843.6747965554719
Of what importance is this little reptile to you asked Porthos	635.8141759148116
Gad replied DArtagnan he has already given me good information and he may do the same again	61.92134205937596
Whilst all this was going on Athos and Aramis were entering Paris by the Faubourg St	118.46850039931306
They had taken some refreshment on the road and hastened on that they might not fail at the appointed place	50.69906077863299
Bazin was their only attendant for Grimaud had stayed behind to take care of Mousqueton	228.53590611943906
As they were passing onward Athos proposed that they should lay aside their arms and military costume and assume a dress more suited to the city	205.74801267522133
Oh no dear count cried Aramis is it not a warlike encounter that we are going to	131.86130469986963
That the Place Royale is the termination to the main road to Vendomois and nothing else	218.35079840981308
Are become our most dangerous enemies Athos	11440.245680251286
Let us be on our guard	188.52814801556553
Who can say whether DArtagnan may not have betrayed us to the cardinal who can tell whether Mazarin may not take advantage of this rendezvous to seize us	120.23825386909306
What Aramis you think that DArtagnan that Porthos would lend their hands to such an infamy	374.6551865347165
Among friends my dear Athos no you are right but among enemies it would be only a stratagem	172.9077972048839
Athos crossed his arms and bowed his noble head	105.99920717864757
What can you expect Athos Men are so made and we are not always twenty years old	131.85164501642947
We have cruelly wounded as you know that personal pride by which DArtagnan is blindly governed	683.3844332316357
Did you not observe his despair on the journey As to Porthos his barony was perhaps dependent on that affair	674.2355801049082
Well he found us on his road and will not be baron this time	61.779193159210394
Perhaps that famous barony will have something to do with our interview this evening	61.814211370754656
Let us take our precautions Athos	57342.89781178108
But suppose they come unarmed What a disgrace to us	371.5571096381887
Oh never fear besides if they do we can easily make an excuse we came straight off a journey and are insurgents too	360.89712014159335
An excuse for us to meet DArtagnan with a false excuse to have to make a false excuse to Porthos Oh Aramis continued Athos shaking his head mournfully upon my soul you make me the most miserable of men you disenchant a heart not wholly dead to friendship	222.08472419810204
Go in whatever guise you choose for my part I shall go unarmed	186.5111417300604
No for I will not allow you to do so	10.469103466403151
Tis not one man not Athos only not the Comte de la Fere whom you will ruin by this amiable weakness but a whole party to whom you belong and who depend upon you	146.2928699866872
Be it so then replied Athos sorrowfully	8941.880613028958
And they pursued their road in mournful silence	168.0244236425251
Scarcely had they reached by the Rue de la Mule the iron gate of the Place Royale when they perceived three cavaliers DArtagnan Porthos and Planchet the two former wrapped up in their military cloaks under which their swords were hidden and Planchet his musket by his side	220.91440467854267
They were waiting at the entrance of the Rue Sainte Catharine and their horses were fastened to the rings of the arcade	117.5987881858442
Athos therefore commanded Bazin to fasten up his horse and that of Aramis in the same manner	99.00480181370386
They then advanced two and two and saluted each other politely	785.0672386222201
Now where will it be agreeable to you that we hold our conference inquired Aramis perceiving that people were stopping to look at them supposing that they were going to engage in one of those farfamed duels still extant in the memory of the Parisians and especially the inhabitants of the Place Royale	172.7003393817947
The gate is shut said Aramis but if these gentlemen like a cool retreat under the trees and perfect seclusion I will get the key from the Hotel de Rohan and we shall be well suited	139.7274184512396
DArtagnan darted a look into the obscurity of the Place	30.03063388487748
Porthos ventured to put his head between the railings to try if his glance could penetrate the gloom	383.62481232703277
If you prefer any other place said Athos in his persuasive voice choose for yourselves	654.6681169763891
This place if Monsieur dHerblay can procure the key is the best that we can have was the answer	144.51177835238732
Aramis went off at once begging Athos not to remain alone within reach of DArtagnan and Porthos a piece of advice which was received with a contemptuous smile	240.57056271246321
Aramis returned soon with a man from the Hotel de Rohan who was saying to him	56.95281111810508
You swear sir that it is not so	9.757162651277502
Stop and Aramis gave him a louis dor	962.8205853670078
Ah you will not swear my master said the concierge shaking his head	56.967927889462175
Well one can never say what may happen at present we and these gentlemen are excellent friends	173.86446194776414
Yes certainly added Athos and the other two	51.15382866507943
DArtagnan had heard the conversation and had understood it	75.81836384535485
You see he said to Porthos	9374.53222060555
That man wanted Aramis to swear that we are not going to the Place Royale to fight	82.21160669271347
Athos did not lose sight of the two speakers	57.699428975199915
Aramis opened the gate and faced around in order that DArtagnan and Porthos might enter	690.4836913850872
In passing through the gate the hilt of the lieutenants sword was caught in the grating and he was obliged to pull off his cloak in doing so he showed the butt end of his pistols and a ray of the moon was reflected on the shining metal	100.94542763507076
Do you see whispered Aramis to Athos touching his shoulder with one hand and pointing with the other to the arms which the Gascon wore under his belt	119.20178526411644
Alas I do replied Athos with a deep sigh	19.544803532703586
He entered third and Aramis who shut the gate after him last	79.56904180039686
The two servingmen waited without but as if they likewise mistrusted each other they kept their respective distances	495.43383290552043
They proceeded silently to the centre of the Place but as at this very moment the moon had just emerged from behind a cloud they thought they might be observed if they remained on that spot and therefore regained the shade of the limetrees	124.17722942700685
There were benches here and there the four gentlemen stopped near them at a sign from Athos Porthos and DArtagnan sat down the two others stood in front of them	143.52419492037322
After a few minutes of silent embarrassment Athos spoke	11105.701662244866
Gentlemen he said our presence here is the best proof of former friendship not one of us has failed the others at this rendezvous not one has therefore to reproach himself	119.16017627745305
Hear me count replied DArtagnan instead of making compliments to each other let us explain our conduct to each other like men of right and honest hearts	212.3159408069349
I wish for nothing more have you any cause of complaint against me or Monsieur dHerblay If so speak out answered Athos	394.73429808205856
When I saw you at your chateau at Bragelonne I made certain proposals to you which you perfectly understood instead of answering me as a friend you played with me as a child the friendship therefore that you boast of was not broken yesterday by the shock of swords but by your dissimulation at your castle	212.31529541900647
You asked for candor and you have it	37.7692033837
You ask what I have against you I tell you	32.68112312487061
And I have the same sincerity to show you if you wish Monsieur dHerblay I acted in a similar way to you and you also deceived me	95.83885377368935
Really monsieur you say strange things said Aramis	195.1620065491089
You came seeking me to make to me certain proposals but did you make them No you sounded me nothing more	270.5692005157618
Very well what did I say to you that Mazarin was contemptible and that I would nt serve Mazarin	281.5881777860983
Did I tell you that I would nt serve any other On the contrary I gave you to understand I think that I adhered to the princes	92.73099823564473
We even joked very pleasantly if I remember rightly on the very probable contingency of your being charged by the cardinal with my arrest	207.8541397974328
Were you a party man There is no doubt of that	43.462293221838834
Well why should not we too belong to a party You had your secret and we had ours we did nt exchange them	321.25120691054457
So much the better it proves that we know how to keep our secrets	151.12526012545933
I do not reproach you monsieur said DArtagnan tis only because Monsieur de la Fere has spoken of friendship that I question your conduct	249.56627867437427
And what do you find in it that is worthy of blame asked Aramis haughtily	571.7471792847207
The blood mounted instantly to the temples of DArtagnan who arose and replied	172.55409541152463
I consider it worthy conduct of a pupil of Jesuits	380.814519578468
On seeing DArtagnan rise Porthos rose also these four men were therefore all standing at the same time with a menacing aspect opposite to each other	142.83232573220607
Upon hearing DArtagnans reply Aramis seemed about to draw his sword when Athos prevented him	180.42363481232817
DArtagnan he said you are here tonight still infuriated by yesterdays adventure	1650.6011690526932
I believed your heart noble enough to enable a friendship of twenty years to overcome an affront of a quarter of an hour	82.47465085844905
Come do you really think you have anything to say against me Say it then if I am in fault I will avow the error	121.97164496154201
The grave and harmonious tones of that beloved voice seemed to have still its ancient influence whilst that of Aramis which had become harsh and tuneless in his moments of illhumor irritated him	248.11201187722241
I think monsieur le comte that you had something to communicate to me at your chateau of Bragelonne and that gentlemanhe pointed to Aramishad also something to tell me when I was in his convent	179.98618215363612
At that time I was not concerned in the adventure in the course of which you have so successfully estopped me However because I was prudent you must not take me for a fool	145.77907759935314
If I had wished to widen the breach between those whom Monsieur dHerblay chooses to receive with a rope ladder and those whom he receives with a wooden ladder I could have spoken out	401.7947012954977
What are you meddling with cried Aramis pale with anger suspecting that DArtagnan had acted as a spy on him and had seen him with Madame de Longueville	120.1710080956099
I never meddle save with what concerns me and I know how to make believe that I have nt seen what does not concern me but I hate hypocrites and among that number I place musketeers who are abbs and abbs who are musketeers and he added turning to Porthos heres a gentleman who s of the same opinion as myself	233.27061725262035
Porthos who had not spoken one word answered merely by a word and a gesture	110.42358648205465
He said yes and he put his hand on his sword	19.316439748012428
Aramis started back and drew his	11.855090334971992
DArtagnan bent forward ready either to attack or to stand on his defense	278.3958180365792
Athos at that moment extended his hand with the air of supreme command which characterized him alone drew out his sword and the scabbard at the same time broke the blade in the sheath on his knee and threw the pieces to his right	55.79055492028937
Aramis he said break your sword	361.04403769395685
It must be done said Athos then in a lower and more gentle voice he added	198.10083742126477
Then Aramis paler than before but subdued by these words snapped the serpent blade between his hands and then folding his arms stood trembling with rage	213.65309074641084
These proceedings made DArtagnan and Porthos draw back	469.89949373055305
DArtagnan did not draw his sword Porthos put his back into the sheath	109.01385065143958
Never exclaimed Athos raising his right hand to Heaven never I swear before God who seeth us and who in the darkness of this night heareth us never shall my sword cross yours never my eye express a glance of anger nor my heart a throb of hatred at you	324.2317316069741
We lived together we loved we hated together we shed we mingled our blood together and too probably I may still add that there may be yet a bond between us closer even than that of friendship perhaps there may be the bond of crime for we four we once did condemn judge and slay a human being whom we had not any right to cut off from this world although apparently fitter for hell than for this life	327.98182099847224
DArtagnan I have always loved you as my son Porthos we slept six years side by side Aramis is your brother as well as mine and Aramis has once loved you as I love you now and as I have ever loved you	136.7576801539306
What can Cardinal Mazarin be to us to four men who compelled such a man as Richelieu to act as we pleased What is such or such a prince to us who fixed the diadem upon a great queens head DArtagnan I ask your pardon for having yesterday crossed swords with you Aramis does the same to Porthos now hate me if you can but for my own part I shall ever even if you do hate me retain esteem and friendship for you	214.64657037711524
I repeat my words Aramis and then if you desire it and if they desire it let us separate forever from our old friends	91.30650485863043
There was a solemn though momentary silence which was broken by Aramis	391.05856815682984
I swear he said with a calm brow and kindly glance but in a voice still trembling with recent emotion I swear that I no longer bear animosity to those who were once my friends	148.84151694029057
I regret that I ever crossed swords with you Porthos I swear not only that it shall never again be pointed at your breast but that in the bottom of my heart there will never in future be the slightest hostile sentiment now Athos come	245.28339974719032
Oh no no do not go away exclaimed DArtagnan impelled by one of those irresistible impulses which showed the nobility of his nature the native brightness of his character I swear that I would give the last drop of my blood and the last fragment of my limbs to preserve the friendship of such a friend as you Athosof such a man as you Aramis	142.0075493651093
And he threw himself into the arms of Athos	16.02263521626998
My son exclaimed Athos pressing him in his arms	18.7513056977129
And as for me said Porthos I swear nothing but I m choked	286.3403643770399
Forsooth If I were obliged to fight against you I think I should allow myself to be pierced through and through for I never loved any one but you in the wide world and honest Porthos burst into tears as he embraced Athos	127.42633388417485
My friends said Athos this is what I expected from such hearts as yours	83.58684303022186
Yes I have said it and I now repeat it our destinies are irrevocably united although we now pursue divergent roads	1023.2557374944934
I respect your convictions and whilst we fight for opposite sides let us remain friends	602.5149593616777
Ministers princes kings will pass away like mountain torrents civil war like a forest flame but wewe shall remain I have a presentiment that we shall	618.6662488352575
Yes replied DArtagnan let us still be musketeers and let us retain as our battlestandard that famous napkin of the bastion St	663.4552049655526
Gervais on which the great cardinal had three fleursdelis embroidered	7205.8891196316235
Cardinalists or Frondeurs what matters it Let us meet again as capital seconds in a duel devoted friends in business merry companions in our ancient pleasures	593.5673429896054
And whenever added Athos we meet in battle at this word Place Royale let us put our swords into our left hands and shake hands with the right even in the very lust and music of the hottest carnage	218.28761825929817
And are the first of men added DArtagnan	2325.7654990908063
Gentlemen your hands are we not pretty good Christians	610.7542852381428
Egad said DArtagnan by Heaven yes	1700.923634267157
We should be so on this occasion if only to be faithful to our oath said Aramis	99.95573391798457
Ah I m ready to do what you will cried Porthos even to swear by Mahomet	241.12053764206678
Devil take me if I ve ever been so happy as at this moment	81.14697123352283
And he wiped his eyes still moist	1127.8450014197126
Has not one of you a cross asked Athos	954.1871926500377
Aramis smiled and drew from his vest a cross of diamonds which was hung around his neck by a chain of pearls	67.61570897642363
Well resumed Athos swear on this cross which in spite of its magnificent material is still a cross swear to be united in spite of everything and forever and may this oath bind us to each other and even also our descendants Does this oath satisfy you	284.95312827265417
Yes said they all with one accord	1818.9506763264606
Ah traitor muttered DArtagnan leaning toward Aramis and whispering in his ear you have made us swear on the crucifix of a Frondeuse	156.74443187731464
We hope that the reader has not quite forgotten the young traveler whom we left on the road to Flanders	120.71861481565497
In losing sight of his guardian whom he had quitted gazing after him in front of the royal basilican Raoul spurred on his horse in order not only to escape from his own melancholy reflections but also to hide from Olivain the emotion his face might betray	235.1242028309371
One hours rapid progress however sufficed to disperse the gloomy fancies that had clouded the young mans bright anticipations and the hitherto unfelt pleasure of freedoma pleasure which is sweet even to those who have never known dependenceseemed to Raoul to gild not only Heaven and earth but especially that blue but dim horizon of life we call the future	461.533138431237
Nevertheless after several attempts at conversation with Olivain he foresaw that many days passed thus would prove exceedingly dull and the counts agreeable voice his gentle and persuasive eloquence recurred to his mind at the various towns through which they journeyed and about which he had no longer any one to give him those interesting details which he would have drawn from Athos the most amusing and the best informed of guides	314.6038423925848
Another recollection contributed also to sadden Raoul on their arrival at Sonores he had perceived hidden behind a screen of poplars a little chateau which so vividly recalled that of La Valliere to his mind that he halted for nearly ten minutes to gaze at it and resumed his journey with a sigh too abstracted even to reply to Olivains respectful inquiry about the cause of so much fixed attention	285.42440694398806
The aspect of external objects is often a mysterious guide communicating with the fibres of memory which in spite of us will arouse them at times this thread like that of Ariadne when once unraveled will conduct one through a labyrinth of thought in which one loses ones self in endeavoring to follow that phantom of the past which is called recollection	428.471331585064
Now the sight of this chateau had taken Raoul back fifty leagues westward and had caused him to review his life from the moment when he had taken leave of little Louise to that in which he had seen her for the first time and every branch of oak every gilded weathercock on roof of slates reminded him that instead of returning to the friends of his childhood every instant estranged him further and that perhaps he had even left them forever	210.05100004215006
With a full heart and burning head he desired Olivain to lead on the horses to a wayside inn which he observed within gunshot range a little in advance of the place they had reached	357.8427322145698
As for himself he dismounted and remained under a beautiful group of chestnuts in flower amidst which were murmuring a multitude of happy bees and bade Olivain send the host to him with writing paper and ink to be placed on a table which he found there conveniently ready	262.4643217875729
Olivain obeyed and continued on his way whilst Raoul remained sitting with his elbow leaning on the table from time to time gently shaking the flowers from his head which fell upon him like snow and gazing vaguely on the charming landscape spread out before him dotted over with green fields and groups of trees	188.49753689952374
Raoul had been there about ten minutes during five of which he was lost in reverie when there appeared within the circle comprised in his rolling gaze a man with a rubicund face who with a napkin around his body another under his arm and a white cap upon his head approached him holding paper pen and ink in hand	150.74263806344393
Ha ha laughed the apparition every gentleman seems to have the same fancy for not a quarter of an hour ago a young lad well mounted like you as tall as you and of about your age halted before this clump of trees and had this table and this chair brought here and dined here with an old gentleman who seemed to be his tutor upon a pie of which they have nt left a mouthful and two bottles of Macon wine of which they have nt left a drop but fortunately we have still some of the same wine and some of the same pies left and if your worship will but give your orders	147.4668281773158
No friend replied Raoul smiling I am obliged to you but at this moment I want nothing but the things for which I have askedonly I shall be very glad if the ink prove black and the pen good upon these conditions I will pay for the pen the price of the bottle and for the ink the price of the pie	103.92880809774904
Very well sir said the host Ill give the pie and the bottle of wine to your servant and in this way you will have the pen and ink into the bargain	70.01251678507566
Do as you like said Raoul who was beginning his apprenticeship with that particular class of society who when there were robbers on the highroads were connected with them and who since highwaymen no longer exist have advantageously and aptly filled their vacant place	378.0314144314196
The host his mind at ease about his bill placed pen ink and paper upon the table	86.04809927658376
By a lucky chance the pen was tolerably good and Raoul began to write	237.75552214481192
The host remained standing in front of him looking with a kind of involuntary admiration at his handsome face combining both gravity and sweetness of expression	219.09296676241271
Beauty has always been and always will be allpowerful	293.92600802989284
He s not a guest like the other one here just now observed mine host to Olivain who had rejoined his master to see if he wanted anything and your young master has no appetite	199.19308687057782
My master had appetite enough three days ago but what can one do he lost it the day before yesterday	82.6857219389705
And Olivain and the host took their way together toward the inn Olivain according to the custom of servingmen well pleased with their place relating to the tavernkeeper all that he could say in favor of the young gentleman whilst Raoul wrote on thus	226.9310384211543
SirAfter a four hours march I stop to write to you for I miss you every moment and I am always on the point of turning my head as if to reply when you speak to me	65.29377173831207
I was so bewildered by your departure and so overcome with grief at our separation that I am sure I was able to but very feebly express all the affection and gratitude I feel toward you	187.42628483829915
You will forgive me sir for your heart is of such a generous nature that you can well understand all that has passed in mine	91.47435934171077
I entreat you to write to me for you form a part of my existence and if I may venture to tell you so I also feel anxious	68.48938984464044
It seemed to me as if you were yourself preparing for some dangerous undertaking about which I did not dare to question you since you told me nothing	77.9706725010352
I have therefore as you see great need of hearing from you	215.2148211055029
Now that you are no longer beside me I am afraid every moment of erring	176.95747784556607
You sustained me powerfully sir and I protest to you that today I feel very lonely	164.06842535046763
Will you have the goodness sir should you receive news from Blois to send me a few lines about my little friend Mademoiselle de la Valliere about whose health when we left so much anxiety was felt You can understand honored and dear guardian how precious and indispensable to me is the remembrance of the years that I have passed with you	207.1863115611399
I hope that you will sometimes too think of me and if at certain hours you should miss me if you should feel any slight regret at my absence I shall be overwhelmed with joy at the thought that you appreciate my affection for and my devotion to yourself and that I have been able to prove them to you whilst I had the happiness of living with you	95.99600910321594
After finishing this letter Raoul felt more composed he looked well around him to see if Olivain and the host might not be watching him whilst he impressed a kiss upon the paper a mute and touching caress which the heart of Athos might well divine on opening the letter	263.4035066907486
During this time Olivain had finished his bottle and eaten his pie the horses were also refreshed	523.0540168863118
Raoul motioned to the host to approach threw a crown upon the table mounted his horse and posted his letter at Senlis	213.42370897794757
The rest that had been thus afforded to men and horses enabled them to continue their journey at a good round pace	346.3244984432676
At Verberie Raoul desired Olivain to make some inquiry about the young man who was preceding them he had been observed to pass only threequarters of an hour previously but he was well mounted as the tavernkeeper had already said and rode at a rapid pace	106.34363865104098
Let us try and overtake this gentleman said Raoul to Olivain like ourselves he is on his way to join the army and may prove agreeable company	203.50576026415087
It was about four oclock in the afternoon when Raoul arrived at Compiegne there he dined heartily and again inquired about the young gentleman who was in advance of them	140.13957907768335
He had stopped like Raoul at the Hotel of the Bell and Bottle the best at Compiegne and had started again on his journey saying that he should sleep at Noyon	179.70548380143586
Well let us sleep at Noyon said Raoul	2790.4339797480684
Sir replied Olivain respectfully allow me to remark that we have already much fatigued the horses this morning	94.67363768741076
I think it would be well to sleep here and to start again very early tomorrow	210.4058983017047
Eighteen leagues is enough for the first stage	150.28813141109293
The Comte de la Fere wished me to hasten on replied Raoul that I might rejoin the prince on the morning of the fourth day let us push on then to Noyon it will be a stage similar to those we traveled from Blois to Paris	183.09483017247848
We shall arrive at eight oclock	1.374446493342736
The horses will have a long nights rest and at five oclock tomorrow morning we can be again on the road	74.64339596136976
Olivain dared offer no opposition to this determination but he followed his master grumbling	229.93077548387546
Go on go on said he between his teeth expend your ardor the first day tomorrow instead of journeying twenty leagues you will travel ten the day after tomorrow five and in three days you will be in bed	170.0647956892913
There you must rest young people are such braggarts	355.9032351819359
It was easy to see that Olivain had not been taught in the school of the Planchets and the Grimauds	137.97551808287216
Raoul really felt tired but he was desirous of testing his strength and brought up in the principles of Athos and certain of having heard him speak a thousand times of stages of twentyfive leagues he did not wish to fall far short of his model	128.05871293839618
DArtagnan that man of iron who seemed to be made of nerve and muscle only had struck him with admiration	123.67160267927493
Therefore in spite of Olivains remarks he continued to urge his steed more and more and following a pleasant little path leading to a ferry and which he had been assured shortened the journey by the distance of one league he arrived at the summit of a hill and perceived the river flowing before him	218.08903600186545
A little troop of men on horseback were waiting on the edge of the stream ready to embark	98.09163132082995
Raoul did not doubt this was the gentleman and his escort he called out to him but they were too distant to be heard then in spite of the weariness of his beast he made it gallop but the rising ground soon deprived him of all sight of the travelers and when he had again attained a new height the ferryboat had left the shore and was making for the opposite bank	149.02924561172662
Raoul seeing that he could not arrive in time to cross the ferry with the travelers halted to wait for Olivain	322.6552767265596
At this moment a shriek was heard that seemed to come from the river	42.72996210280475
Raoul turned toward the side whence the cry had sounded and shaded his eyes from the glare of the setting sun with his hand	106.2931972139575
Olivain he exclaimed what do I see below there	372.6460214508166
A second scream more piercing than the first now sounded	79.9804178953761
Oh sir cried Olivain the rope which holds the ferryboat has broken and the boat is drifting	643.4340367769813
But what do I see in the watersomething struggling	1224.8306689282006
Oh yes exclaimed Raoul fixing his glance on one point in the stream splendidly illumined by the setting sun a horse a rider	225.48421431666415
They are sinking cried Olivain in his turn	12.308779590998796
It was true and Raoul was convinced that some accident had happened and that a man was drowning he gave his horse its head struck his spurs into its sides and the animal urged by pain and feeling that he had space open before him bounded over a kind of paling which inclosed the landing place and fell into the river scattering to a distance waves of white froth	208.1106964353479
Ah sir cried Olivain what are you doing Good God	157.64422776479782
Raoul was directing his horse toward the unhappy man in danger	145.90099801799028
This was in fact a custom familiar to him	520.0423463307264
Having been brought up on the banks of the Loire he might have been said to have been cradled on its waves a hundred times he had crossed it on horseback a thousand times had swum across	126.74563855629448
Athos foreseeing the period when he should make a soldier of the viscount had inured him to all kinds of arduous undertakings	251.61800576270878
Oh heavens continued Olivain in despair what would the count say if he only saw you now	116.54890307085984
The count would do as I do replied Raoul urging his horse vigorously forward	688.870230651094
But Ibut I cried Olivain pale and disconsolate rushing about on the shore how shall I cross	402.6371257631166
Leap coward cried Raoul swimming on then addressing the traveler who was struggling twenty yards in front of him Courage sir said he courage we are coming to your aid	249.7167587474797
Olivain advanced retired then made his horse rearturned it and then struck to the core by shame leaped as Raoul had done only repeating	418.9673092392309
I am a dead man we are lost	59.434774110949185
In the meantime the ferryboat had floated away carried down by the stream and the shrieks of those whom it contained resounded more and more	168.8963047307967
A man with gray hair had thrown himself from the boat into the river and was swimming vigorously toward the person who was drowning but being obliged to go against the current he advanced but slowly	150.145021273104
Raoul continued his way and was visibly gaining ground but the horse and its rider of whom he did not lose sight were evidently sinking	262.00672370315164
The nostrils of the horse were no longer above water and the rider who had lost the reins in struggling fell with his head back and his arms extended	116.69758354887807
One moment longer and all would disappear	685.7234582475289
Too late murmured the young man too late	39.16143620928235
The water closed above his head and stifled his voice	54.2631776063826
Raoul sprang from his horse to which he left the charge of its own preservation and in three or four strokes was at the gentlemans side he seized the horse at once by the curb and raised its head above water the animal began to breathe again and as if he comprehended that they had come to his aid redoubled his efforts	106.44734989268107
Raoul at the same time seized one of the young mans hands and placed it on the mane which it grasped with the tenacity of a drowning man	63.65724770652512
Thus sure that the rider would not release his hold Raoul now only directed his attention to the horse which he guided to the opposite bank helping it to cut through the water and encouraging it with words	235.53006387838536
All at once the horse stumbled against a ridge and then placed its foot on the sand	204.34322232703218
Saved exclaimed the man with gray hair who also touched bottom	967.1919342046493
Saved mechanically repeated the young gentleman releasing the mane and sliding from the saddle into Raouls arms Raoul was but ten yards from the shore there he bore the fainting man and laying him down upon the grass unfastened the buttons of his collar and unhooked his doublet	297.54559036669565
A moment later the grayheaded man was beside him	99.04795449405478
Olivain managed in his turn to land after crossing himself repeatedly and the people in the ferryboat guided themselves as well as they were able toward the bank with the aid of a pole which chanced to be in the boat	164.43350747301957
Thanks to the attentions of Raoul and the man who accompanied the young gentleman the color gradually returned to the pale cheeks of the dying man who opened his eyes at first entirely bewildered but who soon fixed his gaze upon the person who had saved him	60.57282979356823
Ah sir he exclaimed it was you Without you I was a dead manthrice dead	478.5110401985459
But one recovers sir as you perceive replied Raoul and we have but had a little bath	178.0954674409483
Oh sir what gratitude I feel exclaimed the man with gray hair	137.66669989708737
Ah there you are my good DArminges I have given you a great fright have I not but it is your own fault	91.82419251789393
You were my tutor why did you not teach me to swim	53.592861169102754
Oh monsieur le comte replied the old man had any misfortune happened to you I should never have dared to show myself to the marshal again	77.26299105308053
But how did the accident happen asked Raoul	1036.4762914500136
Oh sir in the most natural way possible replied he to whom they had given the title of count	75.88752727723461
We were about a third of the way across the river when the cord of the ferryboat broke	118.77566044026389
Alarmed by the cries and gestures of the boatmen my horse sprang into the water	174.6022378991477
I can not swim and dared not throw myself into the river	88.93851387524496
Instead of aiding the movements of my horse I paralyzed them and I was just going to drown myself with the best grace in the world when you arrived just in time to pull me out of the water therefore sir if you will agree henceforward we are friends until death	116.70828059772441
Sir replied Raoul bowing I am entirely at your service I assure you	36.1817226353691
I am called the Count de Guiche continued the young man my father is the Marechal de Grammont and now that you know who I am do me the honor to inform me who you are	68.7757760492883
I am the Viscount de Bragelonne answered Raoul blushing at being unable to name his father as the Count de Guiche had done	257.0307561699238
Viscount your countenance your goodness and your courage incline me toward you my gratitude is already due	273.5617065321739
Sir said Raoul returning the counts pressure of the hand I like you already from my heart pray regard me as a devoted friend I beseech you	158.50437145795632
And now where are you going viscount inquired De Guiche	697.1721422686778
To join the army under the prince count	181.55912512281077
And I too exclaimed the young man in a transport of joy	49.938163235495296
Oh so much the better we will fire the first shot together	244.58156291216608
It is well be friends said the tutor young as you both are you were perhaps born under the same star and were destined to meet	175.6333527026658
And now continued he you must change your clothes your servants to whom I gave directions the moment they had left the ferryboat ought to be already at the inn	128.03444451159592
Linen and wine are both being warmed come	13579.428653939403
The young men had no objection to this proposition on the contrary they thought it very timely	248.70360246639123
They mounted again at once whilst looks of admiration passed between them	605.9289713728125
They were indeed two elegant horsemen with figures slight and upright noble faces bright and proud looks loyal and intelligent smiles	1198.135747537878
De Guiche might have been about eighteen years of age but he was scarcely taller than Raoul who was only fifteen	123.28683496636314
The halt at Noyon was but brief every one there being wrapped in profound sleep	533.0610991908719
Raoul had desired to be awakened should Grimaud arrive but Grimaud did not arrive	1382.233786800548
Doubtless too the horses on their part appreciated the eight hours of repose and the abundant stabling which was granted them	519.0593677883264
The Count de Guiche was awakened at five oclock in the morning by Raoul who came to wish him goodday	83.38659490800902
They breakfasted in haste and at six oclock had already gone ten miles	271.52316364593656
The young counts conversation was most interesting to Raoul therefore he listened much whilst the count talked well and long	523.0785242276768
Brought up in Paris where Raoul had been but once at the court which Raoul had never seen his follies as page two duels which he had already found the means of fighting in spite of the edicts against them and more especially in spite of his tutors vigilancethese things excited the greatest curiosity in Raoul	254.75843176741265
Raoul had only been at M	254.40465380893278
Scarrons house he named to Guiche the people whom he had seen there	126.74202584265947
Guiche knew everybodyMadame de Neuillan Mademoiselle dAubigne Mademoiselle de Scudery Mademoiselle Paulet Madame de Chevreuse	809.2722341633144
Raoul trembled lest he should laugh among the rest at Madame de Chevreuse for whom he entertained deep and genuine sympathy but either instinctively or from affection for the duchess he said everything in her favor	332.49603620082183
His praises increased Raouls friendship twofold	19452.159057028184
Then came the question of gallantry and love affairs	869.8133068430838
Under this head also Bragelonne had much more to hear than to tell	123.27269629132749
He listened attentively and fancied that he discovered through three or four rather frivolous adventures that the count like himself had a secret to hide in the depths of his heart	114.79804390640686
De Guiche as we have said before had been educated at the court and the intrigues of this court were not unknown to him	83.12234686391263
It was the same court of which Raoul had so often heard the Comte de la Fere speak except that its aspect had much changed since the period when Athos had himself been part of it therefore everything which the Count de Guiche related was new to his traveling companion	218.2484304399459
The young count witty and caustic passed all the world in review the queen herself was not spared and Cardinal Mazarin came in for his share of ridicule	359.71288506151615
The day passed away as rapidly as an hour	23.75555754107721
The counts tutor a man of the world and a bon vivant up to his eyes in learning as his pupil described him often recalled the profound erudition the witty and caustic satire of Athos to Raoul but as regarded grace delicacy and nobility of external appearance no one in these points was to be compared to the Comte de la Fere	318.0576069092216
The horses which were more kindly used than on the previous day stopped at Arras at four oclock in the evening	119.08133112623689
They were approaching the scene of war and as bands of Spaniards sometimes took advantage of the night to make expeditions even as far as the neighborhood of Arras they determined to remain in the town until the morrow	187.97343763907924
The French army held all between PontaMarc as far as Valenciennes falling back upon Douai	1544.468132712385
The prince was said to be in person at Bethune	450.81467181966536
The enemys army extended from Cassel to Courtray and as there was no species of violence or pillage it did not commit the poor people on the frontier quitted their isolated dwellings and fled for refuge into the strong cities which held out a shelter to them	331.0682101228481
An approaching battle was much spoken of the prince having manoeuvred until that movement only in order to await a reinforcement that had just reached him	302.705572275105
The young men congratulated themselves on having arrived so opportunely	865.6354235486695
The evening was employed in discussing the war the grooms polished their arms the young men loaded the pistols in case of a skirmish and they awoke in despair having both dreamed that they had arrived too late to participate in the battle	213.06236124830875
In the morning it was rumored that Prince de Cond had evacuated Bethune and fallen back on Carvin leaving however a strong garrison in the former city	1092.252010699215
But as there was nothing positively certain in this report the young warriors decided to continue their way toward Bethune free on the road to diverge to the right and march to Carvin if necessary	435.7458426953342
The counts tutor was well acquainted with the country he consequently proposed to take a crossroad which lay between that of Lens and that of Bethune	190.84262626953793
They obtained information at Ablain and a statement of their route was left for Grimaud	237.11117054562277
About seven oclock in the morning they set out	32.6484200075
De Guiche who was young and impulsive said to Raoul Here we are three masters and three servants	577.4275038867805
Our valets are well armed and yours seems to be tough enough	145.33416909644293
I have never seen him put to the test replied Raoul but he is a Breton which promises something	563.3032289239463
Yes yes resumed De Guiche I am sure he can fire a musket when required	310.78018605228306
On my side I have two sure men who have been in action with my father	88.05870141388694
We therefore represent six fighting men if we should meet a little troop of enemies equal or even superior in number to our own shall we charge them Raoul	263.88347836160443
Holloa young peoplestop there said the tutor joining in the conversation	215.24400450317265
Zounds how you manoeuvre my instructions count You seem to forget the orders I received to conduct you safe and sound to his highness the prince Once with the army you may be killed at your good pleasure but until that time I warn you that in my capacity of general of the army I shall order a retreat and turn my back on the first red coat we come across	186.11448584988582
De Guiche and Raoul glanced at each other smiling	37.658920698983266
They arrived at Ablain without accident	921.3218927848415
There they inquired and learned that the prince had in reality quitted Bethune and stationed himself between Cambria and La Venthie	501.8087914377465
Therefore leaving directions at every place for Grimaud they took a crossroad which conducted the little troop by the bank of a small stream flowing into the Lys	252.55930660501312
The country was beautiful intersected by valleys as green as the emerald	177.0426923728904
Here and there they passed little copses crossing the path which they were following	374.926387086672
In anticipation of some ambuscade in each of these little woods the tutor placed his two servants at the head of the band thus forming the advance guard	238.94987100736938
Himself and the two young men represented the body of the army whilst Olivain with his rifle upon his knee and his eyes upon the watch protected the rear	156.66066384425667
They had observed for some time before them on the horizon a rather thick wood and when they had arrived at a distance of a hundred steps from it Monsieur dArminges took his usual precautions and sent on in advance the counts two grooms	183.36481991823268
The servants had just disappeared under the trees followed by the tutor and the young men were laughing and talking about a hundred yards off	74.62689326329733
Olivain was at the same distance in the rear when suddenly there resounded five or six musketshots	374.63522230670884
The tutor cried halt the young men obeyed pulling up their steeds and at the same moment the two valets were seen returning at a gallop	170.1006078631308
The young men impatient to learn the cause of the firing spurred on toward the servants	220.53212812069347
Were you stopped eagerly inquired the two youths	417.33380488660464
No replied the servants it is even probable that we have not been seen the shots were fired about a hundred paces in advance of us in the thickest part of the wood and we returned to ask your advice	74.68371323788195
My advice is this said Monsieur dArminges and if needs be my will that we beat a retreat	968.2738828934232
There may be an ambuscade concealed in this wood	271.152614532328
Did you see nothing there asked the count	3.461155250629825
I thought I saw said one of the servants horsemen dressed in yellow creeping along the bed of the stream	126.8450769257794
That s it said the tutor	6331.515770979005
We have fallen in with a party of Spaniards	163.45674168288065
The two youths looked at each other and at this moment a pistolshot and cries for help were heard	107.77142001186134
Another glance between the young men convinced them both that neither had any wish to go back and as the tutor had already turned his horses head they both spurred forward Raoul crying Follow me Olivain and the Count de Guiche Follow Urban and Planchet And before the tutor could recover from his surprise they had both disappeared into the forest	341.8204313009775
Whilst they spurred their steeds they held their pistols ready also	203.71106544698858
In five minutes they arrived at the spot whence the noise had proceeded and then restraining their horses they advanced cautiously	159.55765984667832
Hush whispered De Guiche these are cavaliers	976.4009812326062
Yes three on horseback and three who have dismounted	409.92038517228866
Can you see what they are doing	21.056935962557354
Yes they appear to be searching a wounded or dead man	319.780019040913
It is some cowardly assassination said De Guiche	328.68261289794583
They are soldiers though resumed De Bragelonne	3758.6086667366353
Yes skirmishers that is to say highway robbers	10248.277792237484
Oh gentlemen gentlemen in the name of Heaven cried the poor tutor	108.94662757789492
But he was not listened to and his cries only served to arouse the attention of the Spaniards	176.41467684967444
The men on horseback at once rushed at the two youths leaving the three others to complete the plunder of the dead or wounded travelers for on approaching nearer instead of one extended figure the young men discovered two	296.63271904144784
De Guiche fired the first shot at ten paces and missed his man and the Spaniard who had advanced to meet Raoul aimed in his turn and Raoul felt a pain in the left arm similar to that of a blow from a whip	133.79568527493086
He let off his fire at but four paces	1086.7285155046745
Struck in the breast and extending his arms the Spaniard fell back on the crupper and the terrified horse turning around carried him off	154.5463657679509
Raoul at this moment perceived the muzzle of a gun pointed at him and remembering the recommendation of Athos he with the rapidity of lightning made his horse rear as the shot was fired	135.89135013721892
His horse bounded to one side losing its footing and fell entangling Raouls leg under its body	1697.7775929344868
The Spaniard sprang forward and seized the gun by its muzzle in order to strike Raoul on the head with the butt	136.64862676788576
In the position in which Raoul lay unfortunately he could neither draw his sword from the scabbard nor his pistols from their holsters	286.28093538861793
The butt end of the musket hovered over his head and he could scarcely restrain himself from closing his eyes when with one bound Guiche reached the Spaniard and placed a pistol at his throat	119.97007814485616
Yield he cried or you are a dead man The musket fell from the soldiers hands who yielded on the instant	147.6389715509144
Guiche summoned one of his grooms and delivering the prisoner into his charge with orders to shoot him through the head if he attempted to escape he leaped from his horse and approached Raoul	144.41746793973013
Faith sir said Raoul smiling although his pallor betrayed the excitement consequent on a first affair you are in a great hurry to pay your debts and have not been long under any obligation to me	141.32779529774052
Without your aid continued he repeating the counts words I should have been a dead manthrice dead	179.11331848187396
My antagonist took flight replied De Guiche and left me at liberty to come to your assistance	104.19403864538897
But are you seriously wounded I see you are covered with blood	52.63744586450519
I believe said Raoul that I have got something like a scratch on the arm	83.32646722424319
If you will help me to drag myself from under my horse I hope nothing need prevent us continuing our journey	226.13577415526666
Monsieur dArminges and Olivain had already dismounted and were attempting to raise the struggling horse	446.86941388520796
At last Raoul succeeded in drawing his foot from the stirrup and his leg from under the animal and in a second he was on his feet again	94.61661163406112
Faith no thank Heaven replied Raoul but what has become of the poor wretches whom these scoundrels were murdering	244.41376713457183
I fear we arrived too late	24.56987645461834
They have killed them I think and taken flight carrying off their booty	856.1068667216202
My servants are examining the bodies	7392.062859491076
Let us go and see whether they are quite dead or if they can still be helped suggested Raoul	234.7850693048045
Olivain we have come into possession of two horses but I have lost my own	69.25414032229669
Take for yourself the better of the two and give me yours	99.26930667339984
They approached the spot where the unfortunate victims lay	1167.050121661023
Two men lay prone upon the ground one bathed in blood and motionless with his face toward the earth this one was dead	92.16022199084783
The other leaned against a tree supported there by the two valets and was praying fervently with clasped hands and eyes raised to Heaven	252.87422568759675
He had received a ball in his thigh which had broken the bone	270.6518790596778
The young men first approached the dead man	25.900821495554677
He is a priest said Bragelonne he has worn the tonsure	1778.189361137441
Oh the scoundrels to lift their hands against a minister of God	109.06441147779589
Come here sir said Urban an old soldier who had served under the cardinal duke in all his campaigns come here there is nothing to be done with him whilst we may perhaps be able to save the other	118.83092564350379
Save me Oh no said he but help me to die if you can	38.57410213632784
Are you a priest asked Raoul	7943.7571872835115
I ask as your unfortunate companion appeared to me to belong to the church	127.54493081181181
He is the curate of Bethune sir and was carrying the holy vessels belonging to his church and the treasure of the chapter to a safe place the prince having abandoned our town yesterday and as it was known that bands of the enemy were prowling about the country no one dared to accompany the good man so I offered to do so	175.07608135837805
And sir continued the wounded man I suffer much and would like if possible to be carried to some house	121.3603010364812
Where you can be relieved asked De Guiche	734.8863553097831
But perhaps you are not so dangerously wounded as you think said Raoul	288.1551863488975
Sir replied the wounded man believe me there is no time to lose the ball has broken the thigh bone and entered the intestines	161.9795001331115
Are you a surgeon asked De Guiche	2651.490228863333
No but I know a little about wounds and mine I know is mortal	352.24495252417023
Try therefore either to carry me to some place where I may see a priest or take the trouble to send one to me here	63.307790876976426
It is my soul that must be saved as for my body it is lost	87.27582850041671
To die whilst doing a good deed It is impossible	121.13144972085223
Gentlemen in the name of Heaven said the wounded man collecting all his forces as if to get up let us not lose time in useless words	107.59976724783209
Either help me to gain the nearest village or swear to me on your salvation that you will send me the first monk the first cur the first priest you may meet	187.53959117807372
But he added in a despairing tone perhaps no one will dare to come for it is known that the Spaniards are ranging through the country and I shall die without absolution	157.6374273885475
My God my God Good God good God added the wounded man in an accent of terror which made the young men shudder you will not allow that that would be too terrible	62.82178971457671
Calm yourself sir replied De Guiche	450.57612359818324
I swear to you you shall receive the consolation that you ask	129.2749909766207
Only tell us where we shall find a house at which we can demand aid and a village from which we can fetch a priest	101.06444144685412
Thank you and God reward you About half a mile from this on the same road there is an inn and about a mile further on after leaving the inn you will reach the village of Greney	174.93506684094737
There you must find the curate or if he is not at home go to the convent of the Augustines which is the last house on the right and bring me one of the brothers	66.11660353487147
Monk or priest it matters not provided only that he has received from holy church the power of absolving in articulo mortis	606.8922902813521
Monsieur dArminges said De Guiche remain beside this unfortunate man and see that he is removed as gently as possible	227.11722798088132
The vicomte and myself will go and find a priest	43.3877658018637
Go sir replied the tutor but in Heavens name do not expose yourself to danger	182.98567188764062
Besides we are safe for today you know the axiom Non bis in idem	1362.4430633116
Courage sir said Raoul to the wounded man	23.17811106611832
We are going to execute your wishes	84.57847212382865
May Heaven prosper you replied the dying man with an accent of gratitude impossible to describe	38.60966693118101
The two young men galloped off in the direction mentioned and in ten minutes reached the inn	94.78136889352362
Raoul without dismounting called to the host and announced that a wounded man was about to be brought to his house and begged him in the meantime to prepare everything needful	97.47094026305263
He desired him also should he know in the neighborhood any doctor or chirurgeon to fetch him taking on himself the payment of the messenger	319.33494053012805
The host who saw two young noblemen richly clad promised everything they required and our two cavaliers after seeing that preparations for the reception were actually begun started off again and proceeded rapidly toward Greney	1026.24177645627
They had gone rather more than a league and had begun to descry the first houses of the village the redtiled roofs of which stood out from the green trees which surrounded them when coming toward them mounted on a mule they perceived a poor monk whose large hat and gray worsted dress made them take him for an Augustine brother	211.39072257970906
Chance for once seemed to favor them in sending what they were so assiduously seeking	569.4712640918422
He was a man about twentytwo or twentythree years old but who appeared much older from ascetic exercises	1018.8699030535696
His complexion was pale not of that deadly pallor which is a kind of neutral beauty but of a bilious yellow hue his colorless hair was short and scarcely extended beyond the circle formed by the hat around his head and his light blue eyes seemed destitute of any expression	174.58298315823822
Sir began Raoul with his usual politeness are you an ecclesiastic	283.29381473490275
Why do you ask me that replied the stranger with a coolness which was barely civil	159.72947847837648
Because we want to know said De Guiche haughtily	3420.230454055686
The stranger touched his mule with his heel and continued his way	59.60115125511347
In a second De Guiche had sprung before him and barred his passage	137.73725954096247
Answer sir exclaimed he you have been asked politely and every question is worth an answer	197.01875046726806
I suppose I am free to say or not to say who I am to two strangers who take a fancy to ask me	52.98550805872927
It was with difficulty that De Guiche restrained the intense desire he had of breaking the monks bones	1118.034582285824
In the first place he said making an effort to control himself we are not people who may be treated anyhow my friend there is the Viscount of Bragelonne and I am the Count de Guiche	110.5686195487923
Nor was it from caprice we asked the question for there is a wounded and dying man who demands the succor of the church	129.64084990620495
If you be a priest I conjure you in the name of humanity to follow me to aid this man if you be not it is a different matter and I warn you in the name of courtesy of which you appear profoundly ignorant that I shall chastise you for your insolence	91.98209037217883
The pale face of the monk became so livid and his smile so strange that Raoul whose eyes were still fixed upon him felt as if this smile had struck to his heart like an insult	91.39025143636222
He is some Spanish or Flemish spy said he putting his hand to his pistol	117.45686346430048
A glance threatening and transient as lightning replied to Raoul	641.0588861802933
Well sir said De Guiche are you going to reply	58.75785043059458
I am a priest said the young man	3.6404076282560194
Then father said Raoul forcing himself to convey a respect by speech that did not come from his heart if you are a priest you have an opportunity as my friend has told you of exercising your vocation	92.58594078597596
At the next inn you will find a wounded man now being attended by our servants who has asked the assistance of a minister of God	72.11656087071802
I will go said the monk	10445.01908097258
If you do not go sir said De Guiche remember that we have two steeds able to catch your mule and the power of having you seized wherever you may be and then I swear your trial will be summary one can always find a tree and a cord	203.7880901380345
The monks eye again flashed but that was all he merely repeated his phrase I will goand he went	254.5115716827822
Let us follow him said De Guiche it will be the surest plan	271.76525378015236
I was about to propose so doing answered De Bragelonne	1986.0972500746884
In the space of five minutes the monk turned around to ascertain whether he was followed or not	108.57176386800019
You see said Raoul we have done wisely	309.6070886871868
What a horrible face that monk has said De Guiche	1352.8650956432318
Horrible replied Raoul especially in expression	24896.35230032824
Yes yes said De Guiche a strange face but these monks are subject to such degrading practices their fasts make them pale the blows of the discipline make them hypocrites and their eyes become inflamed through weeping for the good things of this life we common folk enjoy but they have lost	625.5922297112751
Well said Raoul the poor man will get his priest but by Heaven the penitent appears to me to have a better conscience than the confessor	146.14796733729764
I confess I am accustomed to priests of a very different appearance	184.29851922729137
Ah exclaimed De Guiche you must understand that this is one of those wandering brothers who go begging on the high road until some day a benefice falls down from Heaven on them they are mostly foreignersScotch Irish or Danish	360.8042405534923
What a misfortune for the wounded man to die under the hands of such a friar	91.56641113877834
Absolution comes not from him who administers it but from God	492.2031023810125
However for my part I would rather die unshriven than have anything to say to such a confessor	150.54222327563943
You are of my opinion are you not viscount and I see you playing with the pommel of your sword as if you had a great inclination to break the holy fathers head	104.70332561293084
Yes count it is a strange thing and one which might astonish you but I feel an indescribable horror at the sight of yonder man	138.3159668663589
Have you ever seen a snake rise up on your path	616.7350956596325
Well it has happened to me to do so in our Blaisois forests and I remember that the first time I encountered one with its eyes fixed upon me curled up swinging its head and pointing its tongue I remained fixed pale and as though fascinated until the moment when the Comte de la Fere	143.91357273549968
No my guardian replied Raoul blushing	3861.5368610630017
Until the moment when the Comte de la Fere resumed Raoul said Come Bragelonne draw your sword then only I rushed upon the reptile and cut it in two just at the moment when it was rising on its tail and hissing ere it sprang upon me	207.68785044859106
Well I vow I felt exactly the same sensation at sight of that man when he said Why do you ask me that and looked so strangely at me	95.91211132202586
Then you regret that you did not cut your serpent in two morsels	370.5498960910987
They had now arrived within sight of the little inn and could see on the opposite side the procession bearing the wounded man and guided by Monsieur dArminges	114.90770346452737
There is the wounded man said De Guiche passing close to the Augustine brother	546.8019323791408
Be good enough to hurry yourself a little monsieur monk	1596.2762744806057
As for Raoul he avoided the monk by the whole width of the road and passed him turning his head away in repulsion	177.14245756984712
The young men rode up to the wounded man to announce that they were followed by the priest	53.569554382751114
He raised himself to glance in the direction which they pointed out saw the monk and fell back upon the litter his face illumined by joy	98.3500153022811
And now said the youths we have done all we can for you and as we are in haste to rejoin the princes army we must continue our journey	74.42735786860696
You will excuse us sir but we are told that a battle is expected and we do not wish to arrive the day after it	84.96523014925026
Go my young sirs said the sick man and may you both be blessed for your piety	159.02531291854618
You have done for me as you promised all that you could do	60.5028320796862
As for me I can only repeat may God protect you and all dear to you	317.3381529899871
Sir said De Guiche to his tutor we will precede you and you can rejoin us on the road to Cambrin	101.02419137140366
The host was at his door and everything was preparedbed bandages and lint and a groom had gone to Lens the nearest village for a doctor	397.45851436698706
Everything said he to Raoul shall be done as you desire but you will not stop to have your wound dressed	139.68754939161846
Oh my woundminetis nothing replied the viscount it will be time to think about it when we next halt only have the goodness should you see a cavalier who makes inquiries about a young man on a chestnut horse followed by a servant to tell him in fact that you have seen me but that I have continued my journey and intend to dine at Mazingarbe and to stop at Cambrin	121.13196140093474
Would it not be safer and more certain if I should ask him his name and tell him yours demanded the host	108.55648399130548
There is no harm in overprecaution	176315.86423124283
I am the Viscount de Bragelonne and he is called Grimaud	206.98062511716807
At this moment the wounded man arrived from one direction and the monk from the other the latter dismounting from his mule and desiring that it should be taken to the stables without being unharnessed	139.0495521120356
Sir monk said De Guiche confess well that brave man and be not concerned for your expenses or for those of your mule all is paid	293.7975795944636
Thanks monsieur said the monk with one of those smiles that made Bragelonne shudder	108.4287832664417
Come count said Raoul who seemed instinctively to dislike the vicinity of the Augustine come I feel ill here and the two young men spurred on	208.6461821720263
The litter borne by two servants now entered the house	149.48801747887427
The host and his wife were standing on the steps whilst the unhappy man seemed to suffer dreadful pain and yet to be concerned only to know if he was followed by the monk	93.06294444702323
At sight of this pale bleeding man the wife grasped her husbands arm	322.5689208853655
Well what s the matter asked the latter are you going to be ill just now	43.56653146806731
No but look replied the hostess pointing to the wounded man I ask you if you recognize him	62.33425397010354
Ah I see you know him exclaimed the wife for you have become pale in your turn	60.40250383767468
Truly cried the host misfortune is coming on our house it is the former executioner of Bethune	116.8698814487417
The former executioner of Bethune murmured the young monk shrinking back and showing on his countenance the feeling of repugnance which his penitent inspired	405.94023130376985
Monsieur dArminges who was at the door perceived his hesitation	101.7347932356138
Sir monk said he whether he is now or has been an executioner this unfortunate being is none the less a man	191.86096083929286
Render to him then the last service he can by any possibility ask of you and your work will be all the more meritorious	168.320685061719
The monk made no reply but silently wended his way to the room where the two valets had deposited the dying man on a bed	90.59458795770024
DArminges and Olivain and the two grooms then mounted their horses and all four started off at a quick trot to rejoin Raoul and his companion	354.1664363982365
Just as the tutor and his escort disappeared in their turn a new traveler stopped on the threshold of the inn	112.05494989571991
What does your worship want demanded the host pale and trembling from the discovery he had just made	80.40828963837748
The traveler made a sign as if he wished to drink and then pointed to his horse and gesticulated like a man who is brushing something	76.51179897519204
Ah diable said the host to himself this man seems dumb	266.26538992162574
And where will your worship drink	2662.6225606453177
There answered the traveler pointing to the table	16.373908549852665
I was mistaken said the host he s not quite dumb	318.55356734239064
And what else does your worship wish for	356.8180667022585
To know if you have seen a young man pass fifteen years of age mounted on a chestnut horse and followed by a groom	81.21849895249723
Then you are called Monsieur Grimaud	23612.926179651004
The traveler made a sign of assent	68.78700920116368
Well then said the host your young master was here a quarter of an hour ago he will dine at Mazingarbe and sleep at Cambrin	135.24040725319298
Grimaud was drinking his wine silently and had just placed his glass on the table to be filled a second time when a terrific scream resounded from the room occupied by the monk and the dying man	77.45670225824858
What is that said he whence comes that cry	2024.797517565171
From the wounded mans room replied the host	90.64107375988478
The former executioner of Bethune who has just been brought in here assassinated by Spaniards and who is now being confessed by an Augustine friar	227.03288857894694
The old executioner of Bethune muttered Grimaud a man between fiftyfive and sixty tall strong swarthy black hair and beard	742.7362254019612
That is he except that his beard has turned gray and his hair is white do you know him asked the host	85.8952081465676
I have seen him once replied Grimaud a cloud darkening his countenance at the picture so suddenly summoned to the bar of recollection	584.3619946890527
At this instant a second cry less piercing than the first but followed by prolonged groaning was heard	207.872259730641
The three listeners looked at one another in alarm	291.64132599404485
We must see what it is said Grimaud	124.97274015733322
It sounds like the cry of one who is being murdered murmured the host	77.83375377755588
Mon Dieu said the woman crossing herself	808.898901952978
If Grimaud was slow in speaking we know that he was quick to act he sprang to the door and shook it violently but it was bolted on the other side	59.48473849203961
Open the door cried the host open it instantly sir monk	2115.6604957121276
Unfasten it or I will break it in said Grimaud	447.4792683664964
The same silence and then ere the host could oppose his design Grimaud seized a pair of pincers he perceived in a corner and forced the bolt	256.67603516393694
The room was inundated with blood dripping from the mattresses upon which lay the wounded man speechless the monk had disappeared	312.48665650106926
The monk cried the host where is the monk	167.80618429581827
Grimaud sprang toward an open window which looked into the courtyard	34.89066418385398
He has escaped by this means exclaimed he	176.04535092361195
Do you think so said the host bewildered boy see if the mule belonging to the monk is still in the stable	369.20263111405984
There is no mule cried he to whom this question was addressed	57.970868122409314
The host clasped his hands and looked around him suspiciously whilst Grimaud knit his brows and approached the wounded man whose worn hard features awoke in his mind such awful recollections of the past	260.4615202139337
There can be no longer any doubt but that it is himself said he	40.841943950186945
Does he still live inquired the innkeeper	154.22503613125826
Making no reply Grimaud opened the poor mans jacket to feel if the heart beat whilst the host approached in his turn but in a moment they both fell back the host uttering a cry of horror and Grimaud becoming pallid	147.14775820152485
The blade of a dagger was buried up to the hilt in the left side of the executioner	30.077514753243996
Run run for help cried Grimaud and I will remain beside him here	129.57677698465767
The host quitted the room in agitation and as for his wife she had fled at the sound of her husbands cries	117.72682365926012
This is what had taken place We have seen that it was not of his own free will but on the contrary very reluctantly that the monk attended the wounded man who had been recommended to him in so strange a manner	64.55787777438302
Perhaps he would have sought to escape by flight had he seen any possibility of doing so	147.95342063175988
He was restrained by the threats of the two gentlemen and by the presence of their attendants who doubtless had received their instructions	108.58081882822476
And besides he considered it most expedient without exhibiting too much illwill to follow to the end his role as confessor	1065.2180043334145
The monk entered the chamber and approached the bed of the wounded man	27.717286050021336
The executioner searched his face with the quick glance peculiar to those who are about to die and have no time to lose	42.43754633115327
He made a movement of surprise and said	55.09895749790745
Men who bear my robe have no age replied the monk dryly	836.6981220711068
Alas speak to me more gently father in my last moments I need a friend	158.4438302832836
Do you suffer much asked the monk	234.83185684628126
Yes but in my soul much more than in my body	99.63676940195131
We will save your soul said the young man but are you really the executioner of Bethune as these people say	93.91160234820771
That is to say eagerly replied the wounded man who doubtless feared that the name of executioner would take from him the last help that he could claimthat is to say I was but am no longer it is fifteen years since I gave up the office	95.304444553192
I still assist at executions but no longer strike the blow myselfno indeed	348.62625098441436
You have then a repugnance to your profession	54.06142003619644
So long as I struck in the name of the law and of justice my profession allowed me to sleep quietly sheltered as I was by justice and law but since that terrible night when I became an instrument of private vengeance and when with personal hatred I raised the sword over one of Gods creaturessince that day	189.72601438579065
The executioner paused and shook his head with an expression of despair	4.985038971152945
Tell me about it said the monk who sitting on the foot of the bed began to be interested in a story so strangely introduced	75.98061285471987
Ah cried the dying man with all the effusiveness of a grief declared after long suppression ah I have sought to stifle remorse by twenty years of good deeds I have assuaged the natural ferocity of those who shed blood on every occasion I have exposed my life to save those who were in danger and I have preserved lives in exchange for that I took away	195.41809713615405
That is not all the money gained in the exercise of my profession I have distributed to the poor I have been assiduous in attending church and those who formerly fled from me have become accustomed to seeing me	190.19449247209775
All have forgiven me some have even loved me but I think that God has not pardoned me for the memory of that execution pursues me constantly and every night I see that womans ghost rising before me	162.5122732156453
A woman You have assassinated a woman then cried the monk	180.33861870060252
You also exclaimed the executioner you use that word which sounds ever in my earsassassinated I have assassinated then and not executed I am an assassin then and not an officer of justice and he closed his eyes with a groan	133.8719242787458
The monk doubtless feared that he would die without saying more for he exclaimed eagerly	103.82497752112928
Go on I know nothing as yet when you have finished your story God and I will judge	70.4134229894669
Oh father continued the executioner without opening his eyes as if he feared on opening them to see some frightful object it is especially when night comes on and when I have to cross a river that this terror which I have been unable to conquer comes upon me it then seems as if my hand grew heavy as if the cutlass was still in its grasp as if the water had the color of blood and all the voices of naturethe whispering of the trees the murmur of the wind the lapping of the waveunited in a voice tearful despairing terrible crying to me Place for the justice of God	151.45331162556158
Delirium murmured the monk shaking his head	2.1646422875682516
The executioner opened his eyes turned toward the young man and grasped his arm	23.920931989548645
Delirium he repeated delirium do you say Oh no I remember too well	50.77639737980434
It was evening I had thrown the body into the river and those words which my remorse repeats to me are those which I in my pride pronounced	211.13964904508606
After being the instrument of human justice I aspired to be that of the justice of God	153.47303148469524
But let me see how was it done Speak said the monk	360.66505607199684
A man came to me and showed me an order and I followed him	71.7223968811459
I reserved the right of refusing if the office they required of me should seem unjust	917.6033204217185
We traveled five or six leagues serious silent and almost without speaking	287.2548462840377
At length through the window of a little hut they showed me a woman sitting leaning on a table and said there is the person to be executed	81.4647890895358
Father that woman was a monster	13987.12741760176
It was said that she had poisoned her second husband she had tried to assassinate her brotherinlaw she had just poisoned a young woman who was her rival and before leaving England she had it was believed caused the favorite of the king to be murdered	151.72630367663473
No she was French but she had married in England	105.57561523224373
The monk turned pale wiped his brow and went and bolted the door	66.26853207111361
The executioner thought that he had abandoned him and fell back groaning upon his bed	80.60093212957432
No no I am here said the monk quickly coming back to him	126.18498617932428
Go on who were those men	14.3632121934692
One of them was a foreigner English I think	510.199075869709
The four others were French and wore the uniform of musketeers	184.59821543282754
I do nt know them but the four other noblemen called the Englishman my lord	308.99173042474365
I see her now as on her knees at my feet with her head thrown back she begged for life	66.13730100034567
I have never understood how I could have laid low a head so beautiful with a face so pale	119.56364175218532
The monk seemed agitated by a strange emotion he trembled all over he seemed eager to put a question which yet he dared not ask	127.4754150906879
At length with a violent effort at selfcontrol	253.12199627511325
The name of that woman he said	30.50756212039056
I do nt know what it was	16.792790772946503
As I have said she was twice married once in France the second time in England	157.3560484286134
Abundance of hairfalling over her shoulders	560.1972937679596
The executioner raised himself on his elbow and gazed with a frightened air at the monk who became livid	80.23914822208201
And you killed her the monk exclaimed	3530.2311974360255
You were the tool of those cowards who dared not kill her themselves You had no pity for that youthfulness that beauty that weakness you killed that woman	396.6621319202742
Alas I have already told you father that woman under that angelic appearance had an infernal soul and when I saw her when I recalled all the evil she had done to me	203.13984721201592
To you What could she have done to you Come tell me	52.2069854974364
She had seduced and ruined my brother a priest	175.1814453806523
She had fled with him from her convent	293.1407696988513
Yes my brother was her first lover and she caused his death	156.4535621781553
Oh father do not look in that way at me Oh I am guilty then you will not pardon me	59.27526973680186
The monk recovered his usual expression	125.34368643835789
Yes yes he said I will pardon you if you tell me all	20.757727855015393
Oh cried the executioner all all all	93.27592522864035
If she seduced your brotheryou said she seduced him did you not	101.08495959038851
If she caused his deathyou said that she caused his death	126.94066347884915
Then you must know what her name was as a young girl	34.09327946920796
Oh mon Dieu cried the executioner I think I am dying	60.649230624219754
Tell me her name and I will give it	13.190891369270695
Her name wasMy God have pity on me murmured the executioner and he fell back on the bed pale trembling and apparently about to die	59.799630801072986
Her name repeated the monk bending over him as if to tear from him the name if he would not utter it her name Speak or no absolution	182.73022521668423
The dying man collected all his forces	131.20417545757593
Anne de Bueil murmured the wounded man	64.17285259995748
Anne de Bueil cried the monk standing up and lifting his hands to Heaven	163.59063307272814
Anne de Bueil You said Anne de Bueil did you not	269.55479141174254
Yes yes that was her name and now absolve me for I am dying	109.05028988364812
I absolve you cried the priest with a laugh which made the dying mans hair stand on end I absolve you I am not a priest	79.08269582263013
You are not a priest cried the executioner	139.1164009434827
I am about to tell you wretched man	394.0234278499721
I am John Francis de Winter	1995.5743286652487
I do not know you said the executioner	89.49118317584139
Wait wait you are going to know me	25.566040284227647
I am John Francis de Winter he repeated and that woman	331.51232956331233
The executioner uttered the first cry that terrible cry which had been first heard	74.68235203221059
Oh pardon me pardon me he murmured if not in the name of God at least in your own name if not as priest then as son	85.27611352616996
Pardon you cried the pretended monk pardon you Perhaps God will pardon you but I never	383.6784644105644
For pitys sake said the executioner extending his arms	143.919194147549
No pity for him who had no pity Die impenitent die in despair die and be damned And drawing a poniard from beneath his robe he thrust it into the breast of the wounded man saying Here is my absolution	262.9708086537636
Then was heard that second cry not so loud as the first and followed by a long groan	68.39256990631543
The executioner who had lifted himself up fell back upon his bed	48.219630464582366
As to the monk without withdrawing the poniard from the wound he ran to the window opened it leaped out into the flowers of a small garden glided onward to the stable took out his mule went out by a back gate ran to a neighbouring thicket threw off his monkish garb took from his valise the complete habiliment of a cavalier clothed himself in it went on foot to the first post secured there a horse and continued with a loose rein his journey to Paris	204.55545146669277
Grimaud was left alone with the executioner who in a few moments opened his eyes	53.44742031777147
Help help he murmured oh God have I not a single friend in the world who will aid me either to live or to die	74.99679143930398
Take courage said Grimaud they are gone to find assistance	70.54179815225991
Who are you asked the wounded man fixing his half opened eyes on Grimaud	314.41310811849667
You and the wounded man sought to recall the features of the person now before him	60.83944976683038
Under what circumstances did we meet he asked again	142.35228734451377
One night twenty years ago my master fetched you from Bethune and conducted you to Armentieres	684.5592155055585
I know you well now said the executioner you were one of the four grooms	71.23310628799153
Where do you come from now	1872.431573173016
I was passing by and drew up at this inn to rest my horse	136.2075179432507
They told me the executioner of Bethune was here and wounded when you uttered two piercing cries	552.7655303901882
At the first we ran to the door and at the second forced it open	72.0753900380155
And the monk exclaimed the executioner did you see the monk	249.22320299978162
The monk that was shut in with me	96.40266991049246
No he was no longer here he appears to have fled by the window	78.0320711869978
Was he the man that stabbed you	2415.251949310588
Grimaud moved as if to leave the room	29.962266953543104
What are you going to do asked the wounded man	18.95664855916827
Do not attempt it he has revenged himself and has done well	132.10500535797996
Now I may hope that God will forgive me since my crime is expiated	132.22888506064214
The woman whom you and your masters commanded me to kill	147.9391114952373
Yes Milady it is true you called her thus	354.2808668677484
What has the monk to do with this Milady	177.30183882496
Grimaud trembled and stared at the dying man in a dull and leaden manner	75.3278356828362
But does he know this secret then	298.16331481510673
I mistook him for a monk and revealed it to him in confession	249.56168772637776
Unhappy man cried Grimaud whose face was covered with sweat at the bare idea of the evil results such a revelation might cause unhappy man you named no one I hope	165.43794771384023
I pronounced no name for I knew none except his mothers as a young girl and it was by this name that he recognized her but he knows that his uncle was among her judges	116.75228975801222
Thus speaking he fell back exhausted	7527.592634364073
Grimaud wishing to relieve him advanced his hand toward the hilt of the dagger	101.67224024734067
Touch me not said the executioner if this dagger is withdrawn I shall die	221.7160288365881
Grimaud remained with his hand extended then striking his forehead he exclaimed	178.5473002964722
Oh if this man should ever discover the names of the others my master is lost	127.76186145279794
Haste haste to him and warn him cried the wounded man if he still lives warn his friends too	344.7480638430479
My death believe me will not be the end of this atrocious misadventure	152.76174053669368
Where was the monk going asked Grimaud	4021.643253184402
Two young gentlemen who were on their way to join the army and the name of one of whom I heard his companion mentionthe Viscount de Bragelonne	85.03003230826009
And it was this young man who brought the monk to you Then it was the will of God that it should be so and this it is which makes it all so awful continued Grimaud	105.43055458517271
And yet that woman deserved her fate do you not think so	55.10369423320444
On ones deathbed the crimes of others appear very small in comparison with ones own said the executioner and falling back exhausted he closed his eyes	215.85074235235928
Grimaud was reluctant to leave the man alone and yet he perceived the necessity of starting at once to bear these tidings to the Comte de la Fere	59.51343815208101
Whilst he thus hesitated the host reentered the room followed not only by a surgeon but by many other persons whom curiosity had attracted to the spot	196.1787550337704
The surgeon approached the dying man who seemed to have fainted	23.176824903820087
We must first extract the steel from the side said he shaking his head in a significant manner	73.99685513608813
The prophecy which the wounded man had just uttered recurred to Grimaud who turned away his head	66.65972913487374
The weapon as we have already stated was plunged into the body to the hilt and as the surgeon taking it by the end drew it forth the wounded man opened his eyes and fixed them on him in a manner truly frightful	104.86255484467831
When at last the blade had been entirely withdrawn a red froth issued from the mouth of the wounded man and a stream of blood spouted afresh from the wound when he at length drew breath then fixing his eyes upon Grimaud with a singular expression the dying man uttered the last deathrattle and expired	138.17000083989075
Then Grimaud lifting the dagger from the pool of blood which was gliding along the room to the horror of all present made a sign to the host to follow him paid him with a generosity worthy of his master and again mounted his horse	85.75952556777514
Grimauds first intention had been to return to Paris but he remembered the anxiety which his prolonged absence might occasion Raoul and reflecting that there were now only two miles between the vicomte and himself and a quarter of an hours riding would unite them and that the going returning and explanation would not occupy an hour he put spurs to his horse and a few minutes after had reached the only inn of Mazingarbe	196.5896644308639
Raoul was seated at table with the Count de Guiche and his tutor when all at once the door opened and Grimaud presented himself travelstained dirty and sprinkled with the blood of the unhappy executioner	145.42299790110542
Grimaud my good Grimaud exclaimed Raoul here you are at last Excuse me sirs this is not a servant but a friend	156.2814025422648
How did you leave the count continued he	126.31273464461853
Does he regret me a little Have you seen him since I left him Answer for I have many things to tell you too indeed the last three days some odd adventures have happenedbut what is the matter how pale you are and blood too What is this	156.71673646513258
It is the blood of the unfortunate man whom you left at the inn and who died in my arms	48.299855810141885
In your armsthat man but know you who he was	103.40641115415268
He used to be the headsman of Bethune	1158.0629263110463
You knew him and he is dead	32.03716557782639
Well sir said DArminges it is the common lot even an executioner is not exempted	570.6781979403825
I had a bad opinion of him the moment I saw his wound and since he asked for a monk you know that it was his opinion too that death would follow	104.94113031712759
At the mention of the monk Grimaud became pale	2512.481283583825
Come come continued DArminges to dinner for like most men of his age and generation he did not allow sentiment or sensibility to interfere with a repast	306.52829893552183
You are right sir said Raoul	4394.45883429859
Come Grimaud order dinner for yourself and when you have rested a little we can talk	89.99696243579149
I can not stop a moment I must start for Paris again immediately	147.34966875839248
What You start for Paris You are mistaken it is Olivain who leaves me you are to remain	88.76447041604787
On the contrary Olivain is to stay and I am to go	65.5193705885746
I have come for nothing else but to tell you so	39.36734705191988
But what is the meaning of this change	32.690006124888455
Come tell me what is the joke	363.5270242035124
Monsieur le vicomte knows that I never joke	399.960705863256
Yes but I know also that Monsieur le Comte de la Fere arranged that you were to remain with me and that Olivain should return to Paris	87.69849754689587
I shall follow the counts directions	18499.93361701516
Perhaps you mean to disobey me	3.938912555477891
Yes I am going may you be happy monsieur and Grimaud saluted and turned toward the door to go out	124.83595292371774
Raoul angry and at the same time uneasy ran after him and seized him by the arm	43.943896661819615
Grimaud he cried remain I wish it	88.12344940564974
Then replied Grimaud you wish me to allow monsieur le comte to be killed	101.72477164067492
He saluted and made a movement to depart	647.5991095297337
Grimaud my friend said the viscount will you leave me thus in such anxiety Speak speak in Heavens name And Raoul fell back trembling upon his chair	280.4348414917241
I can tell you but one thing sir for the secret you wish to know is not my own	45.02819412859245
You met a monk did you not	2.9137728955353857
The young men looked at each other with an expression of fear	9.298981314917876
You conducted him to the wounded man and you had time to observe him and perhaps you would know him again were you to meet him	72.56493676339899
Yes yes cried both young men	20.068721034310958
Very well if ever you meet him again wherever it may be whether on the high road or in the street or in a church anywhere that he or you may be put your foot on his neck and crush him without pity without mercy as you would crush a viper or a scorpion destroy him utterly and quit him not until he is dead the lives of five men are not safe in my opinion as long as he is on the earth	117.90184645055
And without adding another word Grimaud profiting by the astonishment and terror into which he had thrown his auditors rushed from the room	162.62749698238505
Two minutes later the thunder of a horses hoofs was heard upon the road it was Grimaud on his way to Paris	78.10912630922176
When once in the saddle Grimaud reflected on two things first that at the pace he was going his horse would not carry him ten miles and secondly that he had no money	226.96275112055247
But Grimauds ingenuity was more prolific than his speech and therefore at the first halt he sold his steed and with the money obtained from the purchase took post horses	311.0895994208689
Raoul was aroused from his sombre reflections by his host who rushed into the apartment crying out The Spaniards the Spaniards	206.5377379385081
That cry was of such importance as to overcome all preoccupation	419.5208236749338
The young men made inquiries and ascertained that the enemy was advancing by way of Houdin and Bethune	209.75042971626135
While Monsieur dArminges gave orders for the horses to be made ready for departure the two young men ascended to the upper windows of the house and saw in the direction of Marsin and of Lens a large body of infantry and cavalry	83.50437941067086
This time it was not a wandering troop of partisans it was an entire army	440.14353397623825
There was therefore nothing for them to do but to follow the prudent advice of Monsieur dArminges and beat a retreat	253.49104576283762
Olivain had ready the horses of the young men and the lackeys of the Count de Guiche guarded carefully between them the Spanish prisoner mounted on a pony which had been bought for his use	131.96159355753832
As a further precaution they had bound his hands	104.28414254408477
The little company started off at a trot on the road to Cambrin where they expected to find the prince	50.28478027742053
But he was no longer there having withdrawn on the previous evening to La Bassee misled by false intelligence of the enemys movements	487.9487753576666
Deceived by this intelligence he had concentrated his forces between VieilleChapelle and La Venthie and after a reconnoissance along the entire line in company with Marshal de Grammont he had returned and seated himself before a table with his officers around him	313.9282941996824
He questioned them as to the news they had each been charged to obtain but nothing positive had been learned	261.6123175022251
The hostile army had disappeared two days before and seemed to have gone out of existence	43.589306113448856
Now an enemy is never so near and consequently so threatening as when he has completely disappeared	218.69815060681776
The prince was therefore contrary to his custom gloomy and anxious when an officer entered and announced to Marshal de Grammont that some one wished to see him	172.49855911978923
The Duc de Grammont received permission from the prince by a glance and went out	129.07260436521537
The prince followed him with his eyes and continued looking at the door no one ventured to speak for fear of disturbing him	65.78508788727399
Suddenly a dull and heavy noise was heard	13.440161337861591
The prince leaped to his feet extending his hand in the direction whence came the sound there was no mistaking itit was the noise of cannon	224.85877090232316
At that moment the door opened	4.251346275446272
Monseigneur said Marshal de Grammont with a radiant face will your highness permit my son Count de Guiche and his traveling companion Viscount de Bragelonne to come in and give news of the enemy whom they have found while we were looking for him	185.3107590599761
What eagerly replied the prince will I permit I not only permit I desire let them come in	215.97823531599056
The marshal introduced the two young men and placed them face to face with the prince	58.24883126419343
Speak gentlemen said the prince saluting them first speak we shall have time afterward for the usual compliments	448.14550288535935
The most urgent thing now is to learn where the enemy is and what he is doing	158.97987482673648
It fell naturally to the Count de Guiche to make reply not only was he the elder but he had been presented to the prince by his father	114.7372557363415
Besides he had long known the prince whilst Raoul now saw him for the first time	139.01080016668334
He therefore narrated to the prince what they had seen from the inn at Mazingarbe	139.12394961740245
Meanwhile Raoul closely observed the young general already made so famous by the battles of Rocroy Fribourg and Nordlingen	824.1332528455739
Louis de Bourbon Prince de Cond who since the death of his father Henri de Bourbon was called in accordance with the custom of that period Monsieur le Prince was a young man not more than twentysix or twentyseven years old with the eye of an eagleagl occhi grifani as Dante saysaquiline nose long waving hair of medium height well formed possessed of all the qualities essential to the successful soldierthat is to say the rapid glance quick decision fabulous courage	396.96632872624605
At the same time he was a man of elegant manners and strong mind so that in addition to the revolution he had made in war by his new contributions to its methods he had also made a revolution at Paris among the young noblemen of the court whose natural chief he was and who in distinction from the social leaders of the ancient court modeled after Bassompierre Bellegarde and the Duke dAngouleme were called the petitsmaitres	281.68811937598304
At the first words of the Count de Guiche the prince having in mind the direction whence came the sound of cannon had understood everything	212.56973490845328
The enemy was marching upon Lens with the intention doubtless of securing possession of that town and separating from France the army of France	262.38087369079335
But in what force was the enemy Was it a corps sent out to make a diversion Was it an entire army To this question De Guiche could not respond	419.8253797898441
Now as these questions involved matters of gravest consequence it was these to which the prince had especially desired an answer exact precise positive	826.5503365988278
Raoul conquered the very natural feeling of timidity he experienced and approaching the prince	340.29713959494524
My lord he said will you permit me to hazard a few words on that subject which will perhaps relieve you of your uncertainty	144.05313225305008
The prince turned and seemed to cover the young man with a single glance he smiled on perceiving that he was a child hardly fifteen years old	68.93372401269691
Certainly monsieur speak he said softening his stern accented tones as if he were speaking to a woman	210.79996686825328
My lord said Raoul blushing might examine the Spanish prisoner	1785.5617334744454
Have you a Spanish prisoner cried the prince	125.8321676879501
Ah that is true said De Guiche I had forgotten it	148.02097561833756
That is easily understood it was you who took him count said Raoul smiling	140.84665115432463
The old marshal turned toward the viscount grateful for that praise of his son whilst the prince exclaimed	331.6650487486866
The young man is right let the prisoner be brought in	150.4061349551924
Meanwhile the prince took De Guiche aside and asked him how the prisoner had been taken and who this young man was	61.252667776979926
Monsieur said the prince turning toward Raoul I know that you have a letter from my sister Madame de Longueville but I see that you have preferred commending yourself to me by giving me good counsel	85.5683923214392
My lord said Raoul coloring up I did not wish to interrupt your highness in a conversation so important as that in which you were engaged with the count	97.10566673715608
Very well said the prince give it to me later	129.06957015281606
Here is the prisoner let us attend to what is most pressing	178.0593764928434
The prisoner was one of those military adventurers who sold their blood to whoever would buy and grew old in stratagems and spoils	986.7968979779523
Since he had been taken he had not uttered a word so that it was not known to what country he belonged	63.802012015263564
The prince looked at him with unspeakable distrust	1918.8612380608863
Of what country are you asked the prince	52.60802792398858
The prisoner muttered a few words in a foreign tongue	71.09893950760622
Ah ah it seems that he is a Spaniard	103.75013662910723
And I not at all said the prince laughing	67.9071976496434
Gentlemen he said turning to those who were near him can any one of you speak Spanish and serve me as interpreter	198.5662186836812
I can my lord said Raoul	9640.63536159189
Enough I think to fulfill your highnesss wishes on this occasion	197.3856734498448
Meanwhile the prisoner had remained impassive and as if he had no understanding of what was taking place	73.72249863420274
My lord asks of what country you are said the young man in the purest Castilian	72.2175163661748
Ich bin ein Deutscher replied the prisoner	208.5391664049818
What in the devil does he say asked the prince	80.82191690163665
He says he is German my lord replied Raoul but I doubt it for his accent is bad and his pronunciation defective	340.163257512859
Then you speak German also asked the prince	101.12978905864439
Well enough to question him in that language	152.06956588544145
Raoul began the examination but the result justified his opinion	410.1770527556631
The prisoner did not understand or seemed not to understand what Raoul said to him and Raoul could hardly understand his replies containing a mixture of Flemish and Alsatian	321.83803121886035
However amidst all the prisoners efforts to elude a systematic examination Raoul had recognized his natural accent	1165.2245269847817
Non siete Spagnuolo he said non siete Tedesco siete Italiano	25590.423740645612
The prisoner started and bit his lips	36.711495269803535
Ah that said the prince I understand that language thoroughly and since he is Italian I will myself continue the examination	271.98391172173
Thank you viscount continued the prince laughing and I appoint you from this moment my interpreter	247.5037339454029
But the prisoner was not less unwilling to respond in Italian than in the other languages his aim was to elude the examination	351.3464582467254
Therefore he knew nothing either of the enemys numbers or of those in command or of the purpose of the army	101.75248981837143
Very good said the prince understanding the reason of that ignorance the man was caught in the act of assassination and robbery he might have purchased his life by speaking he does nt wish to speak	104.77429264507954
Take him out and shoot him	10.478930947742782
The two soldiers who had brought him in took him each by one arm and led him toward the door whilst the prince turning to Marshal de Grammont seemed to have already forgotten the order he had given	107.05873655460253
When he reached the threshold of the door the prisoner stopped	76.49699390168868
The soldiers who knew only their orders attempted to force him along	259.09274441188677
One moment said the prisoner in French	296.92219073747935
I am ready to speak my lord	47.13765573588239
Ah ah said the prince laughing I thought we should come to that	85.02289309051336
I have a sure method of limbering tongues	2445.9225886776712
Young men take advantage of it against the time when you may be in command	70.01121714821072
But on condition continued the prisoner that your highness will swear that my life shall be safe	160.80613513780298
Upon my honor said the prince	862.9168006126346
Where did the army cross the Lys	740.907881283544
By Count de Fuonsaldagna General Beck and the archduke	1163.8285871058351
Of how many does it consist	369940.4678463457
Eighteen thousand men and thirtysix cannon	50797.759521501845
You see gentlemen said the prince turning with a triumphant air toward Marshal de Grammont and the other officers	276.5817906963021
Yes my lord said the marshal you have divined all that was possible to human genius	270.54022683741516
Recall Le Plessis Bellievre Villequier and DErlac said the prince recall all the troops that are on this side of the Lys	199.3663012906505
Let them hold themselves in readiness to march tonight	912.1826501352397
Tomorrow according to all probability we shall attack the enemy	149.95515814617792
But my lord said Marshal de Grammont consider that when we have collected all our forces we shall have hardly thirteen thousand men	242.72363328760952
Monsieur le marechal said the prince with that wonderful glance that was peculiar to him it is with small armies that great battles are won	306.61085463863066
Then turning toward the prisoner Take away that man he said and keep him carefully in sight	322.82761921270804
His life is dependent on the information he has given us if it is true he shall be free if false let him be shot	72.42682938572013
Count de Guiche said the prince it is a long time since you saw your father remain here with him	49.29266653829217
Monsieur he continued addressing Raoul if you are not too tired follow me	106.48208308175222
To the end of the world my lord cried Raoul feeling an unknown enthusiasm for that young general who seemed to him so worthy of his renown	280.8848171944699
The prince smiled he despised flatterers but he appreciated enthusiasts	5799.012063841152
Come monsieur he said you are good in council as we have already discovered tomorrow we shall know if you are good in action	102.25424005579544
And I said the marshal what am I to do	48.53226465964025
Wait here to receive the troops	4874.494559713585
I shall either return for them myself or shall send a courier directing you to bring them to me	143.04310435181353
Twenty guards well mounted are all that I shall need for my escort	91.37372227101196
That is very few said the marshal	412.51392559295596
It is enough replied the prince	417.4209926924742
Have you a good horse Monsieur de Bragelonne	413.2829101632153
My horse was killed this morning my lord and I am mounted provisionally on my lackeys	294.1824447204219
Choose for yourself in my stables the horse you like best	721.388301924142
No false modesty take the best horse you can find	111.25441979400982
You will need it this evening perhaps you will certainly need it tomorrow	157.00524028991882
Raoul did nt wait to be told twice he knew that with superiors especially when those superiors are princes the highest politeness is to obey without delay or argument he went down to the stables picked out a piebald Andalusian horse saddled and bridled it himself for Athos had advised him to trust no one with those important offices at a time of danger and went to rejoin the prince who at that moment mounted his horse	274.3392204680477
Now monsieur he said to Raoul will you give me the letter you have brought	65.26003666990502
Raoul handed the letter to the prince	50.28474950611023
Keep near me said the latter	90.80373061110035
The prince threw his bridle over the pommel of the saddle as he was wo nt to do when he wished to have both hands free unsealed the letter of Madame de Longueville and started at a gallop on the road to Lens attended by Raoul and his small escort whilst messengers sent to recall the troops set out with a loose rein in other directions	176.80376727083254
The prince read as he hastened on	200.26036869918067
Monsieur he said after a moment they tell me great things of you	92.84199573308202
I have only to say after the little that I have seen and heard that I think even better of you than I have been told	56.31941970566087
Meanwhile as the little troop drew nearer to Lens the noise of the cannon sounded louder	165.21154712347993
The prince kept his gaze fixed in the direction of the sound with the steadfastness of a bird of prey	50.1025732247023
One would have said that his gaze could pierce the branches of trees which limited his horizon	214.97355780329218
From time to time his nostrils dilated as if eager for the smell of powder and he panted like a horse	237.36325744609027
At length they heard the cannon so near that it was evident they were within a league of the field of battle and at a turn of the road they perceived the little village of Aunay	102.46229454303982
The peasants were in great commotion	132475.78074220908
The report of Spanish cruelty had gone out and every one was frightened	84.60467061834234
The women had already fled taking refuge in Vitry only a few men remained	595.5092882325738
On seeing the prince they hastened to meet him	22.00653334610842
Ah my lord he said have you come to drive away those rascal Spaniards and those Lorraine robbers	724.0953377023253
Yes said the prince if you will serve me as guide	66.2028466635885
Where does your highness wish to go	21.98302269249033
To some elevated spot whence I can look down on Lens and the surrounding country	189.96804821909882
In that case I m your man	250.76520405632004
I can trust youyou are a true Frenchman	213.5159285312658
I am an old soldier of Rocroy my lord	235.63044272192042
Here said the prince handing him a purse here is for Rocroy	329.5919622158956
Now do you want a horse or will you go afoot	263.00691661632095
Afoot my lord I have served always in the infantry	757.9023540627585
Besides I expect to lead your highness into places where you will have to walk	224.1897865982767
Come then said the prince let us lose no time	23.369361354261535
The peasant started off running before the princes horse then a hundred steps from the village he took a narrow road hidden at the bottom of the valley	104.51425830715102
For a half league they proceeded thus the cannonshot sounding so near that they expected at each discharge to hear the hum of the balls	402.0779132295232
At length they entered a path which going out from the road skirted the mountainside	418.399163740111
The prince dismounted ordered one of his aids and Raoul to follow his example and directed the others to await his orders keeping themselves meanwhile on the alert	219.3364703309438
He then began to ascend the path	38.940677530858274
In about ten minutes they reached the ruins of an old chateau those ruins crowned the summit of a hill which overlooked the surrounding country	386.7971173735531
At a distance of hardly a quarter of a league they looked down on Lens at bay and before Lens the enemys entire army	322.9322471238056
With a single glance the prince took in the extent of country that lay before him from Lens as far as Vimy	296.2085154449812
In a moment the plan of the battle which on the following day was to save France the second time from invasion was unrolled in his mind	112.29353162817193
He took a pencil tore a page from his tablets and wrote	119.69783457033246
My Dear MarshalIn an hour Lens will be in the enemys possession	314.74324021617997
Come and rejoin me bring with you the whole army	106.21895702108716
I shall be at Vendin to place it in position	236.663585386525
Tomorrow we shall retake Lens and beat the enemy	123.18325672018307
Then turning toward Raoul Go monsieur he said ride fast and give this letter to Monsieur de Grammont	148.5990710531155
Raoul bowed took the letter went hastily down the mountain leaped on his horse and set out at a gallop	113.74516563137409
A quarter of an hour later he was with the marshal	160.8001878839972
A portion of the troops had already arrived and the remainder was expected from moment to moment	172.93989525340535
Marshal de Grammont put himself at the head of all the available cavalry and infantry and took the road to Vendin leaving the Duc de Chatillon to await and bring on the rest	123.26979132381783
All the artillery was ready to move and started off at a moments notice	160.29355133989955
It was seven oclock in the evening when the marshal arrived at the appointed place	56.164891610026054
As he had foreseen Lens had fallen into the hands of the enemy immediately after Raouls departure	104.87052953099743
The event was announced by the cessation of the firing	125.63270382992297
As the shadows of night deepened the troops summoned by the prince arrived in successive detachments	1171.8344269163342
Orders were given that no drum should be beaten no trumpet sounded	1904.4294996076005
At nine oclock the night had fully come	324.878026482951
Still a last ray of twilight lighted the plain	474.4283600119116
The army marched silently the prince at the head of the column	85.90298181124766
Presently the army came in sight of Lens two or three houses were in flames and a dull noise was heard which indicated what suffering was endured by a town taken by assault	173.02657195945181
The prince assigned to every one his post	511.9702244862326
Marshal de Grammont was to hold the extreme left resting on Mericourt	1208.4638852541443
The Duc de Chatillon commanded the centre	62.38178361498808
Finally the prince led the right wing resting on Aunay	4850.16686623119
The order of battle on the morrow was to be that of the positions taken in the evening	124.59906362930711
Each one on awaking would find himself on the field of battle	40.440114165263914
The movement was executed in silence and with precision	147.77111212673594
At ten oclock every one was in his appointed position at halfpast ten the prince visited the posts and gave his final orders for the following day	148.1401299750743
Three things were especially urged upon the officers who were to see that the soldiers observed them scrupulously the first that the different corps should so march that cavalry and infantry should be on the same line and that each body should protect its gaps the second to go to the charge no faster than a walk the third to let the enemy fire first	303.83619651112883
The prince assigned the Count de Guiche to his father and kept Bragelonne near his own person but the two young men sought the privilege of passing the night together and it was accorded them	116.46379126765473
A tent was erected for them near that of the marshal	159.41726882298258
Although the day had been fatiguing neither of them was inclined to sleep	463.2517654354702
And besides even for old soldiers the evening before a battle is a serious time it was so with greater reason to two young men who were about to witness for the first time that terrible spectacle	79.28675637025678
On the evening before a battle one thinks of a thousand things forgotten till then those who are indifferent to one another become friends and those who are friends become brothers	240.42898017129144
It need not be said that if in the depths of the heart there is a sentiment more tender it reaches then quite naturally the highest exaltation of which it is capable	237.13686350523218
Some sentiment of this kind must have been cherished by each one of these two friends for each of them almost immediately sat down by himself at an end of the tent and began to write	70.66330499803247
The letters were longthe four pages were covered with closely written words	614.9403517044125
The writers sometimes looked up at each other and smiled they understood without speaking their organizations were so delicate and sympathetic	274.52934060621146
The letters being finished each put his own into two envelopes so that no one without tearing the first envelope could discover to whom the second was addressed then they drew near to each other and smilingly exchanged their letters	214.53362341178953
In case any evil should happen to me said Bragelonne	70.8052423553956
In case I should be killed said De Guiche	657.8294627488807
They then embraced each other like two brothers and each wrapping himself in his cloak they soon passed into that kindly sleep of youth which is the prerogative of birds flowers and infants	388.0821746435813
A Dinner in the Old Style	4320.824481372483
The second interview between the former musketeers was not so formal and threatening as the first	195.01072064880603
Athos with his superior understanding wisely deemed that the supper table would be the most complete and satisfactory point of reunion and at the moment when his friends in deference to his deportment and sobriety dared scarcely speak of some of their former good dinners he was the first to propose that they should all assemble around some well spread table and abandon themselves unreservedly to their own natural character and mannersa freedom which had formerly contributed so much to that good understanding between them which gave them the name of the inseparables	327.5535737036491
For different reasons this was an agreeable proposition to them all and it was therefore agreed that each should leave a very exact address and that upon the request of any of the associates a meeting should be convoked at a famous eating house in the Rue de la Monnaie of the sign of the Hermitage	169.4462145779068
The first rendezvous was fixed for the following Wednesday at eight oclock in the evening precisely	66.27792868093864
On that day in fact the four friends arrived punctually at the hour each from his own abode or occupation	162.03498307273205
Porthos had been trying a new horse DArtagnan was on guard at the Louvre Aramis had been to visit one of his penitents in the neighborhood and Athos whose domicile was established in the Rue Guenegaud found himself close at hand	195.25524376488195
They were therefore somewhat surprised to meet altogether at the door of the Hermitage Athos starting out from the Pont Neuf Porthos by the Rue de la Roule DArtagnan by the Rue des Fosse Saint Germain lAuxerrois and Aramis by the Rue de Bethisy	176.2086291269526
The first words exchanged between the four friends on account of the ceremony which each of them mingled with their demonstration were somewhat forced and even the repast began with a kind of stiffness	149.04884144128775
Athos perceived this embarrassment and by way of supplying an effectual remedy called for four bottles of champagne	700.5943059116954
At this order given in Athoss habitually calm manner the face of the Gascon relaxed and Porthoss brow grew smooth	1197.0039948972596
He knew that Athos not only never drank but more that he had a kind of repugnance to wine	117.90420964664983
This astonishment was doubled when Aramis saw Athos fill a bumper and toss it off with all his former enthusiasm	477.2339279723934
In a very few minutes the four bottles were empty and this excellent specific succeeded in dissipating even the slightest cloud that might have rested on their spirits	277.90535710269666
Now the four friends began to speak loud scarcely waiting till one had finished before another began and each assumed his favorite attitude on or at the table	371.48502082011817
Soonstrange factAramis undid two buttons of his doublet seeing which Porthos unfastened his entirely	735.1723302378916
Battles long journeys blows given and received sufficed for the first themes of conversation which turned upon the silent struggles sustained against him who was now called the great cardinal	282.36765901233673
Faith said Aramis laughing we have praised the dead enough let us revile the living a little I should like to say something evil of Mazarin is it permissible	395.2202187725552
Go on go on replied DArtagnan laughing heartily relate your story and I will applaud it if it is a good one	205.99577211331243
A great prince said Aramis with whom Mazarin sought an alliance was invited by him to send him a list of the conditions on which he would do him the honor to negotiate with him	108.62013952323986
The prince who had a great repugnance to treat with such an illbred fellow made out a list against the grain and sent it	322.56430956867956
In this list there were three conditions which displeased Mazarin and he offered the prince ten thousand crowns to renounce them	470.0507284581398
Ah ha ha laughed the three friends not a bad bargain and there was no fear of being taken at his word what did the prince do then	103.5814727244677
The prince immediately sent fifty thousand francs to Mazarin begging him never to write to him again and offered twenty thousand francs more on condition that he would never speak to him	67.6445715460555
You have guessed it answered Aramis and they all laughed so heartily that the host appeared in order to inquire whether the gentlemen wanted anything he thought they were fighting	266.883446639446
At last their hilarity calmed down and	26.33742909505573
Faith exclaimed DArtagnan to the two friends you may well wish ill to Mazarin for I assure you on his side he wishes you no good	174.88541856851353
If I thought the fellow knew me by my name I would be rebaptized for fear it might be thought I knew him	137.9707938517509
He knows you better by your actions than your name he is quite aware that there are two gentlemen who greatly aided the escape of Monsieur de Beaufort and he has instigated an active search for them I can answer for it	94.50474058196741
By me and this morning he sent for me to ask me if I had obtained any information	41.422298904065336
That I had none as yet but that I was to dine today with two gentlemen who would be able to give me some	46.535050421771906
You told him that said Porthos a broad smile spreading over his honest face	623.9846085800673
Bravo and you are not afraid of that Athos	205.01547967325814
No replied Athos it is not the search of Mazarin that I fear	105.17663823246909
Now said Aramis tell me a little what you do fear	151.5008896820962
Nothing for the present at least nothing in good earnest	432.019454635682
And with regard to the past asked Porthos	1102.6551420306491
Oh the past is another thing said Athos sighing the past and the future	254.81069067916468
Are you afraid for your young Raoul asked Aramis	1793.3047896469618
Well said DArtagnan one is never killed in a first engagement	210.78335092516178
Nor in the second said Aramis	11936.939105300515
Nor in the third returned Porthos and even when one is killed one rises again the proof of which is that here we are	239.32243754118232
No said Athos it is not Raoul about whom I am anxious for I trust he will conduct himself like a gentleman and if he is killedwell he will die bravely but holdshould such a misfortune happenwell Athos passed his hand across his pale brow	218.57603875363543
Well I shall look upon it as an expiation	154.55786091913686
Ah said DArtagnan I know what you mean	10.489529817163618
And I too added Aramis but you must not think of that Athos what is past is past	87.99968168246
I do nt understand said Porthos	849.4174019013616
The affair at Armentieres whispered DArtagnan	7944.242050541351
The affair at Armentieres asked he again	50.84838621524122
Oh yes said Porthos true I had forgotten it	49.32455953430235
You have forgotten it Porthos said he	11.291715162909668
Faith yes it is so long ago answered Porthos	790.5719979558846
This affair does not then weigh upon your conscience	288.9315617101061
II own that when my mind returns to that terrible period I have no recollection of anything but the rigid corpse of poor Madame Bonancieux	242.09883484138237
Yes yes murmured he I have often felt regret for the victim but never the very slightest remorse for the assassin	142.59573067996587
Consider said Aramis if you admit divine justice and its participation in the things of this world that woman was punished by the will of heaven	172.39303421144464
We were but the instruments that is all	53.3105146647691
But as to free will Aramis	113438.72006493737
How acts the judge He has a free will yet he fearlessly condemns	601.2949600196965
What does the executioner He is master of his arm yet he strikes without remorse	189.38158717248828
The executioner muttered Athos as if arrested by some recollection	255.7658276217602
I know that it is terrible said DArtagnan but when I reflect that we have killed English Rochellais Spaniards nay even French who never did us any other harm but to aim at and to miss us whose only fault was to cross swords with us and to be unable to ward off our blowsI can on my honor find an excuse for my share in the murder of that woman	279.0834338924732
As for me said Porthos now that you have reminded me of it Athos I have the scene again before me as if I now were there	99.8814878169237
Milady was there as it were where you sit	443.06329054493517
I wore a long sword which cut like a Damascusyou remember it Aramis for you always called it Balizarde	708.8733546051732
Well I swear to you all three that had the executioner of Bethunewas he not of Bethuneyes egad of Bethunenot been there I would have cut off the head of that infamous being without thinking of it or even after thinking of it	260.0725841364823
She was a most atrocious woman	147.49467258168855
And then said Aramis with the tone of philosophical indifference which he had assumed since he had belonged to the church and in which there was more atheism than confidence in God what is the use of thinking of it all At the last hour we must confess this action and God knows better than we can whether it is a crime a fault or a meritorious deed	92.38352889066411
I repent of it Egad no	565.1873388933175
Upon my honor and by the holy cross I only regret it because she was a woman	141.34664193796405
The most satisfactory part of the matter said DArtagnan is that there remains no trace of it	99.08351158955502
She had a son observed Athos	27782.630167524083
Oh yes I know that said DArtagnan and you mentioned it to me but who knows what has become of him If the serpent be dead why not its brood Do you think his uncle De Winter would have brought up that young viper De Winter probably condemned the son as he had done the mother	248.21452299102916
Then said Athos woe to De Winter for the child had done no harm	233.61279395134653
May the devil take me if the child be not dead said Porthos	137.88809827190093
There is so much fog in that detestable country at least so DArtagnan declares	461.4068743435611
Just as the quaint conclusion reached by Porthos was about to bring back hilarity to faces now more or less clouded hasty footsteps were heard upon the stair and some one knocked at the door	292.5882824119694
Please your honors said the host a person in a great hurry wishes to speak to one of you	119.96392438072785
To which of us asked all the four friends	108.09909015320778
To him who is called the Comte de la Fere	14.609081050080746
It is I said Athos and what is the name of the person	13.358386484617492
Back already What can have happened then to Bragelonne	840.8897792850802
Let him enter cried DArtagnan let him come up	22.553169977568718
But Grimaud had already mounted the staircase and was waiting on the last step so springing into the room he motioned the host to leave it	52.24468885937815
The door being closed the four friends waited in expectation	344.3491661106211
Grimauds agitation his pallor the sweat which covered his face the dust which soiled his clothes all indicated that he was the messenger of some important and terrible news	116.85357927196887
Your honors said he that woman had a child that child has become a man the tigress had a little one the tiger has roused himself he is ready to spring upon youbeware	356.2149954835788
Athos glanced around at his friends with a melancholy smile	28.403503731706312
Porthos turned to look at his sword which was hanging on the wall Aramis seized his knife DArtagnan arose	187.98960754875358
What do you mean Grimaud he exclaimed	80.07934989784111
That Miladys son has left England that he is in France on his road to Paris if he be not here already	92.13842101819152
The devil he is said Porthos	2479.3176941486763
This announcement was received in silence	381.73620414554574
Grimaud was so breathless so exhausted that he had fallen back upon a chair	42.102903100313604
Athos filled a beaker with champagne and gave it to him	64.30277192529768
Well after all said DArtagnan supposing that he lives that he comes to Paris we have seen many other such	127.81801043688789
Yes echoed Porthos glancing affectionately at his sword still hanging on the wall we can wait for him let him come	85.51059950490063
Moreover he is but a child said Aramis	160.45726505021906
Do you know what he has done this child Disguised as a monk he discovered the whole history in confession from the executioner of Bethune and having confessed him after having learned everything from him he gave him absolution by planting this dagger into his heart	231.0539482122274
See it is on fire yet with his hot blood for it is not thirty hours since it was drawn from the wound	84.64615947631982
And Grimaud threw the dagger on the table	5.908921161607012
DArtagnan Porthos and Aramis rose and in one spontaneous motion rushed to their swords	585.4215904113041
Athos alone remained seated calm and thoughtful	28.3413476867496
And you say he is dressed as a monk Grimaud	1619.3747528765657
About my height thin pale with light blue eyes and tawny flaxen hair	122.38561009480932
And he did not see Raoul asked Athos	1937.8813361245539
Yes on the contrary they met and it was the viscount himself who conducted him to the bed of the dying man	82.01159034681586
Athos in his turn rising without speaking went and unhooked his sword	636.8456498437616
Heigh sir said DArtagnan trying to laugh do you know we look very much like a flock of silly mouseevading women How is it that we four men who have faced armies without blinking begin to tremble at the mention of a child	211.94798779572255
It is true said Athos but this child comes in the name of Heaven	48.228196176094606
And very soon they left the inn	80.13927472819722
A Letter from Charles the First	21033.139848397605
The reader must now cross the Seine with us and follow us to the door of the Carmelite Convent in the Rue Saint Jacques	141.69218410639493
It is eleven oclock in the morning and the pious sisters have just finished saying mass for the success of the armies of King Charles I	154.9875793053408
Leaving the church a woman and a young girl dressed in black the one as a widow and the other as an orphan have reentered their cell	117.20689837864306
The woman kneels on a priedieu of painted wood and at a short distance from her stands the young girl leaning against a chair weeping	163.26063882752558
The woman must have once been handsome but traces of sorrow have aged her	581.2092966367526
The young girl is lovely and her tears only embellish her the lady appears to be about forty years of age the girl about fourteen	208.62727355911102
Oh God prayed the kneeling suppliant protect my husband guard my son and take my wretched life instead	544.1264042094505
Oh God murmured the girl leave me my mother	55.653727967892394
Your mother can be of no use to you in this world Henrietta said the lady turning around	97.48136591760623
Your mother has no longer either throne or husband she has neither son money nor friends the whole world my poor child has abandoned your mother And she fell back weeping into her daughters arms	197.1279727243843
Courage take courage my dear mother said the girl	27.218739701080942
Ah tis an unfortunate year for kings said the mother	209.5016203966991
And no one thinks of us in this country for each must think about his own affairs	95.54821128306449
As long as your brother was with me he kept me up but he is gone and can no longer send us news of himself either to me or to your father	75.79142927995382
I have pledged my last jewels sold your clothes and my own to pay his servants who refused to accompany him unless I made this sacrifice	185.36927281185703
We are now reduced to live at the expense of these daughters of Heaven we are the poor succored by God	144.54807047954506
But why not address yourself to your sister the queen asked the girl	71.83413583074059
Alas the queen my sister is no longer queen my child	149.46415435714576
One day you will be able to understand how all this is	23.732562509652624
Well then to the king your nephew	997.6001976270088
Shall I speak to him You know how much he loves me my mother	59.5059345363987
Alas my nephew is not yet king and you know Laporte has told us twenty times that he himself is in need of almost everything	231.7327983520727
Then let us pray to Heaven said the girl	198.0788306450507
The two women who thus knelt in united prayer were the daughter and granddaughter of Henry IV	731.4963255377617
the wife and daughter of Charles I	753.8297414223329
They had just finished their double prayer when a nun softly tapped at the door of the cell	394.1426568174717
Enter my sister said the queen	1074.9814343536652
I trust your majesty will pardon this intrusion on her meditations but a foreign lord has arrived from England and waits in the parlor demanding the honor of presenting a letter to your majesty	256.12749092001786
Oh a letter a letter from the king perhaps	143.60966812765676
News from your father do you hear Henrietta And the name of this lord	223.23859662795206
Lord de Winter exclaimed the queen the friend of my husband	206.45871331145727
And the queen advanced to meet the messenger whose hand she seized affectionately whilst he knelt down and presented a letter to her contained in a case of gold	169.09810470252376
Ah my lord said the queen you bring us three things which we have not seen for a long time	47.88221051707641
Gold a devoted friend and a letter from the king our husband and master	199.5849814509639
De Winter bowed again unable to reply from excess of emotion	134.3824728438157
On their side the mother and daughter retired into the embrasure of a window to read eagerly the following letter	186.23909522642387
Dear WifeWe have now reached the moment of decision	91.50665954162741
I have concentrated here at Naseby camp all the resources Heaven has left me and I write to you in haste from thence	262.64595512118046
Here I await the army of my rebellious subjects	297.6218524034585
I am about to struggle for the last time with them	36.94857978015688
If victorious I shall continue the struggle if beaten I am lost	500.97497029944464
I shall try in the latter case alas in our position one must provide for everything I shall try to gain the coast of France	197.79999655603615
But can they will they receive an unhappy king who will bring such a sad story into a country already agitated by civil discord Your wisdom and your affection must serve me as guides	434.0129398773971
The bearer of this letter will tell you madame what I dare not trust to pen and paper and the risks of transit	176.76557738420303
He will explain to you the steps that I expect you to pursue	80.8172531075244
I charge him also with my blessing for my children and with the sentiments of my soul for yourself my dearest sweetheart	197.93403516118195
The letter bore the signature not of Charles King but of Charlesstill king	1769.6662735739324
And let him be no longer king cried the queen	254.94452581926987
Let him be conquered exiled proscribed provided he still lives	6268.063967535289
Alas in these days the throne is too dangerous a place for me to wish him to retain it	94.77610863189345
But my lord tell me she continued hide nothing from mewhat is in truth the kings position Is it as hopeless as he thinks	403.96842749182974
Alas madame more hopeless than he thinks	253.61467140109718
His majesty has so good a heart that he can not understand hatred is so loyal that he does not suspect treason England is torn in twain by a spirit of disturbance which I greatly fear blood alone can exorcise	346.1341050540706
But Lord Montrose replied the queen I have heard of his great and rapid successes of battles gained	271.1171798960874
I heard it said that he was marching to the frontier to join the king	119.72975308049338
Yes madame but on the frontier he was met by Lesly he had tried victory by means of superhuman undertakings	515.9615134770733
Montrose beaten at Philiphaugh was obliged to disperse the remains of his army and to fly disguised as a servant	130.5180654939265
He is at Bergen in Norway	115841.58226445499
Heaven preserve him said the queen	651.0479763455547
It is at least a consolation to know that some who have so often risked their lives for us are safe	176.38609983873226
And now my lord that I see how hopeless the position of the king is tell me with what you are charged on the part of my royal husband	81.59910995193994
Well then madame said De Winter the king wishes you to try and discover the dispositions of the king and queen toward him	157.38136865569652
Alas you know that even now the king is but a child and the queen a woman weak enough	121.40639894588342
Does he desire to play the part in France that Cromwell plays in England	494.4942273680708
Oh no He is a subtle conscienceless Italian who though he very likely dreams of crime dares not commit it and unlike Cromwell who disposes of both Houses Mazarin has had the queen to support him in his struggle with the parliament	584.5218490381545
More reason then he should protect a king pursued by parliament	882.7629600265877
The queen shook her head despairingly	110257.9151320398
If I judge for myself my lord she said the cardinal will do nothing and will even perhaps act against us	129.92526112069467
The presence of my daughter and myself in France is already irksome to him much more so would be that of the king	129.3791411653119
My lord added Henrietta with a melancholy smile it is sad and almost shameful to be obliged to say that we have passed the winter in the Louvre without money without linen almost without bread and often not rising from bed because we wanted fire	166.59031143622036
Horrible cried De Winter the daughter of Henry IV	145.88712940499948
and the wife of King Charles Wherefore did you not apply then madame to the first person you saw from us	173.06598746495376
Such is the hospitality shown to a queen by the minister from whom a king demands it	153.2452170444667
But I heard that a marriage between the Prince of Wales and Mademoiselle dOrleans was spoken of said De Winter	333.88010706110566
Yes for an instant I hoped it was so	113.77520859309725
The young people felt a mutual esteem but the queen who at first sanctioned their affection changed her mind and Monsieur the Duc dOrleans who had encouraged the familiarity between them has forbidden his daughter to think any more about the union	427.35175686267485
Oh my lord continued the queen without restraining her tears it is better to fight as the king has done and to die as perhaps he will than live in beggary like me	272.467808683889
Courage madame courage Do not despair The interests of the French crown endangered at this moment are to discountenance rebellion in a neighboring nation	415.7880280158452
Mazarin as a statesman will understand the politic necessity	1981.5877665669482
Are you sure said the queen doubtfully that you have not been forestalled	269.9577832078153
By the Joices the Prinns the Cromwells	2165.6549153491587
By a tailor a coachmaker a brewer Ah I hope madame that the cardinal will not enter into negotiations with such men	281.52365916114627
Ah what is he himself asked Madame Henrietta	316.8042301117515
But for the honor of the kingof the queen	573.0641622137383
Well let us hope he will do something for the sake of their honor said the queen	48.7011228656653
A true friends eloquence is so powerful my lord that you have reassured me	64.0852022860748
Give me your hand and let us go to the minister and yet she added suppose he should refuse and that the king loses the battle	135.33500620522153
His majesty will then take refuge in Holland where I hear his highness the Prince of Wales now is	258.1744690414714
And can his majesty count upon many such subjects as yourself for his flight	270.7029688932582
Alas no madame answered De Winter but the case is provided for and I am come to France to seek allies	145.65394803450346
Allies said the queen shaking her head	8.228068332944147
Madame replied De Winter provided I can find some of my good old friends of former times I will answer for anything	110.35795233380715
Come then my lord said the queen with the painful doubt that is felt by those who have suffered much come and may Heaven hear you	152.45485671480145
At the very moment when the queen quitted the convent to go to the Palais Royal a young man dismounted at the gate of this royal abode and announced to the guards that he had something of importance to communicate to Cardinal Mazarin	107.1813376322263
Although the cardinal was often tormented by fear he was more often in need of counsel and information and he was therefore sufficiently accessible	289.3540666461245
The true difficulty of being admitted was not to be found at the first door and even the second was passed easily enough but at the third watched besides the guard and the doorkeepers the faithful Bernouin a Cerberus whom no speech could soften no wand even of gold could charm	384.8881484194017
It was therefore at the third door that those who solicited or were bidden to an audience underwent their formal interrogatory	1181.6704144256025
The young man having left his horse tied to the gate in the court mounted the great staircase and addressed the guard in the first chamber	69.38814372860915
The cavalier entered the second hall which was guarded by the musketeers and doorkeepers	213.18662329875502
Have you a letter of audience asked a porter advancing to the new arrival	257.09560508186536
I have one but not one from Cardinal Mazarin	588.4377881702221
Enter and ask for Monsieur Bernouin said the porter opening the door of the third room	48.574781006685086
Whether he only held his usual post or whether it was by accident Monsieur Bernouin was found standing behind the door and must have heard all that had passed	110.03437962403181
You seek me sir said he	26.81108706309108
From whom may the letter be you bear to his eminence	422.535014351659
From General Oliver Cromwell said the new comer	794.5170253319646
Be so good as to mention this name to his eminence and to bring me word whether he will receive meyes or no	216.7535082920065
Saying which he resumed the proud and sombre bearing peculiar at that time to Puritans	668.4994775175493
Bernouin cast an inquisitorial glance at the person of the young man and entered the cabinet of the cardinal to whom he transmitted the messengers words	82.51626414599822
A man bringing a letter from Oliver Cromwell said Mazarin	1468.8358225415461
And what kind of a man	12.448569666137416
Hair sandyredmore red than sandy grayblue eyesmore gray than blue and for the rest stiff and proud	359.19338697527314
Let him give in his letter	1352.4550055526786
His eminence asks for the letter said Bernouin passing back into the antechamber	297.5029107925635
His eminence can not see the letter without the bearer of it replied the young man but to convince you that I am really the bearer of a letter see here it is and kindly add continued he that I am not a simple messenger but an envoy extraordinary	133.08994530906511
Bernouin reentered the cabinet returning in a few seconds	19.44538203045326
The young man appeared on the threshold of the ministers closet in one hand holding his hat in the other the letter	64.0459172035643
Have you sir asked he a letter accrediting you to me	302.98842764375956
There it is my lord said the young man	4.8883981109707415
Mazarin took the letter and read it thus	56.67217452109549
Mordaunt one of my secretaries will remit this letter of introduction to His Eminence the Cardinal Mazarin in Paris	453.7320277531961
He is also the bearer of a second confidential epistle for his eminence	307.5026688258509
Very well Monsieur Mordaunt said Mazarin give me this second letter and sit down	199.55541103043157
The young man drew from his pocket a second letter presented it to the cardinal and took his seat	35.483339334403674
The cardinal however did not unseal the letter at once but continued to turn it again and again in his hand then in accordance with his usual custom and judging from experience that few people could hide anything from him when he began to question them fixing his eyes upon them at the same time he thus addressed the messenger	111.38987452667776
You are very young Monsieur Mordaunt for this difficult task of ambassador in which the oldest diplomatists often fail	743.1618511774083
My lord I am twentythree years of age but your eminence is mistaken in saying that I am young	64.96158920263815
I am older than your eminence although I possess not your wisdom	237.93389532670014
Years of suffering in my opinion count double and I have suffered for twenty years	86.48129974346992
Ah yes I understand said Mazarin want of fortune perhaps	2158.8813361988023
You are poor are you not Then he added to himself These English Revolutionists are all beggars and illbred	444.00101444367004
My lord I ought to have a fortune of six millions but it has been taken from me	30.154468356407342
You are not then a man of the people said Mazarin astonished	194.36762914911023
If I bore my proper title I should be a lord	97.28014570686562
If I bore my name you would have heard one of the most illustrious names of England	43.17957220844658
What is your name then asked Mazarin	162.42185066798638
My name is Mordaunt replied the young man bowing	16.813075065633637
Mazarin now understood that Cromwells envoy desired to retain his incognito	1704.1371260665535
He was silent for an instant and during that time he scanned the young man even more attentively than he had done at first	67.60513748820328
Devil take these Puritans said Mazarin aside they are carved from granite	914.567742248932
Then he added aloud But you have relations left you	169.65434032083334
Three times I presented myself to ask his support and three times he ordered his servants to turn me away	115.49823814923414
Oh mon Dieu my dear Mr	31921.66922581496
Mordaunt said Mazarin hoping by a display of affected pity to catch the young man in a snare how extremely your history interests me You know not then anything of your birthyou have never seen your mother	196.40613891888162
Yes my lord she came three times whilst I was a child to my nurses house I remember the last time she came as well as if it were today	111.08690183789746
You have a good memory said Mazarin	117.72537655318204
Oh yes my lord said the young man with such peculiar emphasis that the cardinal felt a shudder run through every vein	132.10783575322725
And who brought you up he asked again	151.31227691215364
A French nurse who sent me away when I was five years old because no one paid her for me telling me the name of a relation of whom she had heard my mother often speak	78.66654799016916
As I was weeping and begging on the high road a minister from Kingston took me in instructed me in the Calvinistic faith taught me all he knew himself and aided me in my researches after my family	366.93211563130427
You discovered what had become of your mother	60.02016728646893
I learned that she had been assassinated by my relation aided by four friends but I was already aware that I had been robbed of my wealth and degraded from my nobility by King Charles I	162.9041812455391
Oh I now understand why you are in the service of Cromwell you hate the king	96.63863154775872
Yes my lord I hate him said the young man	9.17404767987745
Mazarin marked with surprise the diabolical expression with which the young man uttered these words	49.324481331086545
Just as ordinarily faces are colored by blood his face seemed dyed by hatred and became livid	290.99656182603076
Your history is a terrible one Mr	3529.1043775566563
Mordaunt and touches me keenly but happily for you you serve an allpowerful master he ought to aid you in your search we have so many means of gaining information	173.40877887699958
My lord to a wellbred dog it is only necessary to show one end of a track he is certain to reach the other	111.84378530891603
But this relation you mentioneddo you wish me to speak to him said Mazarin who was anxious to make a friend about Cromwells person	82.29726316898645
Thanks my lord I will speak to him myself	33.882816641238534
He will treat me better the next time I see him	37.701866458152516
You have the means then of touching him	358.73932693598243
I have the means of making myself feared	306.44909031448253
Mazarin looked at the young man but at the fire which shot from his glance he bent his head then embarrassed how to continue such a conversation he opened Cromwells letter	175.413133219902
The young mans eyes gradually resumed their dull and glassy appearance and he fell into a profound reverie	182.85412249421807
After reading the first lines of the letter Mazarin gave a side glance at him to see if he was watching the expression of his face as he read	50.467933386063216
Observing his indifference he shrugged his shoulders saying	57.25722169910109
Send on your business those who do theirs at the same time Let us see what this letter contains	93.1268271200271
We here present the letter verbatim	518059.560934849
To his Eminence Monseigneur le Cardinal Mazarini	9689.034277436345
I have wished monseigneur to learn your intentions relating to the existing state of affairs in England	180.30080224172357
The two kingdoms are so near that France must be interested in our situation as we are interested in that of France	97.05940260035929
The English are almost of one mind in contending against the tyranny of Charles and his adherents	501.62857660996826
Placed by popular confidence at the head of that movement I can appreciate better than any other its significance and its probable results	221.18398039140342
I am at present in the midst of war and am about to deliver a decisive battle against King Charles	278.62192033984235
I shall gain it for the hope of the nation and the Spirit of the Lord are with me	140.18240823061112
This battle won by me the king will have no further resources in England or in Scotland and if he is not captured or killed he will endeavor to pass over into France to recruit soldiers and to refurnish himself with arms and money	218.6351968926197
France has already received Queen Henrietta and unintentionally doubtless has maintained a centre of inextinguishable civil war in my country	545.8059698379055
But Madame Henrietta is a daughter of France and was entitled to the hospitality of France	64.16319980818585
As to King Charles the question must be viewed differently in receiving and aiding him France will censure the acts of the English nation and thus so essentially harm England and especially the wellbeing of the government that such a proceeding will be equivalent to pronounced hostilities	556.4766045290286
At this moment Mazarin became very uneasy at the turn which the letter was taking and paused to glance under his eyes at the young man	71.8446206700852
It is important therefore monseigneur that I should be informed as to the intentions of France	42.6397505183355
The interests of that kingdom and those of England though taking now diverse directions are very nearly the same	387.77031143071616
England needs tranquillity at home in order to consummate the expulsion of her king France needs tranquillity to establish on solid foundations the throne of her young monarch	530.2125797504962
You need as much as we do that interior condition of repose which thanks to the energy of our government we are about to attain	228.554630733734
Your quarrels with the parliament your noisy dissensions with the princes who fight for you today and tomorrow will fight against you the popular following directed by the coadjutor President Blancmesnil and Councillor Brousselall that disorder in short which pervades the several departments of the state must lead you to view with uneasiness the possibility of a foreign war for in that event England exalted by the enthusiasm of new ideas will ally herself with Spain already seeking that alliance	543.5225428935962
I have therefore believed monseigneur knowing your prudence and your personal relation to the events of the present time that you will choose to hold your forces concentrated in the interior of the French kingdom and leave to her own the new government of England	141.57359942891105
That neutrality consists simply in excluding King Charles from the territory of France and in refraining from helping hima stranger to your countrywith arms with money or with troops	807.0394305703547
My letter is private and confidential and for that reason I send it to you by a man who shares my most intimate counsels	127.11467318614002
It anticipates through a sentiment which your eminence will appreciate measures to be taken after the events	291.07787668520564
Oliver Cromwell considered it more expedient to declare himself to a mind as intelligent as Mazarins than to a queen admirable for firmness without doubt but too much guided by vain prejudices of birth and of divine right	422.7665138495854
Farewell monseigneur should I not receive a reply in the space of fifteen days I shall presume my letter will have miscarried	210.92474968209095
Mordaunt said the cardinal raising his voice as if to arouse the dreamer my reply to this letter will be more satisfactory to General Cromwell if I am convinced that all are ignorant of my having given one go therefore and await it at BoulognesurMer and promise me to set out tomorrow morning	170.15248215095687
I promise my lord replied Mordaunt but how many days does your eminence expect me to await your reply	271.12668968663905
If you do not receive it in ten days you can leave	52.85726145918361
That is not all sir continued Mazarin your private adventures have touched me to the quick besides the letter from Mr	490.2169122441529
Cromwell makes you an important person as ambassador come tell me what can I do for you	221.8250418818984
Mordaunt reflected a moment and after some hesitation was about to speak when Bernouin entered hastily and bending down to the ear of the cardinal whispered	179.0963254064605
My lord the Queen Henrietta Maria accompanied by an English noble is entering the Palais Royal at this moment	199.72388447644386
Mazarin made a bound from his chair which did not escape the attention of the young man and suppressed the confidence he was about to make	35.92077497708256
Sir said the cardinal you have heard me I fix on Boulogne because I presume that every town in France is indifferent to you if you prefer another name it but you can easily conceive that surrounded as I am by influences I can only muzzle by discretion I desire your presence in Paris to be unknown	196.09648916148058
I go sir said Mordaunt advancing a few steps to the door by which he had entered	24.50944424795073
No not that way I beg sir quickly exclaimed the cardinal be so good as to pass by yonder gallery by which you can regain the hall	227.59052527810448
I do not wish you to be seen leaving our interview must be kept secret	260.46185720756444
Mordaunt followed Bernouin who led him through the adjacent chamber and left him with a doorkeeper showing him the way out	97.7082734171253
The cardinal rose and advanced in haste to receive the queen of England	65.10305418007985
He showed the more respect to this queen deprived of every mark of pomp and stripped of followers as he felt some selfreproach for his own want of heart and his avarice	360.23938837491187
But supplicants for favor know how to accommodate the expression of their features and the daughter of Henry IV	87.55960230652529
smiled as she advanced to meet a man she hated and despised	330.4072686044234
Ah said Mazarin to himself what a sweet face does she come to borrow money of me	180.54224116994544
And he threw an uneasy glance at his strong box he even turned inside the bevel of the magnificent diamond ring the brilliancy of which drew every eye upon his hand which indeed was white and handsome	177.09997589461665
Your eminence said the august visitor it was my first intention to speak of the matters that have brought me here to the queen my sister but I have reflected that political affairs are more especially the concern of men	114.27258196452838
Madame said Mazarin your majesty overwhelms me with flattering distinction	1439.600404576451
He is very gracious thought the queen can he have guessed my errand	300.6350477038148
Give continued the cardinal your commands to the most respectful of your servants	79.68824792989824
Alas sir replied the queen I have lost the habit of commanding and have adopted instead that of making petitions	189.5912012582668
I am here to petition you too happy should my prayer be favorably heard	509.53033056124656
I am listening madame with the greatest interest said Mazarin	144.10099626605256
Your eminence it concerns the war which the king my husband is now sustaining against his rebellious subjects	558.8980786082598
You are perhaps ignorant that they are fighting in England added she with a melancholy smile and that in a short time they will fight in a much more decided fashion than they have done hitherto	89.7480837252199
I am completely ignorant of it madame said the cardinal accompanying his words with a slight shrug of the shoulders alas our own wars quite absorb the time and the mind of a poor incapable infirm old minister like me	235.38135904175138
Well then your eminence said the queen I must inform you that Charles I	93.19646804458343
my husband is on the eve of a decisive engagement	178.18317190209024
In case of a check Mazarin made a slight movement one must foresee everything in the case of a check he desires to retire into France and to live here as a private individual	187.8987225652551
What do you say to this project	356.0150690329947
The cardinal had listened without permitting a single fibre of his face to betray what he felt and his smile remained as it ever wasfalse and flattering and when the queen finished speaking he said	264.390791988713
Do you think madame that France agitated and disturbed as it is would be a safe retreat for a dethroned king How will the crown which is scarce firmly set on the head of Louis XIV	362.39218791214006
The weight was not so heavy when I was in peril interrupted the queen with a sad smile and I ask no more for my husband than has been done for me you see that we are very humble monarchs sir	105.95297759666434
Oh you madame the cardinal hastened to say in order to cut short the explanation he foresaw was coming with regard to you that is another thing	181.61887947075533
of that great that sublime sovereign	4808.987877456959
All which does not prevent you refusing hospitality to his soninlaw sir Nevertheless you ought to remember that that great that sublime monarch when proscribed at one time as my husband may be demanded aid from England and England accorded it to him and it is but just to say that Queen Elizabeth was not his niece	377.80017753011475
Peccato said Mazarin writhing beneath this simple eloquence your majesty does not understand me you judge my intentions wrongly and that is partly because doubtless I explain myself in French	355.2102221488466
Ere the cardinal your predecessor sent our mother Marie de Medicis to die in exile she taught us that language	884.9060601743536
If anything yet remains of that great that sublime king Henry of whom you have just spoken he would be much surprised at so little pity for his family being united to such a profound admiration of himself	200.82431855908368
The perspiration stood in large drops on Mazarins brow	578.9966625257805
That admiration is on the contrary so great so real madame returned Mazarin without noticing the change of language offered to him by the queen that if the king Charles I	173.13279261242536
whom Heaven protect from evilcame into France I would offer him my housemy own house but alas it would be but an unsafe retreat	261.86117106311156
Some day the people will burn that house as they burned that of the Marechal dAncre	596.9537467666687
Poor Concino Concini And yet he but desired the good of the people	167.32220031612914
Yes my lord like yourself said the queen ironically	350.74803357095425
Mazarin pretended not to understand the double meaning of his own sentence but continued to compassionate the fate of Concino Concini	270.89409908428206
Well then your eminence said the queen becoming impatient what is your answer	208.93519510385798
Madame cried Mazarin more and more moved will your majesty permit me to give you counsel	189.20210898253168
Speak sir replied the queen the counsels of so prudent a man as yourself ought certainly to be available	191.31166884365237
Madame believe me the king ought to defend himself to the last	35.61812957033093
He has done so sir and this last battle which he encounters with resources much inferior to those of the enemy proves that he will not yield without a struggle but in case he is beaten	214.50007625725777
Well madame in that case my adviceI know that I am very bold to offer advice to your majestymy advice is that the king should not leave his kingdom	209.53373928362564
Absent kings are very soon forgotten if he passes over into France his cause is lost	303.01350295336147
But persisted the queen if such be your advice and you have his interest at heart send him help of men and money for I can do nothing for him I have sold even to my last diamond to aid him	127.91074349372943
If I had had a single ornament left I should have bought wood this winter to make a fire for my daughter and myself	335.0627230104791
Oh madame said Mazarin your majesty knows not what you ask	161.94660523338945
On the day when foreign succor follows in the train of a king to replace him on his throne it is an avowal that he no longer possesses the help and love of his own subjects	135.01226013453362
To the point sir said the queen to the point and answer me yes or no if the king persists in remaining in England will you send him succor If he comes to France will you accord him hospitality What do you intend to do Speak	228.2845675838552
Madame said the cardinal affecting an effusive frankness of speech I shall convince your majesty I trust of my devotion to you and my desire to terminate an affair which you have so much at heart	130.46513428883085
After which your majesty will I think no longer doubt my zeal in your behalf	121.61045270315418
The queen bit her lips and moved impatiently on her chair	97.89218066318378
Well what do you propose to do she said at length come speak	104.76017337206893
I will go this instant and consult the queen and we will refer the affair at once to parliament	204.04357688601107
With which you are at waris it not so You will charge Broussel to report it	924.3734532948015
I understand you or rather I am wrong	31.97689921095047
Go to the parliament for it was from this parliament the enemy of monarchs that the daughter of the great the sublime Henry IV	193.00168029387345
whom you so much admire received the only relief this winter which prevented her from dying of hunger and cold	258.87602868720126
And with these words Henrietta rose in majestic indignation whilst the cardinal raising his hands clasped toward her exclaimed Ah madame madame how little you know me mon Dieu	505.92367949098355
But Queen Henrietta without even turning toward him who made these hypocritical pretensions crossed the cabinet opened the door for herself and passing through the midst of the cardinals numerous guards courtiers eager to pay homage the luxurious show of a competing royalty she went and took the hand of De Winter who stood apart in isolation	376.8472849244037
Poor queen already fallen Though all bowed before her as etiquette required she had now but a single arm on which she could lean	230.22452218205825
It signifies little said Mazarin when he was alone	40.49225376803155
It gave me pain and it was an ungracious part to play but I have said nothing either to the one or to the other	105.14778575254508
See if the young man with the black doublet and the short hair who was with me just now is still in the palace	111.56598654007502
Bernouin went out and soon returned with Comminges who was on guard	126.90520144128519
Your eminence said Comminges as I was reconducting the young man for whom you have asked he approached the glass door of the gallery and gazed intently upon some object doubtless the picture by Raphael which is opposite the door	120.76411586593565
He reflected for a second and then descended the stairs	80.83676730133301
I believe I saw him mount a gray horse and leave the palace court	409.94424348887793
But is not your eminence going to the queen	140.77646356957956
Monsieur de Guitant my uncle has just told me that her majesty had received news of the army	63.43962277820256
It is well I will go	28.034269362532974
Comminges had seen rightly and Mordaunt had really acted as he had related	285.7349953088579
In crossing the gallery parallel to the large glass gallery he perceived De Winter who was waiting until the queen had finished her negotiation	220.8382125367701
At this sight the young man stopped short not in admiration of Raphaels picture but as if fascinated at the sight of some terrible object	221.27908210901637
His eyes dilated and a shudder ran through his body	136.07647824494515
One would have said that he longed to break through the wall of glass which separated him from his enemy for if Comminges had seen with what an expression of hatred the eyes of this young man were fixed upon De Winter he would not have doubted for an instant that the Englishman was his eternal foe	113.87794395406439
But he stopped doubtless to reflect for instead of allowing his first impulse which had been to go straight to Lord de Winter to carry him away he leisurely descended the staircase left the palace with his head down mounted his horse which he reined in at the corner of the Rue Richelieu and with his eyes fixed on the gate waited until the queens carriage had left the court	105.66297091812706
He had not long to wait for the queen scarcely remained a quarter of an hour with Mazarin but this quarter of an hour of expectation appeared a century to him	96.53672006287874
At last the heavy machine which was called a chariot in those days came out rumbling against the gates and De Winter still on horseback bent again to the door to converse with her majesty	202.89218569461914
The horses started on a trot and took the road to the Louvre which they entered	62.27053065572377
Before leaving the convent of the Carmelites Henrietta had desired her daughter to attend her at the palace which she had inhabited for a long time and which she had only left because their poverty seemed to them more difficult to bear in gilded chambers	158.0570281396009
Mordaunt followed the carriage and when he had watched it drive beneath the sombre arches he went and stationed himself under a wall over which the shadow was extended and remained motionless amidst the moldings of Jean Goujon like a basrelievo representing an equestrian statue	306.441037718806
How sometimes the Unhappy mistake Chance for Providence	2334.7254120847224
Well madame said De Winter when the queen had dismissed her attendants	196.081016632895
Well my lord what I foresaw has come to pass	344.09494939251283
What does the cardinal refuse to receive the king France refuse hospitality to an unfortunate prince Ay but it is for the first time madame	226.80927591178815
I did not say France my lord I said the cardinal and the cardinal is not even a Frenchman	76.75367937326902
But did you see the queen	757.3594607496424
It is useless replied Henrietta the queen will not say yes when the cardinal says no	153.0818376520772
Are you not aware that this Italian directs everything both indoors and out And moreover I should not be surprised had we been forestalled by Cromwell	521.841841793221
He was embarrassed whilst speaking to me and yet quite firm in his determination to refuse	92.98922149798783
Then did you not observe the agitation in the Palais Royal the passing to and fro of busy people Can they have received any news my lord	306.23678755766923
I made such haste that I am certain of not having been forestalled	92.36706038926066
I set out three days ago passing miraculously through the Puritan army and I took post horses with my servant Tony the horses upon which we were mounted were bought in Paris	331.0553422885644
Besides the king I am certain awaits your majestys reply before risking anything	2056.1425908989054
You will tell him my lord resumed the queen despairingly that I can do nothing that I have suffered as much as himselfmore than he hasobliged as I am to eat the bread of exile and to ask hospitality from false friends who smile at my tears and as regards his royal person he must sacrifice it generously and die like a king	239.27229243561052
I shall go and die by his side	65.32745323191588
Madame madame exclaimed De Winter your majesty abandons yourself to despair and yet perhaps there still remains some hope	292.99204779889766
No friends left my lord no other friends left in the wide world but yourself Oh God exclaimed the poor queen raising her eyes to Heaven have You indeed taken back all the generous hearts that once existed in the world	217.56156610709155
I hope not madame replied De Winter thoughtfully I once spoke to you of four men	145.01627060276363
What can be done with four	3573.937425299196
Four devoted resolute men can do much assure yourself madame and those of whom I speak performed great things at one time	196.3601937464394
And where are these four men	15.986928681935987
Ah that is what I do not know	7.432836473895442
It is twenty years since I saw them and yet whenever I have seen the king in danger I have thought of them	63.932105065281014
And these men were your friends	144.8222689718331
One of them held my life in his hands and gave it to me	19.20943274291054
I know not whether he is still my friend but since that time I have remained his	55.813996498297485
And these men are in France my lord	41.71054846330607
Tell me their names perhaps I may have heard them mentioned and might be able to aid you in finding them	64.94877581658298
One of them was called the Chevalier dArtagnan	992.3429466790703
Ah my lord if I mistake not the Chevalier dArtagnan is lieutenant of royal guards but take care for I fear that this man is entirely devoted to the cardinal	174.44657437948075
That would be a misfortune said De Winter and I shall begin to think that we are really doomed	89.33965630777058
But the others said the queen who clung to this last hope as a shipwrecked man clings to the hull of his vessel	197.23353383868343
The secondI heard his name by chance for before fighting us these four gentlemen told us their names the second was called the Comte de la Fere	168.54304914452686
As for the two others I had so much the habit of calling them by nicknames that I have forgotten their real ones	144.25902832546387
Oh mon Dieu it is a matter of the greatest urgency to find them out said the queen since you think these worthy gentlemen might be so useful to the king	116.32554261214774
Oh yes said De Winter for they are the same men	101.23481979800118
Listen madame and recall your remembrances	33652.140363678576
Have you never heard that Queen Anne of Austria was once saved from the greatest danger ever incurred by a queen	251.7937875849681
Yes at the time of her relations with Monsieur de Buckingham it had to do in some way with certain studs and diamonds	346.8747879738412
Well it was that affair madame these men are the ones who saved her and I smile with pity when I reflect that if the names of those gentlemen are unknown to you it is because the queen has forgotten them who ought to have made them the first noblemen of the realm	103.26202712207184
Well then my lord they must be found but what can four men or rather three men dofor I tell you you must not count on Monsieur dArtagnan	165.12122441891162
It will be one valiant sword the less but there will remain still three without reckoning my own now four devoted men around the king to protect him from his enemies to be at his side in battle to aid him with counsel to escort him in flight are sufficient not to make the king a conqueror but to save him if conquered and whatever Mazarin may say once on the shores of France your royal husband may find as many retreats and asylums as the seabird finds in a storm	285.98133185899195
Seek then my lord seek these gentlemen and if they will consent to go with you to England I will give to each a duchy the day that we reascend the throne besides as much gold as would pave Whitehall	231.81748077105564
Seek them my lord and find them I conjure you	205.76898205644022
I will search for them madame said De Winter and doubtless I shall find them but time fails me	165.06262675029183
Has your majesty forgotten that the king expects your reply and awaits it in agony	349.70401851167907
Then indeed we are lost cried the queen in the fullness of a broken heart	101.45646451338581
At this moment the door opened and the young Henrietta appeared then the queen with that wonderful strength which is the privilege of parents repressed her tears and motioned to De Winter to change the subject	188.61541128816856
But that act of selfcontrol effective as it was did not escape the eyes of the young princess	67.78334769458468
She stopped on the threshold breathed a sigh and addressing the queen	222.5239977399347
Why then do you always weep mother when I am away from you she said	158.94618574814479
The queen smiled but instead of answering	96.62011534948402
See De Winter she said I have at least gained one thing in being only half a queen and that is that my children call me mother instead of madame	129.04414650221347
What do you want Henrietta she demanded	328.1860819358819
My mother replied the young princess a cavalier has just entered the Louvre and wishes to present his respects to your majesty he arrives from the army and has he says a letter to remit to you on the part of the Marechal de Grammont I think	107.1689001477476
Ah said the queen to De Winter he is one of my faithful adherents but do you not observe my dear lord that we are so poorly served that it is left to my daughter to fill the office of doorkeeper	169.03860604512354
Madame have pity on me exclaimed De Winter you wring my heart	391.21422937162583
And who is this cavalier Henrietta asked the queen	254.48950885322935
I saw him from the window madame he is a young man that appears scarce sixteen years of age and is called the Viscount de Bragelonne	124.75976535540251
The queen smiling made a sign with her head the young princess opened the door and Raoul appeared on the threshold	29.934410088919837
Advancing a few steps toward the queen he knelt down	103.51643824204075
Madame said he I bear to your majesty a letter from my friend the Count de Guiche who told me he had the honor of being your servant this letter contains important news and the expression of his respect	74.34547949734865
At the name of the Count de Guiche a blush spread over the cheeks of the young princess and the queen glanced at her with some degree of severity	68.87866186642394
You told me that the letter was from the Marechal de Grammont Henrietta said the queen	229.94522246956765
I thought so madame stammered the young girl	6.801166565232011
It is my fault madame said Raoul	159.7105469843225
I did announce myself in truth as coming on the part of the Marechal de Grammont but being wounded in the right arm he was unable to write and therefore the Count de Guiche acted as his secretary	132.7578984094932
There has been fighting then asked the queen motioning to Raoul to rise	283.28687764133383
Yes madame said the young man	1.860046366488732
At this announcement of a battle having taken place the princess opened her mouth as though to ask a question of interest but her lips closed again without articulating a word while the color gradually faded from her cheeks	196.24358996301947
The queen saw this and doubtless her maternal heart translated the emotion for addressing Raoul again	1232.0252167063522
And no evil has happened to the young Count de Guiche she asked for not only is he our servant as you say sir but morehe is one of our friends	134.85790241019586
No madame replied Raoul on the contrary he gained great glory and had the honor of being embraced by his highness the prince on the field of battle	67.66390624999195
The young princess clapped her hands and then ashamed of having been betrayed into such a demonstration of joy she half turned away and bent over a vase of roses as if to inhale their odor	171.1727118997978
Let us see said the queen what the count says	208.4138162044285
And she opened the letter and read	22.273064032973853
MadameBeing unable to have the honor of writing to you myself by reason of a wound I have received in my right hand I have commanded my son the Count de Guiche who with his father is equally your humble servant to write to tell you that we have just gained the battle of Lens and that this victory can not fail to give great power to Cardinal Mazarin and to the queen over the affairs of Europe	86.77989679718814
If her majesty will have faith in my counsels she ought to profit by this event to address at this moment in favor of her august husband the court of France	144.68717058570854
The Vicomte de Bragelonne who will have the honor of remitting this letter to your majesty is the friend of my son who owes to him his life he is a gentleman in whom your majesty may confide entirely in case your majesty may have some verbal or written order to remit to me	104.22382631842726
I have the honor to be with respect etc	1590.6778406426745
At the moment mention occurred of his having rendered a service to the count Raoul could not help turning his glance toward the young princess and then he saw in her eyes an expression of infinite gratitude to the young man he no longer doubted that the daughter of King Charles I	72.93515996567626
The battle of Lens gained said the queen they are lucky here indeed they can gain battles Yes the Marechal de Grammont is right this will change the aspect of French affairs but I much fear it will do nothing for English even if it does not harm them	248.4129813615799
This is recent news sir continued she and I thank you for having made such haste to bring it to me without this letter I should not have heard till tomorrow perhaps after tomorrowthe last of all Paris	117.60528313680972
Madame said Raoul the Louvre is but the second palace this news has reached it is as yet unknown to all and I had sworn to the Count de Guiche to remit this letter to your majesty before even I should embrace my guardian	126.27498650720986
Your guardian is he too a Bragelonne asked Lord de Winter	1129.401028272653
I once knew a Bragelonneis he still alive	732.5370406951679
No sir he is dead and I believe it is from him my guardian whose near relation he was inherited the estate from which I take my name	233.7209050544588
And your guardian sir asked the queen who could not help feeling some interest in the handsome young man before her what is his name	108.26612812118917
The Comte de la Fere madame replied the young man bowing	45.866384023131516
De Winter made a gesture of surprise and the queen turned to him with a start of joy	30.61716511899713
The Comte de la Fere she cried	93.43627058366987
Have you not mentioned that name to me	22.645619360020863
As for De Winter he could scarcely believe that he had heard aright	77.54217075857878
The Comte de la Fere he cried in his turn	23.952086886769376
Oh sir reply I entreat youis not the Comte de la Fere a noble whom I remember handsome and brave a musketeer under Louis XIII	377.94378704589246
who must be now about fortyseven or fortyeight years of age	261.732195654315
Yes sir you are right in every particular	135.68698343545722
And who served under an assumed name	2196.482515129899
Latterly I heard his friend Monsieur dArtagnan give him that name	385.52802350953334
That is it madame that is the same	22.5508527928269
God be praised And he is in Paris continued he addressing Raoul then turning to the queen We may still hope	148.46670046175336
Providence has declared for us since I have found this brave man again in so miraculous a manner	68.42136933319958
And sir where does he reside pray	8032.131513210117
The Comte de la Fere lodges in the Rue Guenegaud Hotel du Grand Roi Charlemagne	449.04825790778546
Inform this dear friend that he may remain within that I shall go and see him immediately	43.92217657638859
Sir I obey with pleasure if her majesty will permit me to depart	101.24613933194843
Go Monsieur de Bragelonne said the queen and rest assured of our affection	226.55566239952256
Raoul bent respectfully before the two princesses and bowing to De Winter departed	834.5335664277367
The queen and De Winter continued to converse for some time in low voices in order that the young princess should not overhear them but the precaution was needless she was in deep converse with her own thoughts	147.10550872331638
Then when De Winter rose to take leave	42.98053220523628
Listen my lord said the queen I have preserved this diamond cross which came from my mother and this order of St	159.4307711915765
Michael which came from my husband	828.4897724964788
They are worth about fifty thousand pounds	61.38216448692105
I had sworn to die of hunger rather than part with these precious pledges but now that this ornament may be useful to him or his defenders everything must be sacrificed	278.88268902815145
Take them and if you need money for your expedition sell them fearlessly my lord	477.81916481604884
But should you find the means of retaining them remember my lord that I shall esteem you as having rendered the greatest service that a gentleman can render to a queen and in the day of my prosperity he who brings me this order and this cross shall be blessed by me and my children	134.25024877144605
Madame replied De Winter your majesty will be served by a man devoted to you	45.53740201770625
I hasten to deposit these two objects in a safe place nor should I accept them if the resources of our ancient fortune were left to us but our estates are confiscated our ready money is exhausted and we are reduced to turn to service everything we possess	224.0108604853453
In an hour hence I shall be with the Comte de la Fere and tomorrow your majesty shall have a definite reply	48.87390081074393
The queen tendered her hand to Lord de Winter who kissing it respectfully went out and traversed alone and unconducted those large dark and deserted apartments brushing away tears which blase as he was by fifty years spent as a courtier he could not withhold at the spectacle of royal distress so dignified yet so intense	396.06156714083244
The horse and servant belonging to De Winter were waiting for him at the door he proceeded toward his abode very thoughtfully looking behind him from time to him to contemplate the dark and silent frontage of the Louvre	203.3899222574762
It was then that he saw a horseman as it were detach himself from the wall and follow him at a little distance	71.06240566735597
In leaving the Palais Royal he remembered to have observed a similar shadow	169.5326585315684
Tony he said motioning to his groom to approach	140.3634815251683
Did you remark that man who is following us	75.84689846008582
I do not know only he has followed your grace from the Palais Royal stopped at the Louvre to wait for you and now leaves the Louvre with you	118.90807798065241
Some spy of the cardinal said De Winter to him aside	269.8410058071926
Let us pretend not to notice that he is watching us	101.25218330462127
And spurring on he plunged into the labyrinth of streets which led to his hotel situated near the Marais for having for so long a time lived near the Place Royale Lord de Winter naturally returned to lodge near his ancient dwelling	216.57004896644887
The unknown spurred his horse to a gallop	102.28334967367935
De Winter dismounted at his hotel and went up into his apartment intending to watch the spy but as he was about to place his gloves and hat on a table he saw reflected in a glass opposite to him a figure which stood on the threshold of the room	52.72946461402958
He turned around and Mordaunt stood before him	49.256882750896345
There was a moment of frozen silence between these two	472.0827658878204
Sir said De Winter I thought I had already made you aware that I am weary of this persecution withdraw then or I shall call and have you turned out as you were in London	124.81796533531997
I am not your uncle I know you not	17.970824282300477
My uncle replied Mordaunt with his harsh and bantering tone you are mistaken you will not have me turned out this time as you did in Londonyou dare not	130.08357465425547
As for denying that I am your nephew you will think twice about it now that I have learned some things of which I was ignorant a year ago	96.53267225654936
And how does it concern me what you have learned said De Winter	100.03467548681398
Oh it concerns you very closely my uncle I am sure and you will soon be of my opinion added he with a smile which sent a shudder through the veins of him he thus addressed	74.79677822759501
When I presented myself before you for the first time in London it was to ask you what had become of my fortune the second time it was to demand who had sullied my name and this time I come before you to ask a question far more terrible than any other to say to you as God said to the first murderer Cain what hast thou done to thy brother Abel My lord what have you done with your sisteryour sister who was my mother	78.85588567570532
De Winter shrank back from the fire of those scorching eyes	177.7996133354537
Yes my lord my mother replied the young man advancing into the room until he was face to face with Lord de Winter and crossing his arms	86.77053794163123
I have asked the headsman of Bethune he said his voice hoarse and his face livid with passion and grief	79.7033503672439
And the headsman of Bethune gave me a reply	138.400530986995
De Winter fell back in a chair as though struck by a thunderbolt and in vain attempted a reply	119.93405063564843
Yes continued the young man all is now explained with this key I open the abyss	280.3930003417113
My mother inherited an estate from her husband you have assassinated her my name would have secured me the paternal estate you have deprived me of it you have despoiled me of my fortune	89.17061508673955
I am no longer astonished that you knew me not	42.65072190025912
I am not surprised that you refused to recognize me	122.41838615093694
When a man is a robber it is hard to call him nephew whom he has impoverished when one is a murderer to recognize the man whom one has made an orphan	180.10101442341028
These words produced a contrary effect to that which Mordaunt had anticipated	214.71187079988627
De Winter remembered the monster that Milady had been he rose dignified and calm restraining by the severity of his look the wild glance of the young man	116.0519850854926
You desire to fathom this horrible secret said De Winter well then so be it	471.6720800538699
Know then what manner of woman it was for whom today you call me to account	133.9501348063283
That woman had in all probability poisoned my brother and in order to inherit from me she was about to assassinate me in my turn	99.57503852392684
I say that she was my mother	117.15013819615956
She caused the unfortunate Duke of Buckingham to be stabbed by a man who was ere that honest good and pure	151.58620507731695
What say you to that crime of which I have the proof	73.70416433843063
On our return to France she had a young woman who was attached to one of her opponents poisoned in the convent of the Augustines at Bethune	136.28431893700755
Will this crime persuade you of the justice of her punishmentfor of all this I have the proofs	119.81344862550755
She was my mother cried the young man who uttered these three successive exclamations with constantly increasing force	247.53365377073834
At last charged with murders with debauchery hated by every one and yet threatening still like a panther thirsting for blood she fell under the blows of men whom she had rendered desperate though they had never done her the least injury she met with judges whom her hideous crimes had evoked and that executioner you sawthat executioner who you say told you everythingthat executioner if he told you everything told you that he leaped with joy in avenging on her his brothers shame and suicide	466.9540870922102
Depraved as a girl adulterous as a wife an unnatural sister homicide poisoner execrated by all who knew her by every nation that had been visited by her she died accursed by Heaven and earth	340.82519658483073
A sob which Mordaunt could not repress burst from his throat and his livid face became suffused with blood he clenched his fists sweat covered his face his hair like Hamlets stood on end and racked with fury he cried out	137.53507473473974
Silence sir she was my mother Her crimes I know them not her disorders I know them not her vices I know them not	448.23454750262636
But this I know that I had a mother that five men leagued against one woman murdered her clandestinely by nightsilentlylike cowards	610.2419840754503
I know that you were one of them my uncle and that you cried louder than the others She must die	141.93168607842023
Therefore I warn you and listen well to my words that they may be engraved upon your memory never to be forgotten this murder which has robbed me of everythingthis murder which has deprived me of my namethis murder which has impoverished methis murder which has made me corrupt wicked implacableI shall summon you to account for it first and then those who were your accomplices when I discover them	243.54162026289092
With hatred in his eyes foaming at his mouth and his fist extended Mordaunt had advanced one more step a threatening terrible step toward De Winter	386.749044379926
The latter put his hand to his sword and said with the smile of a man who for thirty years has jested with death	35.73362663144689
Would you assassinate me sir Then I shall recognize you as my nephew for you would be a worthy son of such a mother	75.26293456057188
No replied Mordaunt forcing his features and the muscles of his body to resume their usual places and be calm no I shall not kill you at least not at this moment for without you I could not discover the others	115.00862770229222
But when I have found them then tremble sir	504.37333054397925
I stabbed to the heart the headsman of Bethune without mercy or pity and he was the least guilty of you all	231.4306887490553
With these words the young man went out and descended the stairs with sufficient calmness to pass unobserved then upon the lowest landing place he passed Tony leaning over the balustrade waiting only for a call from his master to mount to his room	243.1534361556159
But De Winter did not call crushed enfeebled he remained standing and with listening ear then only when he had heard the step of the horse going away he fell back on a chair saying	125.05107358270101
My God I thank Thee that he knows me only	107.49520289132677
Whilst this terrible scene was passing at Lord de Winters Athos seated near his window his elbow on the table and his head supported on his hand was listening intently to Raouls account of the adventures he met with on his journey and the details of the battle	111.08490780805236
Listening to the relation of those emotions so fresh and pure the fine noble face of Athos betrayed indescribable pleasure he inhaled the tones of that young voice as harmonious music	574.9665723603299
He forgot all that was dark in the past and that was cloudy in the future	104.12259970251328
It almost seemed as if the return of this much loved boy had changed his fears to hopes	309.09283408712975
Athos was happyhappy as he had never been before	44.719695768043856
And you assisted and took part in this great battle Bragelonne cried the former musketeer	1384.8891377924456
And it was a fierce one	110.79341606693148
His highness the prince charged eleven times in person	189.22592614039698
He is a great commander Bragelonne	348846.1670854402
I did not lose sight of him for an instant	9.309722322663532
Oh how fine it is to be called Cond and to be so worthy of such a name	86.62102108584997
He was calm and radiant was he not	37.368320643427424
As calm as at parade radiant as at a fete	1544.5488565690468
When we went up to the enemy it was slowly we were forbidden to draw first and we were marching toward the Spaniards who were on a height with lowered muskets	307.61219458648384
When we arrived about thirty paces from them the prince turned around to the soldiers Comrades he said you are about to suffer a furious discharge but after that you will make short work with those fellows	129.18587172378378
There was such dead silence that friends and enemies could have heard these words then raising his sword Sound trumpets he cried	242.16821184234118
Well very good you will do as much when the opportunity occurs will you Raoul	519.0128981476597
I know not sir but I thought it really very fine and grand	188.22392026826262
Were you afraid Raoul asked the count	2.688293543670438
Yes sir replied the young man naively I felt a great chill at my heart and at the word fire which resounded in Spanish from the enemys ranks I closed my eyes and thought of you	155.8091439323518
In honest truth Raoul said Athos pressing his hand	109.16861291785139
Yes sir at that instant there was such a rataplan of musketry that one might have imagined the infernal regions had opened	323.2906581097946
Those who were not killed felt the heat of the flames	113.28044343092049
I opened my eyes astonished to find myself alive and even unhurt a third of the squadron were lying on the ground wounded dead or dying	192.18241605852603
At that moment I encountered the eye of the prince	44.66135843447054
I had but one thought and that was that he was observing me	82.76783309014279
I spurred on and found myself in the enemys ranks	170.17671328814174
And the prince was pleased with you	24.429556908124567
He told me so at least sir when he desired me to return to Paris with Monsieur de Chatillon who was charged to carry the news to the queen and to bring the colors we had taken	79.82660637670052
Go said he the enemy will not rally for fifteen days and until that time I have no need of your service	84.03608127522389
Go and see those whom you love and who love you and tell my sister De Longueville that I thank her for the present that she made me of you	75.78896160240993
And I came sir added Raoul gazing at the count with a smile of real affection for I thought you would be glad to see me again	37.09328914403908
Athos drew the young man toward him and pressed his lips to his brow as he would have done to a young daughter	32.56598548638299
And now Raoul said he you are launched you have dukes for friends a marshal of France for godfather a prince of the blood as commander and on the day of your return you have been received by two queens it is not so bad for a novice	161.20400680222716
Oh sir said Raoul suddenly you recall something which in my haste to relate my exploits I had forgotten it is that there was with Her Majesty the Queen of England a gentleman who when I pronounced your name uttered a cry of surprise and joy he said he was a friend of yours asked your address and is coming to see you	104.08749823399843
I did not venture to ask sir he spoke elegantly although I thought from his accent he was an Englishman	277.77284967200256
Ah said Athos leaning down his head as if to remember who it could be	37.57131369811195
Then when he raised it again he was struck by the presence of a man who was standing at the open door and was gazing at him with a compassionate air	30.088735224029364
Lord de Winter exclaimed the count	4.168688908123599
And the two gentlemen were for an instant locked in each others arms then Athos looking into his friends face and taking him by both hands said	113.9425415731221
What ails you my lord you appear as unhappy as I am the reverse	115.3898345651127
Yes truly dear friend and I may even say the sight of you increases my dismay	301.52872326328435
And De Winter glancing around him Raoul quickly understood that the two friends wished to be alone and he therefore left the room unaffectedly	119.29742558952353
Come now that we are alone said Athos let us talk of yourself	38.25112352151407
Whilst we are alone let us speak of ourselves replied De Winter	82.56934215424894
Athos again struck by this name which seemed to pursue him like an echo hesitated for a moment then slightly knitting his brows he calmly said	170.16428411461158
I know it Grimaud met him between Bethune and Arras and then came here to warn me of his presence	147.91839568189675
No but he was present at the deathbed of a man who knew him	29.305039748645168
The headsman of Bethune exclaimed De Winter	987.3831444705592
You know about that cried Athos astonished	1926.4691252087011
He has just left me replied De Winter after telling me all	315.2053953433105
Ah my friend what a horrible scene Why did we not destroy the child with the mother	97.21506459555651
What need you fear said Athos recovering from the instinctive fear he had at first experienced by the aid of reason are we not men accustomed to defend ourselves Is this young man an assassin by professiona murderer in cold blood He has killed the executioner of Bethune in an access of passion but now his fury is assuaged	276.3722043729666
De Winter smiled sorrowfully and shook his head	21.731005600643236
Do you not know the race said he	148.45648779331626
Pooh said Athos trying to smile in his turn	29.838972546791172
It must have lost its ferocity in the second generation	330.5014094121081
Besides my friend Providence has warned us that we may be on our guard	89.23598673086777
All we can now do is to wait	155.61472313182736
Let us wait and as I said before let us speak of yourself	43.651866460383474
Affairs of importance which you shall know later	244.36904409089888
But what is this that I hear from Her Majesty the Queen of England Monsieur dArtagnan sides with Mazarin Pardon my frankness dear friend	671.6494619894911
I neither hate nor blame the cardinal and your opinions will be held ever sacred by me	321.12115406051925
But do you happen to belong to him	130.54404740359118
Monsieur dArtagnan replied Athos is in the service he is a soldier and obeys all constitutional authority	296.9867244448666
Monsieur dArtagnan is not rich and has need of his position as lieutenant to enable him to live	119.9012452056528
Millionaires like yourself my lord are rare in France	308.19988020778715
Alas said De Winter I am at this moment as poor as he is if not poorer	83.14868043401168
But to return to our subject	6614.042638804753
Well then you wish to know if I am of Mazarins party No	180.15611841167035
Pardon my frankness too my lord	111.12431064068731
I am obliged to you count for this pleasing intelligence You make me young and happy again by it	252.25602750667755
Ah so you are not a Mazarinist Delightful Indeed you could not belong to him	292.3087176777851
But pardon me are you free I mean to ask if you are married	57.28388677539535
Ah as to that no replied Athos laughing	1276.2208578337334
Because that young man so handsome so elegant so polished	282.63993276888505
Is a child I have adopted and who does not even know who was his father	74.06539922578207
Very well you are always the same Athos great and generous	682.6996272093309
Are you still friends with Monsieur Porthos and Monsieur Aramis	1757.326737378544
We still remain four friends devoted to each other but when it becomes a question of serving the cardinal or of fighting him of being Mazarinists or Frondists then we are only two	172.367627525235
Is Monsieur Aramis with DArtagnan asked Lord de Winter	288.43469667714976
No said Athos Monsieur Aramis does me the honor to share my opinions	120.04926929599446
Could you put me in communication with your witty and agreeable friend Is he much changed	423.0254608848077
He has become an abb that is all	24.48348678036985
You alarm me his profession must have made him renounce any great undertakings	502.34379860904863
On the contrary said Athos smiling he has never been so much a musketeer as since he became an abb and you will find him a veritable soldier	105.23003085147135
Could you engage to bring him to me tomorrow morning at ten oclock on the Pont du Louvre	35.86359425421826
Oh oh exclaimed Athos smiling you have a duel in prospect	108.45016092101642
Yes count and a splendid duel too a duel in which I hope you will take your part	68.92898137651441
Where are we to go my lord	288.86724595778685
To Her Majesty the Queen of England who has desired me to present you to her	36.95587369814283
This is an enigma said Athos but it matters not since you know the solution of it I ask no further	118.31363761957381
Will your lordship do me the honor to sup with me	20.51789383389706
Thanks count no replied De Winter	257.56728201229294
I own to you that that young mans visit has subdued my appetite and probably will rob me of my sleep	275.6393063283992
What undertaking can have brought him to Paris It was not to meet me that he came for he was ignorant of my journey	56.12780100895804
This young man terrifies me my lord there lies in him a sanguinary predisposition	1974.5691854923448
He is one of Cromwells most enthusiastic disciples	5351.711522750152
But what attached him to the cause His father and mother were Catholics I believe	657.1392796643554
His hatred of the king who deprived him of his estates and forbade him to bear the name of De Winter	131.2096346839552
And what name does he now bear	1377.292637462363
A Puritan yet disguised as a monk he travels alone in France	321.40600796744906
Do you say as a monk	10098.299651714775
It was thus and by mere accidentmay God pardon me if I blasphemethat he heard the confession of the executioner of Bethune	361.2833036845614
Then I understand it all he has been sent by Cromwell to Mazarin and the queen guessed rightly we have been forestalled	200.97294043316003
Everything is clear to me now	247.94594866222474
But the night is dark said Athos perceiving that Lord de Winter seemed more uneasy than he wished to appear and you have no servant	132.03266419497433
I have Tony a safe if simple youth	5306.449656731111
Halloo there Grimaud Olivain and Blaisois call the viscount and take the musket with you	241.796531797957
Blaisois was the tall youth half groom half peasant whom we saw at the Chateau de Bragelonne whom Athos had christened by the name of his province	271.05183418103644
Viscount said Athos to Raoul as he entered you will conduct my lord as far as his hotel and permit no one to approach him	98.27418123604421
Oh count said De Winter for whom do you take me	38.13236331559302
For a stranger who does not know Paris said Athos and to whom the viscount will show the way	102.7541768423456
De Winter shook him by the hand	13.727205128980833
Grimaud said Athos put yourself at the head of the troop and beware of the monk	84.62596017637294
Grimaud shuddered and nodding awaited the departure regarding the butt of his musket with silent eloquence	435.24237953370647
Then obeying the orders given him by Athos he headed the small procession bearing the torch in one hand and the musket in the other until it reached De Winters inn when pounding on the portal with his fist he bowed to my lord and faced about without a word	287.9760115651544
The same order was followed in returning nor did Grimauds searching glance discover anything of a suspicious appearance save a dark shadow as it were in ambuscade at the corner of the Rue Guenegaud and of the Quai	285.35491796062774
He fancied also that in going he had already observed the street watcher who had attracted his attention	204.90073427184717
He pushed on toward him but before he could reach it the shadow had disappeared into an alley into which Grimaud deemed it scarcely prudent to pursue it	153.78235459773467
The next day on awaking the count perceived Raoul by his bedside	185.56773354394025
The young man was already dressed and was reading a new book by M	123.18544148000441
Already up Raoul exclaimed the count	3.460245995586622
Yes sir replied Raoul with slight hesitation I did not sleep well	81.63928674390053
You Raoul not sleep well then you must have something on your mind said Athos	62.080559832396006
Sir you will perhaps think that I am in a great hurry to leave you when I have only just arrived but	39.21175881384617
Have you only two days of leave Raoul	1694.0276597276677
On the contrary sir I have ten nor is it to the camp I wish to go	96.00204465679163
Where then said Athos smiling if it be not a secret	53.012826173374336
You are now almost a man since you have made your first passage of arms and have acquired the right to go where you will without consulting me	113.53746290153168
Never sir said Raoul as long as I possess the happiness of having you for a protector shall I deem I have the right of freeing myself from a guardianship so valuable to me	113.30829341395545
I have however a wish to go and pass a day at Blois	74.31765132313505
You look at me and you are going to laugh at me	32.37788493878904
No on the contrary I am not inclined to laugh said Athos suppressing a sigh	209.00212661590567
You wish to see Blois again it is but natural	77.92299846398255
Then you permit me to go you are not angry in your heart exclaimed Raoul joyously	202.37741073828292
Certainly and why should I regret what gives you pleasure	412.49899618374855
Oh how kind you are exclaimed the young man pressing his guardians hand and I can set out immediately	61.8711263433987
Sir said Raoul as he turned to leave the room I have thought of one thing and that is about the Duchess of Chevreuse who was so kind to me and to whom I owe my introduction to the prince	55.474375158834604
And you ought to thank her Raoul	1961.119834399877
Well try the Hotel de Luynes Raoul and ask if the duchess can receive you	328.1047869417227
I am glad to see you pay attention to the usages of the world	53.15465477280351
You must take Grimaud and Olivain	56588.096028883156
Raoul went out and when Athos heard his young joyous voice calling to Grimaud and Olivain he sighed	534.6659219325617
It is very soon to leave me he thought but he follows the common custom	196.25183200066957
Nature has made us thus she makes the young look ever forward not behind	836.6271197280233
He certainly likes the child but will he love me less as his affection grows for her	341.57126996033253
And Athos confessed to himself that he was unprepared for so prompt a departure but Raoul was so happy that this reflection effaced everything else from the consideration of his guardian	214.64597204670798
Everything was ready at ten oclock for the departure and as Athos was watching Raoul mount a groom rode up from the Duchess de Chevreuse	190.59510467640223
He was charged to tell the Comte de la Fere that she had learned of the return of her youthful protege and also the manner he had conducted himself on the field and she added that she should be very glad to offer him her congratulations	67.22344438955237
Tell her grace replied Athos that the viscount has just mounted his horse to proceed to the Hotel de Luynes	112.97000035371113
Then with renewed instructions to Grimaud Athos signified to Raoul that he could set out and ended by reflecting that it was perhaps better that Raoul should be away from Paris at that moment	231.39091476333712
Another Queen in Want of Help	16143.7019155274
Athos had not failed to send early to Aramis and had given his letter to Blaisois the only servingman whom he had left	266.62019414790365
Blaisois found Bazin donning his beadles gown his services being required that day at Notre Dame	913.14601736459
Athos had desired Blaisois to try to speak to Aramis himself	126.29513974976773
Blaisois a tall simple youth who understood nothing but what he was expressly told asked therefore for the Abb dHerblay and in spite of Bazins assurances that his master was not at home he persisted in such a manner as to put Bazin into a passion	161.98263187633376
Blaisois seeing Bazin in clerical guise was a little discomposed at his denials and wanted to pass at all risks believing too that the man with whom he had to do was endowed with the virtues of his cloth namely patience and Christian charity	250.88501019622552
But Bazin still the servant of a musketeer when once the blood mounted to his fat cheeks seized a broomstick and began belaboring Blaisois saying	309.67711361935545
You have insulted the church my friend you have insulted the church	145.5461232464017
At this moment Aramis aroused by this unusual disturbance cautiously opened the door of his room and Blaisois looking reproachfully at the Cerberus drew the letter from his pocket and presented it to Aramis	92.60428673190499
From the Comte de la Fere said Aramis	161.81800420424227
And he retired into his room without even asking the cause of so much noise	78.79828519270434
Blaisois returned disconsolate to the Hotel of the Grand Roi Charlemagne and when Athos inquired if his commission was executed he related his adventure	523.616208655346
You foolish fellow said Athos laughing	116.08249140430611
And you did not tell him that you came from me	24.028122813001122
At ten oclock Athos with his habitual exactitude was waiting on the Pont du Louvre and was almost immediately joined by Lord de Winter	97.32045298423941
They waited ten minutes and then his lordship began to fear Aramis was not coming to join them	165.79533593539753
Patience said Athos whose eyes were fixed in the direction of the Rue du Bac patience I see an abb cuffing a man then bowing to a woman it must be Aramis	102.6815702078656
Having run against a young shopkeeper who was gaping at the crows and who had splashed him Aramis with one blow of his fist had distanced him ten paces	359.65631960514764
At this moment one of his penitents passed and as she was young and pretty Aramis took off his cap to her with his most gracious smile	167.9602361862098
A most affectionate greeting as one can well believe took place between him and Lord de Winter	234.85422056232056
Where are we going inquired Aramis are we going to fight perchance I carry no sword this morning and can not return home to procure one	126.80583712365524
No said Lord de Winter we are going to pay a visit to Her Majesty the Queen of England	58.37685720797167
Oh very well replied Aramis then bending his face down to Athoss ear what is the object of this visit continued he	160.05636298518954
Nay I know not some evidence required from us perhaps	641.9323213266147
May it not be about that cursed affair asked Aramis in which case I do not greatly care to go for it will be to pocket a lecture and since it is my function to give them to others I am rather averse to receiving them myself	200.53158167443792
If it were so answered Athos we should not be taken there by Lord de Winter for he would come in for his share he was one of us	96.47826436002701
You re right yes let us go	3.5619893716658253
On arriving at the Louvre Lord de Winter entered first indeed there was but one porter there to receive them at the gate	250.07670126735553
It was impossible in daylight for the impoverished state of the habitation grudging charity had conceded to an unfortunate queen to pass unnoticed by Athos Aramis and even the Englishman	469.49182956169454
Large rooms completely stripped of furniture bare walls upon which here and there shone the old gold moldings which had resisted time and neglect windows with broken panes impossible to close no carpets neither guards nor servants this is what first met the eyes of Athos to which he touching his companions elbow directed his attention by his glances	527.7066408098793
Mazarin is better lodged said Aramis	1997.2040713451308
Mazarin is almost king answered Athos Madame Henrietta is almost no longer queen	477.0783605398857
If you would condescend to be clever Athos observed Aramis I really do think you would be wittier than poor Monsieur de Voiture	470.8199434667897
The queen appeared to be impatiently expecting them for at the first slight noise she heard in the hall leading to her room she came herself to the door to receive these courtiers in the corridors of Misfortune	104.29698860829299
You are welcome gentlemen she said	2.477643244293754
The gentlemen entered and remained standing but at a motion from the queen they seated themselves	170.85822612053096
Athos was calm and grave but Aramis was furious the sight of such royal misery exasperated him and his eyes examined every new trace of poverty that presented itself	454.1096173819368
You are examining the luxury I enjoy said the queen glancing sadly around her	350.7044479887996
Madame replied Aramis I must ask your pardon but I know not how to hide my indignation at seeing how a daughter of Henry IV	125.20354861804087
is treated at the court of France	12.533130348594273
Monsieur Aramis is not an officer asked the queen of Lord de Winter	121.26554616858034
That gentleman is the Abb dHerblay replied he	339.244832207719
Madame he said I am an abb it is true but I am so against my will	60.3127813128161
I never had a vocation for the bands my cassock is fastened by one button only and I am always ready to become a musketeer once more	198.32002203642273
This morning being ignorant that I should have the honor of seeing your majesty I encumbered myself with this dress but you will find me none the less a man devoted to your majestys service in whatever way you may see fit to use me	90.60038625789889
The Abb dHerblay resumed De Winter is one of those gallant musketeers formerly belonging to His Majesty King Louis XIII	512.238339380199
of whom I have spoken to you madame	16.6394145893417
Then turning to Athos he continued And this gentleman is that noble Comte de la Fere whose high reputation is so well known to your majesty	114.99174721484097
Gentlemen said the queen a few years ago I had around me ushers treasures armies and by the lifting of a finger all these were busied in my service	292.13036074067867
Today look around you and it may astonish you that in order to accomplish a plan which is dearer to me than life I have only Lord de Winter the friend of twenty years and you gentlemen whom I see for the first time and whom I know but as my countrymen	89.7103179844748
It is enough said Athos bowing low if the lives of three men can purchase yours madame	529.1831170335511
I am not only the most miserable of queens but the most unhappy of mothers the most wretched of wives	319.9799028267166
My children two of them at least the Duke of York and the Princess Elizabeth are far away from me exposed to the blows of the ambitious and our foes my husband the king is leading in England so wretched an existence that it is no exaggeration to aver that he seeks death as a thing to be desired	228.6643986002801
Hold gentlemen here is the letter conveyed to me by Lord de Winter	130.40617294805824
Obeying the queen Athos read aloud the letter which we have already seen in which King Charles demanded to know whether the hospitality of France would be accorded him	84.06336598494072
Well asked Athos when he had closed the letter	54.653159181062165
Well said the queen it has been refused	68.86550246812294
The two friends exchanged a smile of contempt	73.03178132653893
And now said Athos what is to be done I have the honor to inquire from your majesty what you desire Monsieur dHerblay and myself to do in your service	69.23901482251019
Ah sir you have a noble heart exclaimed the queen with a burst of gratitude whilst Lord de Winter turned to her with a glance which said Did I not answer for them	86.19235659554444
But you sir said the queen to Aramis	704.3686285333781
I madame replied he follow Monsieur de la Fere wherever he leads even were it on to death without demanding wherefore but when it concerns your majestys service then added he looking at the queen with all the grace of former days I precede the count	242.58151917539413
Well then gentlemen said the queen since it is thus and since you are willing to devote yourselves to the service of a poor princess whom the whole world has abandoned this is what is required to be done for me	79.6242744282081
The king is alone with a few gentlemen whom he fears to lose every day surrounded by the Scotch whom he distrusts although he be himself a Scotchman	299.60973712590084
Since Lord de Winter left him I am distracted sirs	849.5303328257165
I ask much too much perhaps for I have no title to request it	68.50833933984657
Go to England join the king be his friends protectors march to battle at his side and be near him in his house where conspiracies more dangerous than the perils of war are hatching every day	331.5713943672184
And in exchange for the sacrifice that you make gentlemen I promisenot to reward you I believe that word would offend youbut to love you as a sister to prefer you next to my husband and my children to every one	325.0242174164519
And the queen raised her eyes solemnly upward	5091.502381074504
Madame said Athos when must we set out	104.38755560754758
You consent then exclaimed the queen joyfully	6288.3425435464
Yes madame only it seems to me that your majesty goes too far in engaging to load us with a friendship so far above our merit	192.6202460383425
We render service to God madame in serving a prince so unfortunate a queen so virtuous	519.8490149149708
Madame we are yours body and soul	84.36342326415806
Oh sirs said the queen moved even to tears this is the first time for five years I have felt the least approach to joy or hope	92.22977361950348
God who can read my heart all the gratitude I feel will reward you Save my husband Save the king and although you care not for the price that is placed upon a good action in this world leave me the hope that we shall meet again when I may be able to thank you myself	98.7363819813539
In the meantime I remain here	39.6669894744831
Have you anything to ask of me From this moment I become your friend and since you are engaged in my affairs I ought to occupy myself in yours	82.32449597809799
Madame replied Athos I have only to ask your majestys prayers	174.5104876580689
And I said Aramis I am alone in the world and have only your majesty to serve	49.75921869788794
The queen held out her hand which they kissed and she said in a low tone to De Winter	53.66404275475974
If you need money my lord separate the jewels I have given you detach the diamonds and sell them to some Jew	288.88569393201226
You will receive for them fifty or sixty thousand francs spend them if necessary but let these gentlemen be treated as they deserve that is to say like kings	240.76801056584327
The queen had two letters ready one written by herself the other by her daughter the Princess Henrietta	400.7419393694542
Both were addressed to King Charles	43.15773171328916
She gave the first to Athos and the other to Aramis so that should they be separated by chance they might make themselves known to the king after which they withdrew	181.88750190963233
At the foot of the staircase De Winter stopped	1066.600350211894
Not to arouse suspicions gentlemen said he go your way and I will go mine and this evening at nine oclock we will assemble again at the Gate Saint Denis	93.87549777171729
We will travel on horseback as far as our horses can go and afterward we can take the post	89.42835061907154
Once more let me thank you my good friends both in my own name and the queens	56.91736254486867
The three gentlemen then shook hands Lord de Winter taking the Rue Saint Honore and Athos and Aramis remaining together	279.5449832978798
Well said Aramis when they were alone what do you think of this business my dear count	27.46968192399436
But you received it with enthusiasm	29754.49445356985
As I shall ever receive the defense of a great principle my dear DHerblay	278.1440628632596
Monarchs are only strong by the assistance of the aristocracy but aristocracy can not survive without the countenance of monarchs	214.07123046959745
Let us then support monarchy in order to support ourselves	111.61363666545645
We shall be murdered there said Aramis	212.09629755167964
I hate the Englishthey are coarse like every nation that swills beer	6514.564476313711
Would it be better to remain here said Athos and take a turn in the Bastile or the dungeon of Vincennes for having favored the escape of Monsieur de Beaufort Ifaith Aramis believe me there is little left to regret	244.1036294488136
We avoid imprisonment and we play the part of heroes the choice is easy	458.24882342792546
It is true but in everything friend one must always return to the same questiona stupid one I admit but very necessaryhave you any money	453.6972208383082
Something like a hundred pistoles that my farmer sent to me the day before I left Bragelonne but out of that sum I ought to leave fifty for Raoula young man must live respectably	230.69277505674958
I have then about fifty pistoles	7562.548505245979
As for me I am quite sure that after turning out all my pockets and emptying my drawers I shall not find ten louis at home	157.9285459674237
Fortunately Lord de Winter is rich	436.80061541354917
Lord de Winter is ruined for the moment Oliver Cromwell has annexed his income resources	647.1884131990746
Now is the time when Baron Porthos would be useful	673.972151139828
Now it is that I regret DArtagnan	32185.15305683399
This secret Aramis does not belong to us take my advice then and let no one into our confidence	114.2534521869714
And moreover in taking such a step we should appear to be doubtful of ourselves	162.11320500948224
Let us regret their absence to ourselves for our own sakes but not speak of it	133.4871534576622
You are right but what are you going to do until this evening I have two things to postpone	37.75058202498569
First a thrust with the coadjutor whom I met last night at Madame de Rambouillets and whom I found particular in his remarks respecting me	230.92124434221003
Oh fiea quarrel between priests a duel between allies	961.4960506525873
What can I do friend he is a bully and so am I his cassock is a burden to him and I imagine I have had enough of mine in fact there is so much resemblance between us that I sometimes believe he is Aramis and I am the coadjutor	132.9400227441974
This kind of life fatigues and oppresses me besides he is a turbulent fellow who will ruin our party	191.62079352295441
I am convinced that if I gave him a box on the ear such as I gave this morning to the little citizen who splashed me it would change the appearance of things	148.81330843501473
And I my dear Aramis quietly replied Athos I think it would only change Monsieur de Retzs appearance	503.26248157212575
Take my advice leave things just as they are besides you are neither of you now your own masters he belongs to the Fronde and you to the queen of England	113.12065095015524
So if the second matter which you regret being unable to attend to is not more important than the first	88.05227139333502
Oh that is of the first importance	255.54801080506172
Attend to it then at once	10.862472812721869
Unfortunately it is a thing that I ca nt perform at any time I choose	46.12705264633326
It was arranged for the evening and no other time will serve	225.10423892090054
I understand said Athos smiling midnight	61196.88323138507
But my dear fellow those are things that bear postponement and you must put it off especially with so good an excuse to give on your return	169.34496552653047
If you do not return how does it concern you Be reasonable	1048.4281283564098
Come you are no longer twenty years old	84.21996296513043
To my great regret mordieu Ah if I were but twenty years old	77.39678060980913
Yes said Athos doubtless you would commit great follies But now we must part	830.9033344841156
I have one or two visits to make and a letter yet to write	176.62506655607535
Call for me at eight oclock or shall I wait supper for you at seven	83.31382186534455
That will do very well said Aramis	229.0446962872131
I have twenty visits to make and as many letters to write	267.9754705201982
Athos went to pay a visit to Madame de Vendome left his name at Madame de Chevreuses and wrote the following letter to DArtagnan	151.72364522041715
Dear FriendI am about to set off with Aramis on important business	907.1997701557
I wished to make my adieux to you but time does not permit	278.42803757514736
Remember that I write to you now to repeat how much affection for you I still cherish	204.04804094776816
Raoul is gone to Blois and is ignorant of my departure watch over him in my absence as much as you possibly can and if by chance you receive no news of me three months hence tell him to open a packet which he will find addressed to him in my bronze casket at Blois of which I send you now the key	128.13282085154336
Embrace Porthos from Aramis and myself	334.8844520183561
At the hour agreed upon Aramis arrived he was dressed as an officer and had the old sword at his side which he had drawn so often and which he was more than ever ready to draw	103.44326174933964
Bythebye he said I think that we are decidedly wrong to depart thus without leaving a line for Porthos and DArtagnan	285.8909131483901
The thing is done dear friend said Athos I foresaw that and have embraced them both from you and myself	166.75408898321024
You are a wonderful man my dear count said Aramis you think of everything	29.748709743699198
Well have you made up your mind to this journey	42.442009683741674
Quite and now that I reflect about it I am glad to leave Paris at this moment	38.70190507835382
And so am I replied Athos my only regret is not having seen DArtagnan but the rascal is so cunning he might have guessed our project	238.39705173001403
When supper was over Blaisois entered	225.1129181375191
Sir said he here is Monsieur dArtagnans answer	14267.14807804407
But I did not tell you there would be an answer stupid said Athos	138.6924323990737
And I set off without waiting for one but he called me back and gave me this and he presented a little leather bag plump and giving out a golden jingle	225.57847343094323
Athos opened it and began by drawing forth a little note written in these terms	273.67913548139734
My dear CountWhen one travels and especially for three months one never has a superfluity of money	173.48792869754288
Now recalling former times of mutual distress I send you half my purse it is money to obtain which I made Mazarin sweat	505.08435004099766
Do nt make a bad use of it I entreat you	31.500565295977385
As to what you say about not seeing you again I believe not a word of it with such a heart as yoursand such a swordone passes through the valley of the shadow of death a dozen times unscathed and unalarmed	164.20348623608
It is unnecessary to say that from the day I saw Raoul I loved him nevertheless believe that I heartily pray that I may not become to him a father however much I might be proud of such a son	114.46049241310612
Be it well understood that the fifty louis which I send are equally for Aramis as for youfor you as Aramis	705.2517688307007
Athos smiled and his fine eye was dimmed by a tear	124.96445719300374
DArtagnan who had loved him so tenderly loved him still although a Mazarinist	555.265239209211
There are the fifty louis ifaith said Aramis emptying the purse on the table all bearing the effigy of Louis XIII	221.61920510793544
Well what shall you do with this money count Shall you keep it or send it back	105.42891112363104
I shall keep it Aramis and even though I had no need of it I still should keep it	77.43258589765007
What is offered from a generous heart should be accepted generously	1135.1113327546987
Take twentyfive of them Aramis and give me the remaining twentyfive	92.85675651106166
All right I am glad to see you are of my opinion	21.137566930042997
When you like but have you no groom	322.37222220563893
No that idiot Bazin had the folly to make himself verger as you know and therefore can not leave Notre Dame	136.15221759658894
Very well take Blaisois with whom I know not what to do since I already have Grimaud	138.3274002061768
At this moment Grimaud appeared at the door	5.297308685554688
Ready said he with his usual curtness	2548.596153135473
Let us go then said Athos	14823.267616818795
The two friends mounted as did their servants	384.74463026003997
At the corner of the Quai they encountered Bazin who was running breathlessly	1452.548590470542
Oh sir exclaimed he thank Heaven I have arrived in time	126.41483162593397
Monsieur Porthos has just been to your house and has left this for you saying that the letter was important and must be given to you before you left	77.8693416327986
Good said Aramis taking a purse which Bazin presented to him	134.86762419055987
Wait your reverence there is a letter	42.20847643187041
You know I have already told you that if you ever call me anything but chevalier I will break every bone in your body	112.85527070990223
How can you read asked Athos it is as dark as a cold oven	197.09848268437673
Wait said Bazin striking a flint and setting afire a twisted waxlight with which he started the church candles	1079.7911407085053
Thus illumined Aramis read the following epistle	1709.9898534695635
My dear DHerblayI learned from DArtagnan who has embraced me on the part of the Comte de la Fere and yourself that you are setting out on a journey which may perhaps last two or three months as I know that you do not like to ask money of your friends I offer you some of my own accord	49.999172452207056
Here are two hundred pistoles which you can dispose of as you wish and return to me when opportunity occurs	203.64530783394792
Do not fear that you put me to inconvenience if I want money I can send for some to any of my chateaux at Bracieux alone I have twenty thousand francs in gold	124.19764099909209
So if I do not send you more it is because I fear you would not accept a larger sum	94.33441542317198
I address you because you know that although I esteem him from my heart I am a little awed by the Comte de la Fere but it is understood that what I offer you I offer him at the same time	53.51510279050143
I am as I trust you do not doubt your devoted	55.81773314440221
Du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierrefonds	101.32487199269393
Well said Aramis what do you say to that	17.742987087891606
I say my dear DHerblay that it is almost sacrilege to distrust Providence when one has such friends and therefore we will divide the pistoles from Porthos as we divided the louis sent by DArtagnan	373.98326486881064
The division being made by the light of Bazins taper the two friends continued their road and a quarter of an hour later they had joined De Winter at the Porte Saint Denis	120.72017124854038
In which it is proved that first Impulses are oftentimes the best	647.2633773265121
The three gentlemen took the road to Picardy a road so well known to them and which recalled to Athos and Aramis some of the most picturesque adventures of their youth	128.14873418779447
If Mousqueton were with us observed Athos on reaching the spot where they had had a dispute with the paviers how he would tremble at passing this Do you remember Aramis that it was here he received that famous bullet wound	287.53334757063243
By my faith twould be excusable in him to tremble replied Aramis for even I feel a shudder at the recollection hold just above that tree is the little spot where I thought I was killed	195.3122942963854
It was soon time for Grimaud to recall the past	267.77707233734367
Arriving before the inn at which his master and himself had made such an enormous repast he approached Athos and said showing him the airhole of the cellar	229.10656777534996
Athos began to laugh for this juvenile escapade of his appeared to be as amusing as if some one had related it of another person	292.57744650434245
At last after traveling two days and a night they arrived at Boulogne toward the evening favored by magnificent weather	287.42467596245757
Boulogne was a strong position then almost a deserted town built entirely on the heights what is now called the lower town did not then exist	395.4176458118213
Gentlemen said De Winter on reaching the gate of the town let us do here as at Parislet us separate to avoid suspicion	284.75306749307487
I know an inn little frequented but of which the host is entirely devoted to me	141.85870846248076
I will go there where I expect to find letters and you go to the first tavern in the town to LEpee du Grand Henri for instance refresh yourselves and in two hours be upon the jetty our boat is waiting for us there	199.71960377477384
The matter being thus decided the two friends found about two hundred paces further the tavern indicated	140.91425410876678
Their horses were fed but not unsaddled the grooms supped for it was already late and their two masters impatient to return appointed a place of meeting with them on the jetty and desired them on no account to exchange a word with any one	250.5867314078852
It is needless to say that this caution concerned Blaisois alonelong enough since it had been a useless one to Grimaud	558.3801284170528
Athos and Aramis walked down toward the port	337.7163755807915
From their dress covered with dust and from a certain easy manner by means of which a man accustomed to travel is always recognizable the two friends excited the attention of a few promenaders	172.2102271115438
There was more especially one upon whom their arrival had produced a decided impression	391.41713093469485
This man whom they had noticed from the first for the same reason they had themselves been remarked by others was walking in a listless way up and down the jetty	126.78253123366052
From the moment he perceived them he did not cease to look at them and seemed to burn with the wish to speak to them	64.66088768442748
On reaching the jetty Athos and Aramis stopped to look at a little boat made fast to a pile and ready rigged as if waiting to start	174.23630214323182
That is doubtless our boat said Athos	91.1041884320274
Yes replied Aramis and the sloop out there making ready to sail must be that which is to take us to our destination now continued he if only De Winter does not keep us waiting	264.5208371456085
It is not at all amusing here there is not a single woman passing	175.0561860092926
Hush said Athos we are overheard	16212.606341260138
In truth the walker who during the observations of the two friends had passed and repassed behind them several times stopped at the name of De Winter but as his face betrayed no emotion at mention of this name it might have been by chance he stood so still	169.84263737267727
Gentlemen said the man who was young and pale bowing with ease and courtesy pardon my curiosity but I see you come from Paris or at least that you are strangers at Boulogne	132.5450084706846
We come from Paris yes replied Athos with the same courtesy what is there we can do for you	63.460285150153204
Sir said the young man will you be so good as to tell me if it be true that Cardinal Mazarin is no longer minister	73.08228511705632
That is a strange question said Aramis	98.84792034950084
He is and he is not replied Athos that is to say he is dismissed by onehalf of France but by intrigues and promises he makes the other half sustain him you will perceive that this may last a long time	208.1793614637417
However sir said the stranger he has neither fled nor is in prison	334.18855869739286
No sir not at this moment at least	11.378810302721188
Sirs accept my thanks for your politeness said the young man retreating	71.95483738949366
What do you think of that interrogator asked Aramis	1328.8354094112865
I think he is either a dull provincial person or a spy in search of information	272.34770478891954
And you replied to him with that notion	468.95988196415254
Nothing warranted me to answer him otherwise he was polite to me and I was so to him	100.84646099406731
But if he be a spy	9285.359850297213
What do you think a spy would be about here We are not living in the time of Cardinal Richelieu who would have closed the ports on bare suspicion	185.51032653528912
It matters not you were wrong to reply to him as you did continued Aramis following with his eyes the young man now vanishing behind the cliffs	165.6801200413424
And you said Athos you forget that you committed a very different kind of imprudence in pronouncing Lord de Winters name	313.82727103101155
Did you not see that at that name the young man stopped	86.33512485539818
More reason then when he spoke to you for sending him about his business	124.6920745579823
And since when have you become afraid of a quarrel	143.8976780676189
I am always afraid of a quarrel when I am expected at any place and when such a quarrel might possibly prevent my reaching it	180.292059243711
Besides let me own something to you	32.25816965170253
I am anxious to see that young man nearer	168.19484741572313
Aramis you will certainly laugh at me you will say that I am always repeating the same thing you will call me the most timorous of visionaries but to whom do you see a resemblance in that young man	82.24461227703159
In beauty or on the contrary asked Aramis laughing	489.620079138123
In ugliness in so far as a man can resemble a woman	83.15299372327398
Ah Egad cried Aramis you set me thinking	335.72595814297864
No in truth you are no visionary my dear friend and now I think of ityouyes ifaith you re rightthose delicate yet firmset lips those eyes which seem always at the command of the intellect and never of the heart Yes it is one of Miladys bastards	350.9326262384169
I swear to you I like no better than yourself to meet that viper in my path	218.11367715987723
Ah here is De Winter coming said Athos	643.2731397356216
Good one thing now is only awanting and that is that our grooms should not keep us waiting	155.75666468976317
I see them about twenty paces behind my lord	94.98994263364156
I recognize Grimaud by his long legs and his determined slouch	839.0279127663068
Then we set sail tonight asked Aramis glancing toward the west where the sun had left a single golden cloud which dipping into the ocean appeared by degrees to be extinguished	145.02612874100055
Diable resumed Aramis I have little fancy for the sea by day still less at night the sounds of wind and wave the frightful movements of the vessel I confess I prefer the convent of Noisy	217.17328773621065
Athos smiled sadly for it was evident that he was thinking of other things as he listened to his friend and moved toward De Winter	91.92436465396999
What ails our friend said Aramis he resembles one of Dantes damned whose neck Apollyon has dislocated and who are ever looking at their heels	760.9499557487721
What the devil makes him glower thus behind him	1576.5136337068107
When De Winter perceived them in his turn he advanced toward them with surprising rapidity	99.79545127713588
What is the matter my lord said Athos and what puts you out of breath thus	149.5092005839322
Nothing replied De Winter nothing and yet in passing the heights it seemed to me and he again turned round	119.24658248545464
But let us go continued De Winter let us be off the boat must be waiting for us and there is our sloop at anchordo you see it there I wish I were on board already and he looked back again	137.44480217270012
He has seen him said Athos in a low tone to Aramis	43.05328248150845
They had reached the ladder which led to the boat	21.068646457241734
De Winter made the grooms who carried the arms and the porters with the luggage descend first and was about to follow them	146.04979348471514
At this moment Athos perceived a man walking on the seashore parallel to the jetty and hastening his steps as if to reach the other side of the port scarcely twenty steps from the place of embarking	101.90425025849639
He fancied in the darkness that he recognized the young man who had questioned him	36.606556652646184
Athos now descended the ladder in his turn without losing sight of the young man	28.536884808829576
The latter to make a short cut had appeared on a sluice	490.586342472126
He certainly bodes us no good said Athos but let us embark once out at sea let him come	248.21974480124052
And Athos sprang into the boat which was immediately pushed off and which soon sped seawards under the efforts of four stalwart rowers	713.2000770223208
But the young man had begun to follow or rather to advance before the boat	106.98770905477892
She was obliged to pass between the point of the jetty surmounted by a beacon just lighted and a rock which jutted out	257.7071162949727
They saw him in the distance climbing the rock in order to look down upon the boat as it passed	122.74685034013122
Ay but said Aramis that young fellow is decidedly a spy	626.8439027923362
Which is the young man asked De Winter turning around	354.5766928738126
He who followed us and spoke to us awaits us there behold	599.0393642730605
De Winter turned and followed the direction of Aramiss finger	495.710283205454
The beacon bathed with light the little strait through which they were about to pass and the rock where the young man stood with bare head and crossed arms	105.2047799533038
It is he exclaimed De Winter seizing the arm of Athos it is he I thought I recognized him and I was not mistaken	68.47441496744617
Whom do you mean asked Aramis	3636.7124262795087
The young man heard these words and bent so forward over the rock that one might have supposed he was about to precipitate himself from it	100.02342319055641
Yes it is I my uncleI the son of MiladyI the monkI the secretary and friend of CromwellI know you now both you and your companions	490.75713050228825
In that boat sat three men unquestionably brave whose courage no man would have dared dispute nevertheless at that voice that accent and those gestures they felt a chill access of terror cramp their veins	719.3868106405987
As for Grimaud his hair stood on end and drops of sweat ran down his brow	65.23983808678163
Ah exclaimed Aramis that is the nephew the monk and the son of Milady as he says himself	169.5663334585927
Then wait said Aramis and with the terrible coolness which on important occasions he showed he took one of the muskets from Tony shouldered and aimed it at the young man who stood like the accusing angel upon the rock	173.43723505540035
Athos threw himself on the muzzle of the gun and arrested the shot which was about to be fired	98.65873553637998
The devil take you said Aramis	1700.179240825604
I had him so well at the point of my gun I should have sent a ball into his breast	49.56596772345068
It is enough to have killed the mother said Athos hoarsely	983.9705811497863
The mother was a wretch who struck at us all and at those dear to us	190.48975553758152
Yes but the son has done us no harm	134.41165711999813
Grimaud who had risen to watch the effect of the shot fell back hopeless wringing his hands	134.56876039761065
The young man burst into a laugh	45.336607060763235
Ah it is certainly you he cried	152.79772098845152
I know you even better now	230.77219279059
His mocking laugh and threatening words passed over their heads carried by the breeze until lost in the depths of the horizon	100.54813545919248
Be calm exclaimed Athos for Heavens sake have we ceased to be men	153.63590507992825
No said Aramis but that fellow is a fiend and ask the uncle whether I was wrong to rid him of his dear nephew	225.53099841451777
De Winter only replied by a groan	26.09448204298232
It was all up with him continued Aramis ah I much fear that with all your wisdom such mercy yet will prove supernal folly	671.0935933279279
Athos took Lord de Winters hand and tried to turn the conversation	49.65130030593777
When shall we land in England he asked but De Winter seemed not to hear his words and made no reply	112.51264325280106
Hold Athos said Aramis perhaps there is yet time	176.87836195627148
See if he is still in the same place	37.01087015700404
Athos turned around with an effort the sight of the young man was evidently painful to him and there he still was in fact on the rock the beacon shedding around him as it were a doubtful aureole	138.5384897419389
Decidedly Aramis said Athos I think I was wrong not to let you fire	81.80424098107183
Hold your tongue replied Aramis you would make me weep if such a thing were possible	88.65830755337646
At this moment they were hailed by a voice from the sloop and a few seconds later men servants and baggage were aboard	296.87264850004294
The captain was only waiting for his passengers hardly had they put foot on deck ere her head was turned towards Hastings where they were to disembark	323.34674489894877
At this instant the three friends turned in spite of themselves a last look on the rock upon the menacing figure which pursued them and now stood out with a distinctness still	157.95028881691218
Then a voice reached them once more sending this threat To our next meeting sirs in England	950.4087815291118
Te Deum for the Victory of Lens	51.57034236830769
The bustle which had been observed by Henrietta Maria and for which she had vainly sought to discover a reason was occasioned by the battle of Lens announced by the princes messenger the Duc de Chatillon who had taken such a noble part in the engagement he was besides charged to hang five and twenty flags taken from the Lorraine party as well as from the Spaniards upon the arches of Notre Dame	202.58913387725715
Such news was decisive it destroyed in favor of the court the struggle commenced with parliament	526.8652969437543
The motive given for all the taxes summarily imposed and to which the parliament had made opposition was the necessity of sustaining the honor of France and the uncertain hope of beating the enemy	288.46769632886264
Now since the affair of Nordlingen they had experienced nothing but reverses the parliament had a plea for calling Mazarin to account for imaginary victories always promised ever deferred but this time there really had been fighting a triumph and a complete one	584.6870739410185
And this all knew so well that it was a double victory for the court a victory at home and abroad so that even when the young king learned the news he exclaimed Ah gentlemen of the parliament we shall see what you will say now Upon which the queen had pressed the royal child to her heart whose haughty and unruly sentiments were in such harmony with her own	194.29051620941436
A council was called on the same evening but nothing transpired of what had been decided on	88.64980740755784
It was only known that on the following Sunday a Te Deum would be sung at Notre Dame in honor of the victory of Lens	132.01618161796983
The following Sunday then the Parisians arose with joy at that period a Te Deum was a grand affair this kind of ceremony had not then been abused and it produced a great effect	147.77930334555688
The shops were deserted houses closed every one wished to see the young king with his mother and the famous Cardinal Mazarin whom they hated so much that no one wished to be deprived of his presence	73.7710899918858
Moreover great liberty prevailed throughout the immense crowd every opinion was openly expressed and chorused so to speak of coming insurrection as the thousand bells of all the Paris churches rang out the Te Deum	496.1707606444177
The police belonging to the city being formed by the city itself nothing threatening presented itself to disturb this concert of universal hatred or freeze the frequent scoffs of slanderous lips	830.6329347395489
Nevertheless at eight oclock in the morning the regiment of the queens guards commanded by Guitant under whom was his nephew Comminges marched publicly preceded by drums and trumpets filing off from the Palais Royal as far as Notre Dame a manoeuvre which the Parisians witnessed tranquilly delighted as they were with military music and brilliant uniforms	522.9546455505637
Friquet had put on his Sunday clothes under the pretext of having a swollen face which he had managed to simulate by introducing a handful of cherry kernels into one side of his mouth and had procured a whole holiday from Bazin	368.59555302898826
On leaving Bazin Friquet started off to the Palais Royal where he arrived at the moment of the turning out of the regiment of guards and as he had only gone there for the enjoyment of seeing it and hearing the music he took his place at their head beating the drum on two pieces of slate and passing from that exercise to that of the trumpet which he counterfeited quite naturally with his mouth in a manner which had more than once called forth the praises of amateurs of imitative harmony	119.58741197569435
This amusement lasted from the Barriere des Sergens to the place of Notre Dame and Friquet found in it very real enjoyment but when at last the regiment separated penetrated the heart of the city and placed itself at the extremity of the Rue Saint Christophe near the Rue Cocatrix in which Broussel lived then Friquet remembered that he had not had breakfast and after thinking in which direction he had better turn his steps in order to accomplish this important act of the day he reflected deeply and decided that Councillor Broussel should bear the cost of this repast	212.89423391854857
In consequence he took to his heels arrived breathlessly at the councillors door and knocked violently	476.44280149675205
His mother the councillors old servant opened it	180.62942040220955
What doest thou here goodfornothing she said and why art thou not at Notre Dame	116.61531679359035
I have been there mother said Friquet but I saw things happen of which Master Broussel ought to be warned and so with Monsieur Bazins permissionyou know mother Monsieur Bazin the vergerI came to speak to Monsieur Broussel	730.2730017486222
And what hast thou to say boy to Monsieur Broussel	1184.1102653340681
I wish to tell him replied Friquet screaming with all his might that there is a whole regiment of guards coming this way	593.081328998061
And as I hear everywhere that at the court they are illdisposed to him I wish to warn him that he may be on his guard	66.07820927483682
Broussel heard the scream of the young oddity and enchanted with this excess of zeal came down to the first floor for he was in truth working in his room on the second	165.34945534313962
Well said he friend what matters the regiment of guards to us and art thou not mad to make such a disturbance Knowest thou not that it is the custom of these soldiers to act thus and that it is usual for the regiment to form themselves into two solid walls when the king goes by	268.4695336060297
Friquet counterfeited surprise and twisting his new cap around in his fingers said	128.18705460231584
It is not astonishing for you to know it Monsieur Broussel who knows everything but as for me by holy truth I did not know it and I thought I would give you good advice you must not be angry with me for that Monsieur Broussel	73.98208442459423
On the contrary my boy on the contrary I am pleased with your zeal	59.00861882514223
Dame Nanette look for those apricots which Madame de Longueville sent to us yesterday from Noisy and give half a dozen of them to your son with a crust of new bread	216.6067893996716
Oh thank you sir thank you Monsieur Broussel said Friquet I am so fond of apricots	266.2506681328752
Broussel then proceeded to his wifes room and asked for breakfast it was nine oclock	84.84382943963448
The councillor placed himself at the window the street was completely deserted but in the distance was heard like the noise of the tide rushing in the deep hum of the populous waves increasing now around Notre Dame	122.07547512383417
This noise redoubled when DArtagnan with a company of musketeers placed himself at the gates of Notre Dame to secure the service of the church	83.66218758109926
He had instructed Porthos to profit by this opportunity to see the ceremony and Porthos in full dress mounted his finest horse taking the part of supernumerary musketeer as DArtagnan had so often done formerly	261.1250038645538
The sergeant of this company a veteran of the Spanish wars had recognized Porthos his old companion and very soon all those who served under him were placed in possession of startling facts concerning the honor of the ancient musketeers of Trville	245.76714643201
Porthos had not only been well received by the company but he was moreover looked on with great admiration	172.13181668184433
At ten oclock the guns of the Louvre announced the departure of the king and then a movement similar to that of trees in a stormy wind that bend and writhe with agitated tops ran though the multitude which was compressed behind the immovable muskets of the guard	254.75815518184737
At last the king appeared with the queen in a gilded chariot	202.85254295383518
Ten other carriages followed containing the ladies of honor the officers of the royal household and the court	86.87356527288046
God save the king was the cry in every direction the young monarch gravely put his head out of the window looked sufficiently grateful and even bowed at which the cries of the multitude were renewed	155.32437264393025
Just as the court was settling down in the cathedral a carriage bearing the arms of Comminges quitted the line of the court carriages and proceeded slowly to the end of the Rue Saint Christophe now entirely deserted	175.75132400489485
When it arrived there four guards and a police officer who accompanied it mounted into the heavy machine and closed the shutters then through an opening cautiously made the policeman began to watch the length of the Rue Cocatrix as if he was waiting for some one	154.98013361764114
All the world was occupied with the ceremony so that neither the chariot nor the precautions taken by those who were within it had been observed	154.45645683246872
Friquet whose eye ever on the alert could alone have discovered them had gone to devour his apricots upon the entablature of a house in the square of Notre Dame	148.5807155892402
Thence he saw the king the queen and Monsieur Mazarin and heard the mass as well as if he had been on duty	101.9707106872592
Toward the end of the service the queen seeing Comminges standing near her waiting for a confirmation of the order she had given him before quitting the Louvre said in a whisper	207.29874556260555
Go Comminges and may God aid you	100.00117465302394
Comminges immediately left the church and entered the Rue Saint Christophe	69.71473538170493
Friquet seeing this fine officer thus walk away followed by two guards amused himself by pursuing them and did this so much the more gladly as the ceremony ended at that instant and the king remounted his carriage	238.36014956090372
Hardly had the police officer observed Comminges at the end of the Rue Cocatrix when he said one word to the coachman who at once put his vehicle into motion and drove up before Broussels door	129.36985054857254
Comminges knocked at the door at the same moment and Friquet was waiting behind Comminges until the door should be opened	95.59194543256491
What dost thou there rascal asked Comminges	128.0699289434915
I want to go into Master Broussels house captain replied Friquet in that wheedling way the gamins of Paris know so well how to assume when necessary	1284.8021900480294
And on what floor does he live asked Comminges	322.6143950134799
In the whole house said Friquet the house belongs to him he occupies the second floor when he works and descends to the first to take his meals he must be at dinner now it is noon	237.92433630429207
At this moment the door was opened and having questioned the servant the officer learned that Master Broussel was at home and at dinner	162.13842071801488
Broussel was seated at the table with his family having his wife opposite to him his two daughters by his side and his son Louvieres whom we have already seen when the accident happened to the councilloran accident from which he had quite recoveredat the bottom of the table	126.04527486027315
The worthy man restored to perfect health was tasting the fine fruit which Madame de Longueville had sent to him	222.77291535348755
At sight of the officer Broussel was somewhat moved but seeing him bow politely he rose and bowed also	497.4262471782595
Still in spite of this reciprocal politeness the countenances of the women betrayed a certain amount of uneasiness Louvieres became very pale and waited impatiently for the officer to explain himself	245.4748948202132
Sir said Comminges I am the bearer of an order from the king	79.43523846537599
Very well sir replied Broussel what is this order And he held out his hand	61.16949553026608
I am commissioned to seize your person sir said Comminges in the same tone and with the same politeness and if you will believe me you had better spare yourself the trouble of reading that long letter and follow me	71.64192876343813
A thunderbolt falling in the midst of these good people so peacefully assembled there would not have produced a more appalling effect	264.9214903848833
It was a horrible thing at that period to be imprisoned by the enmity of the king	81.579131603491
Louvieres sprang forward to snatch his sword which stood against a chair in a corner of the room but a glance from the worthy Broussel who in the midst of it all did not lose his presence of mind checked this foolhardy action of despair	87.5228735360036
Madame Broussel separated by the width of the table from her husband burst into tears and the young girls clung to their fathers arms	62.0486772018294
Come sir said Comminges make haste you must obey the king	131.6117928492338
Sir said Broussel I am in bad health and can not give myself up a prisoner in this state I must have time	69.19929332430016
It is impossible said Comminges the order is strict and must be put into execution this instant	215.02183245330676
Impossible said Louvieres sir beware of driving us to despair	467.1839956535915
Impossible cried a shrill voice from the end of the room	8.301573499597867
Comminges turned and saw Dame Nanette her eyes flashing with anger and a broom in her hand	105.61473913536227
My good Nanette be quiet I beseech you said Broussel	139.43530189878823
Me keep quiet while my master is being arrested he the support the liberator the father of the people Ah well yes you have to know me yet	143.06060402015373
Are you going added she to Comminges	1650.1418663689926
Come sir said he addressing Broussel silence that woman and follow me	1898.9840454296377
Silence me me me said Nanette	319491.87239173375
Ah yet one wants some one besides you for that my fine kings cockatoo You shall see	366.74011721029075
And Dame Nanette sprang to the window threw it open and in such a piercing voice that it might have been heard in the square of Notre Dame	65.95784897173411
Help she screamed my master is being arrested the Councillor Broussel is being arrested Help	879.9594289941991
Sir said Comminges declare yourself at once will you obey or do you intend to rebel against the king	177.6794928607327
I obey I obey sir cried Broussel trying to disengage himself from the grasp of his two daughters and by a look restrain his son who seemed determined to dispute authority	210.72429693861292
In that case commanded Comminges silence that old woman	621.3166756279941
And she began to shriek more loudly clinging to the bars of the window	75.81406878820245
Help help for Master Broussel who is arrested because he has defended the people Help	305.7270262296443
Comminges seized the servant around the waist and would have dragged her from her post but at that instant a treble voice proceeding from a kind of entresol was heard screeching	258.1486480733002
Murder fire assassins Master Broussel is being killed Master Broussel is being strangled	873.6465612035913
It was Friquets voice and Dame Nanette feeling herself supported recommenced with all her strength to sound her shrilly squawk	1498.6287467053835
Many curious faces had already appeared at the windows and the people attracted to the end of the street began to run first men then groups and then a crowd of people hearing cries and seeing a chariot they could not understand it but Friquet sprang from the entresol on to the top of the carriage	122.87494489349572
They want to arrest Master Broussel he cried the guards are in the carriage and the officer is upstairs	188.7644013551439
The crowd began to murmur and approached the house	35.56104179045724
The two guards who had remained in the lane mounted to the aid of Comminges those who were in the chariot opened the doors and presented arms	105.50780387072207
Do nt you see them cried Friquet do nt you see there they are	77.68304733376333
The coachman turning around gave Friquet a slash with his whip which made him scream with pain	388.16603456480675
Ah devils coachman cried Friquet you re meddling too Wait	3460.7981228213025
And regaining his entresol he overwhelmed the coachman with every projectile he could lay hands on	222.69785144570508
The tumult now began to increase the street was not able to contain the spectators who assembled from every direction the crowd invaded the space which the dreaded pikes of the guards had till then kept clear between them and the carriage	208.9361984971941
The soldiers pushed back by these living walls were in danger of being crushed against the spokes of the wheels and the panels of the carriages	140.9368670186999
The cries which the police officer repeated twenty times In the kings name were powerless against this formidable multitudeseemed on the contrary to exasperate it still more when at the shout In the name of the king an officer ran up and seeing the uniforms illtreated he sprang into the scuffle sword in hand and brought unexpected help to the guards	331.5565340937688
This gentleman was a young man scarcely sixteen years of age now white with anger	71.16342799245155
He leaped from his charger placed his back against the shaft of the carriage making a rampart of his horse drew his pistols from their holsters and fastened them to his belt and began to fight with the back sword like a man accustomed to the handling of his weapon	79.70769435809316
During ten minutes he alone kept the crowd at bay at last Comminges appeared pushing Broussel before him	785.5950089908288
Let us break the carriage cried the people	135.34748272972206
In the kings name cried Comminges	14116.942609894397
The first who advances is a dead man cried Raoul for it was in fact he who feeling himself pressed and almost crushed by a gigantic citizen pricked him with the point of his sword and sent him howling back	157.9424874635461
Comminges so to speak threw Broussel into the carriage and sprang in after him	145.66007077756487
At this moment a shot was fired and a ball passed through the hat of Comminges and broke the arm of one of the guards	51.78555605948279
Comminges looked up and saw amidst the smoke the threatening face of Louvieres appearing at the window of the second floor	104.35500461050864
Very well sir said Comminges you shall hear of this anon	171.38512028177465
And you of me sir said Louvieres and we shall see then who can speak the loudest	255.80401877525205
Friquet and Nanette continued to shout the cries the noise of the shot and the intoxicating smell of powder produced their usual maddening effects	387.2675059294802
Down with the officer down with him was the cry	96.04653203624123
One step nearer said Comminges putting down the sashes that the interior of the carriage might be well seen and placing his sword on his prisoners breast one step nearer and I kill the prisoner my orders were to carry him off alive or dead	146.9100301554751
I will take him dead that s all	102.01833865821123
A terrible cry was heard and the wife and daughters of Broussel held up their hands in supplication to the people the latter knew that this officer who was so pale but who appeared so determined would keep his word they continued to threaten but they began to disperse	140.21989036411358
Drive to the palace said Comminges to the coachman who was by then more dead than alive	148.30240287695523
The man whipped his animals which cleared a way through the crowd but on arriving on the Quai they were obliged to stop the carriage was upset the horses carried off stifled mangled by the crowd	172.91670348418663
Raoul on foot for he had not time to mount his horse again tired like the guards of distributing blows with the flat of his sword had recourse to its point	253.25456005855963
But this last and dreaded resource served only to exasperate the multitude	1085.6939002183633
From time to time a shot from a musket or the blade of a rapier flashed among the crowd projectiles continued to hail down from the windows and some shots were heard the echo of which though they were probably fired in the air made all hearts vibrate	199.56341091681384
Voices unheard except on days of revolution were distinguished faces were seen that only appeared on days of bloodshed	634.0471485052626
Cries of Death death to the guards to the Seine with the officer were heard above all the noise deafening as it was	129.15701056413727
Raoul his hat in ribbons his face bleeding felt not only his strength but also his reason going a red mist covered his sight and through this mist he saw a hundred threatening arms stretched over him ready to seize upon him when he fell	168.51478508648208
The guards were unable to help any oneeach one was occupied with his selfpreservation	404.24076901347445
All was over carriages horses guards and perhaps even the prisoner were about to be torn to shreds when all at once a voice well known to Raoul was heard and suddenly a great sword glittered in the air at the same time the crowd opened upset trodden down and an officer of the musketeers striking and cutting right and left rushed up to Raoul and took him in his arms just as he was about to fall	149.0703970300654
Gods blood cried the officer have they killed him Woe to them if it be so	227.19638606626083
And he turned around so stern with anger strength and threat that the most excited rebels hustled back on one another in order to escape and some of them even rolled into the Seine	261.9411937967106
Yes sdeath in person and fortunately it seems for you my young friend	144.28413313762414
Come on here you others he continued rising in his stirrups raising his sword and addressing those musketeers who had not been able to follow his rapid onslaught	195.67272434757925
Come sweep away all that for me Shoulder muskets Present arms Aim	9111.841792477286
At this command the mountain of populace thinned so suddenly that DArtagnan could not repress a burst of Homeric laughter	516.7303444842253
Thank you DArtagnan said Comminges showing half of his body through the window of the broken vehicle thanks my young friend your namethat I may mention it to the queen	164.0134168531478
Raoul was about to reply when DArtagnan bent down to his ear	141.58316935481176
Hold your tongue said he and let me answer	88.77857755632711
Do not lose time Comminges he continued get out of the carriage if you can and make another draw up be quick or in five minutes the mob will be on us again with swords and muskets and you will be killed	128.19178552851807
Hold there s a carriage coming over yonder	1304.8276181386723
Then bending again to Raoul he whispered Above all things do not divulge your name	276.3682561158632
I will go said Comminges and if they come back fire	138.71206447661302
Not at allnot at all replied DArtagnan let no one move	501.3536000120297
On the contrary one shot at this moment would be paid for dearly tomorrow	166.77191665556555
Comminges took his four guards and as many musketeers and ran to the carriage from which he made the people inside dismount and brought them to the vehicle which had upset	186.0195249868488
But when it was necessary to convey the prisoner from one carriage to the other the people catching sight of him whom they called their liberator uttered every imaginable cry and knotted themselves once more around the vehicle	360.9000118811435
There are ten men to accompany you	69.2820602462591
I will keep twenty to hold in check the mob go and lose not a moment	400.0801264313524
Ten men for Monsieur de Comminges	3705.3574800563583
As the carriage started off the cries were redoubled and more than ten thousand people thronged the Quai and overflowed the Pont Neuf and adjacent streets	454.19746582184223
A few shots were fired and one musketeer was wounded	617.185843256329
Forward cried DArtagnan driven to extremities biting his moustache and then he charged with his twenty men and dispersed them in fear	251.91505496629847
One man alone remained in his place gun in hand	241.7556334438533
Ah he exclaimed it is thou who wouldst have him assassinated Wait an instant	2541.196834707397
And he pointed his gun at DArtagnan who was riding toward him at full speed	146.5975461293672
DArtagnan bent down to his horses neck the young man fired and the ball severed the feathers from the hat	215.0299961641315
The horse started brushed against the imprudent man who thought by his strength alone to stay the tempest and he fell against the wall	87.7695063063476
DArtagnan pulled up his horse and whilst his musketeers continued to charge he returned and bent with drawn sword over the man he had knocked down	229.67654935916988
Oh sir exclaimed Raoul recognizing the young man as having seen him in the Rue Cocatrix spare him it is his son	72.89822458721378
DArtagnans arm dropped to his side	87.44151359428083
Ah you are his son he said that is a different thing	40.00910597026225
Sir I surrender said Louvieres presenting his unloaded musket to the officer	896.4068104234826
Eh no do not surrender egad On the contrary be off and quickly	686.0039302444756
If I take you you will be hung	58.328527669723044
The young man did not wait to be told twice but passing under the horses head disappeared at the corner of the Rue Guenegaud	88.15722048077589
Ifaith said DArtagnan to Raoul you were just in time to stay my hand	92.9475064675547
He was a dead man and on my honor if I had discovered that it was his son I should have regretted having killed him	54.87627039237824
Ah sir said Raoul allow me after thanking you for that poor fellows life to thank you on my own account	108.93703230414826
I too sir was almost dead when you arrived	105.80614264598327
Wait wait young man do not fatigue yourself with speaking	259.6487974593131
We can talk of it afterward	890300.3150504081
Then seeing that the musketeers had cleared the Quai from the Pont Neuf to the Quai Saint Michael he raised his sword for them to double their speed	185.60499274047314
The musketeers trotted up and at the same time the ten men whom DArtagnan had given to Comminges appeared	75.73354535382903
Halloo cried DArtagnan has something fresh happened	2741.639187278487
Eh sir replied the sergeant their vehicle has broken down a second time it really must be doomed	351.26072669646595
They are bad managers said DArtagnan shrugging his shoulders	49.10772797003996
When a carriage is chosen it ought to be strong	63.721824379417576
The carriage in which a Broussel is to be arrested ought to be able to bear ten thousand men	109.26068634728298
Take the detachment and conduct him to his place	23.523850795491043
But you will be left alone	67.30658514784756
So you suppose I have need of an escort Go	910.981726737241
The musketeers set off and DArtagnan was left alone with Raoul	253.3827073131662
Now he said are you in pain	1907.269988265636
Yes my head is not only swimming but burning	1930.5378147638542
What s the matter with this head said DArtagnan raising the battered hat	443.303370400884
Yes I think I received a flowerpot upon my head	198.767085132082
But were you not on horseback you have spurs	405.3690214313282
Yes but I got down to defend Monsieur de Comminges and my horse was taken away	156.84798663491023
At this very moment Friquet passed mounted on Raouls horse waving his particolored cap and crying Broussel Broussel	2080.7514445858505
Friquet heard perfectly but he pretended not to do so and tried to continue his road	134.41045539150883
DArtagnan felt inclined for an instant to pursue Master Friquet but not wishing to leave Raoul alone he contented himself with taking a pistol from the holster and cocking it	187.64345260790304
Friquet had a quick eye and a fine ear	257.7929200515464
He saw DArtagnans movement heard the sound of the click and stopped at once	36.80365417227684
Ah it is you your honor he said advancing toward DArtagnan and I am truly pleased to meet you	141.3473694915441
DArtagnan looked attentively at Friquet and recognized the little chorister of the Rue de la Calandre	70.37422305052684
Ah tis thou rascal said he come here so thou hast changed thy trade thou art no longer a choir boy nor a tavern boy thou hast become a horse stealer	527.1108872022841
Ah your honor how can you say so exclaimed Friquet	193.48989315163374
I was seeking the gentleman to whom this horse belongsan officer brave and handsome as a youthful Caesar then pretending to see Raoul for the first time	334.4027722003641
Ah but if I mistake not continued he here he is you wo nt forget the boy sir	135.93336192522196
Raoul put his hand in his pocket	7.663156093810178
What are you about asked DArtagnan	5520.992813693361
To give ten francs to this honest fellow replied Raoul taking a pistole from his pocket	205.61489481928115
Ten kicks on his back said DArtagnan be off you little villain and forget not that I have your address	430.39504502684116
Friquet who did not expect to be let off so cheaply bounded off like a gazelle up the Quai a la Rue Dauphine and disappeared	424.7966876545307
Raoul mounted his horse and both leisurely took their way to the Rue Tiquetonne	143.8487515332864
DArtagnan watched over the youth as if he had been his own son	19.01586768378865
They arrived without accident at the Hotel de la Chevrette	27.583600848679172
The handsome Madeleine announced to DArtagnan that Planchet had returned bringing Mousqueton with him who had heroically borne the extraction of the ball and was as well as his state would permit	256.19455430793005
DArtagnan desired Planchet to be summoned but he had disappeared	83.91141408808292
Then bring some wine said DArtagnan	4782.739524382104
You are much pleased with yourself said he to Raoul when they were alone are you not	83.6313403363941
It seems to me I did my duty	100.40556597688614
And who told you to defend the king	115.35877262332096
The Comte de la Fere himself	1693.3045859055203
Yes the king but today you have not fought for the king you have fought for Mazarin which is not quite the same thing	93.0653216115964
Oh for me that is another matter	664.5047551762696
As for you your captain is the prince understand that rightly you have no other	162.8469123071983
But has one ever seen such a wild fellow continued he making himself a Mazarinist and helping to arrest Broussel Breathe not a word of that or the Comte de la Fere will be furious	230.36943030014578
You think the count will be angry with me	24.83158693988135
Think it I m certain of it were it not for that I should thank you for you have worked for us	46.17075780421745
However I scold you instead of him and in his place the storm will blow over more easily believe me	216.51590258837592
And moreover my dear child continued DArtagnan I am making use of the privilege conceded to me by your guardian	179.18164144827557
I do not understand you sir said Raoul	104.4529836645779
DArtagnan rose and taking a letter from his writingdesk presented it to Raoul	199.8148208942602
The face of the latter became serious when he had cast his eyes upon the paper	55.3726164941606
Oh mon Dieu he said raising his fine eyes to DArtagnan moist with tears the count has left Paris without seeing me	109.62672128367906
He left four days ago said DArtagnan	297.03735587458647
But this letter seems to intimate that he is about to incur danger perhaps death	465.1503724573863
Heheincur danger of death No be not anxious he is traveling on business and will return ere long	383.64343962854815
I hope you have no repugnance to accept me as your guardian in the interim	227.23517970642772
Oh no Monsieur dArtagnan said Raoul you are such a brave gentleman and the Comte de la Fere has so much affection for you	47.0402158848882
Eh Egad love me too I will not torment you much but only on condition that you become a Frondist my young friend and a hearty Frondist too	260.0787140721839
But can I continue to visit Madame de Chevreuse	135.1101026379117
I should say you could and the coadjutor and Madame de Longueville and if the worthy Broussel were there whom you so stupidly helped arrest I should tell you to excuse yourself to him at once and kiss him on both cheeks	180.8535439351956
Well sir I will obey you although I do not understand you	13.51245551413236
It is unnecessary for you to understand	16.229044872515942
Hold continued DArtagnan turning toward the door which had just opened here is Monsieur du Vallon who comes with his coat torn	78.16605490248179
Yes but in exchange said Porthos covered with perspiration and soiled by dust in exchange I have torn many skins	370.19034808156823
Those wretches wanted to take away my sword Deuce take em what a popular commotion continued the giant in his quiet manner but I knocked down more than twenty with the hilt of Balizarde	483.59976176194766
Oh Ill answer for you said the Gascon filling Porthoss glass to the brim but when you have drunk give me your opinion	291.511064314095
Look here resumed DArtagnan here is Monsieur de Bragelonne who determined at all risks to aid the arrest of Broussel and whom I had great difficulty to prevent defending Monsieur de Comminges	203.9452520191062
The devil said Porthos and his guardian what would he have said to that	106.39334207820902
Do you hear interrupted DArtagnan become a Frondist my friend belong to the Fronde and remember that I fill the counts place in everything and he jingled his money	288.1630885667912
Will you come said he to Porthos	1246.5787682442235
Where asked Porthos filling a second glass of wine	34.72863718625597
To present our respects to the cardinal	96.07437243238772
Porthos swallowed the second glass with the same grace with which he had imbibed the first took his beaver and followed DArtagnan	155.07308048276658
As for Raoul he remained bewildered with what he had seen having been forbidden by DArtagnan to leave the room until the tumult was over	123.85487960299221
DArtagnan had calculated that in not going at once to the Palais Royal he would give Comminges time to arrive before him and consequently to make the cardinal acquainted with the eminent services which he DArtagnan and his friend had rendered to the queens party in the morning	162.94159175649497
They were indeed admirably received by Mazarin who paid them numerous compliments and announced that they were more than half on their way to obtain what they desired namely DArtagnan his captaincy Porthos his barony	330.9319945749508
DArtagnan would have preferred money in hand to all that fine talk for he knew well that to Mazarin it was easy to promise and hard to perform	194.7046125663598
But though he held the cardinals promises as of little worth he affected to be completely satisfied for he was unwilling to discourage Porthos	710.9351557308245
Whilst the two friends were with the cardinal the queen sent for him	134.26399912629094
Mazarin thinking that it would be the means of increasing the zeal of his two defenders if he procured them personal thanks from the queen motioned them to follow him	202.57551977755625
DArtagnan and Porthos pointed to their dusty and torn dresses but the cardinal shook his head	280.5418210592003
Those costumes he said are of more worth than most of those which you will see on the backs of the queens courtiers they are costumes of battle	178.814273446031
The court of Anne of Austria was full of gayety and animation for after having gained a victory over the Spaniard it had just gained another over the people	155.74138061091878
Broussel had been conducted out of Paris without further resistance and was at this time in the prison of Saint Germain while Blancmesnil who was arrested at the same time but whose arrest had been made without difficulty or noise was safe in the Castle of Vincennes	97.66026110788918
Comminges was near the queen who was questioning him upon the details of his expedition and every one was listening to his account when DArtagnan and Porthos were perceived at the door behind the cardinal	117.22205522606997
Ah madame said Comminges hastening to DArtagnan here is one who can tell you better than myself for he was my protector	92.87149222931622
Without him I should probably at this moment be a dead fish in the nets at Saint Cloud for it was a question of nothing less than throwing me into the river	132.45018544815818
DArtagnan had been a hundred times in the same room with the queen since he had become lieutenant of the musketeers but her majesty had never once spoken to him	72.17738557473612
Well sir at last said Anne of Austria you are silent after rendering such a service	177.1240865794665
Madame replied DArtagnan I have nought to say save that my life is ever at your majestys service and that I shall only be happy the day I lose it for you	87.56577522714723
I know that sir I have known that said the queen a long time therefore I am delighted to be able thus publicly to mark my gratitude and my esteem	114.85294875316158
Permit me madame said DArtagnan to reserve a portion for my friend like myself he laid an emphasis on these words an ancient musketeer of the company of Trville he has done wonders	245.60156384351274
In the regiment said DArtagnan he is called Porthos the queen started but his true name is the Chevalier du Vallon	189.29116236019428
De Bracieux de Pierrefonds added Porthos	13400.201926022755
These names are too numerous for me to remember them all and I will content myself with the first said the queen graciously	84.50049556125941
At this moment the coadjutor was announced a cry of surprise ran through the royal assemblage	95.64908584450608
Although the coadjutor had preached that same morning it was well known that he leaned much to the side of the Fronde and Mazarin in requesting the archbishop of Paris to make his nephew preach had evidently had the intention of administering to Monsieur de Retz one of those Italian kicks he so much enjoyed giving	252.91533260246499
The fact was in leaving Notre Dame the coadjutor had learned the event of the day	113.54478234505764
Although almost engaged to the leaders of the Fronde he had not gone so far but that retreat was possible should the court offer him the advantages for which he was ambitious and to which the coadjutorship was but a steppingstone	170.65203987185308
Monsieur de Retz wished to become archbishop in his uncles place and cardinal like Mazarin and the popular party could with difficulty accord him favors so entirely royal	1239.6505305744843
He therefore hastened to the palace to congratulate the queen on the battle of Lens determined beforehand to act with or against the court as his congratulations were well or ill received	398.3680434252416
The coadjutor possessed perhaps as much wit as all those put together who were assembled at the court to laugh at him	115.9570849673236
His speech therefore was so well turned that in spite of the great wish felt by the courtiers to laugh they could find no point on which to vent their ridicule	195.86947526112448
He concluded by saying that he placed his feeble influence at her majestys command	298.3468090475974
During the whole time he was speaking the queen appeared to be well pleased with the coadjutors harangue but terminating as it did with such a phrase the only one which could be caught at by the jokers Anne turned around and directed a glance toward her favorites which announced that she delivered up the coadjutor to their tender mercies	343.5349795157596
Immediately the wits of the court plunged into satire	2631.0311753725796
NogentBeautin the fool of the court exclaimed that the queen was very happy to have the succor of religion at such a moment	93.0832046830247
This caused a universal burst of laughter	36.459715871635126
The Count de Villeroy said that he did not know how any fear could be entertained for a moment when the court had to defend itself against the parliament and the citizens of Paris his holiness the coadjutor who by a signal could raise an army of curates church porters and vergers	152.58723341295433
The Marechal de la Meilleraie added that in case the coadjutor should appear on the field of battle it would be a pity that he should not be distinguished in the melee by wearing a red hat as Henry IV	122.7513081971124
had been distinguished by his white plume at the battle of Ivry	510.3553258550363
During this storm Gondy who had it in his power to make it most unpleasant for the jesters remained calm and stern	159.31764065409646
The queen at last asked him if he had anything to add to the fine discourse he had just made to her	85.87201217083786
Yes madame replied the coadjutor I have to beg you to reflect twice ere you cause a civil war in the kingdom	148.61857363148096
The queen turned her back and the laughing recommenced	1340.407262585121
The coadjutor bowed and left the palace casting upon the cardinal such a glance as is best understood by mortal foes	356.4588226592775
That glance was so sharp that it penetrated the heart of Mazarin who reading in it a declaration of war seized DArtagnan by the arm and said	187.30142004767956
If occasion requires monsieur you will remember that man who has just gone out will you not	32.93678320836226
Then turning toward Porthos The devil said he this has a bad look	210.41318427688714
I dislike these quarrels among men of the church	37.242813467171516
Gondy withdrew distributing benedictions on his way and finding a malicious satisfaction in causing the adherents of his foes to prostrate themselves at his feet	223.07750740922458
Oh he murmured as he left the threshold of the palace ungrateful court faithless court cowardly court I will teach you how to laugh tomorrowbut in another manner	592.3311899230264
But whilst they were indulging in extravagant joy at the Palais Royal to increase the hilarity of the queen Mazarin a man of sense and whose fear moreover gave him foresight lost no time in making idle and dangerous jokes he went out after the coadjutor settled his account locked up his gold and had confidential workmen to contrive hiding places in his walls	386.2133805808515
On his return home the coadjutor was informed that a young man had come in after his departure and was waiting for him he started with delight when on demanding the name of this young man he learned that it was Louvieres	91.72415465960034
Broussels son was there still furious and still bearing bloody marks of his struggle with the kings officers	451.4360596908597
The only precaution he had taken in coming to the archbishopric was to leave his arquebuse in the hands of a friend	83.22020139682398
The coadjutor went to him and held out his hand	18.44009893075115
The young man gazed at him as if he would have read the secret of his heart	21.00507033601662
My dear Monsieur Louvieres said the coadjutor believe me I am truly concerned for the misfortune which has happened to you	76.49511157982802
Is that true and do you speak seriously asked Louvieres	435.5893424838553
From the depth of my heart said Gondy	263.2813188724979
In that case my lord the time for words has passed and the hour for action is at hand my lord in three days if you wish it my father will be out of prison and in six months you may be cardinal	95.96940273053904
Oh let us speak frankly continued Louvieres and act in a straightforward manner	503.01473800591236
Thirty thousand crowns in alms is not given as you have done for the last six months out of pure Christian charity that would be too grand	86.64092314881047
You are ambitiousit is natural you are a man of genius and you know your worth	63.24598610784184
As for me I hate the court and have but one desire at this momentvengeance	267.1722627161458
Give us the clergy and the people of whom you can dispose and I will bring you the citizens and the parliament with these four elements Paris is ours in a week and believe me monsieur coadjutor the court will give from fear what it will not give from goodwill	201.53828815994387
It was now the coadjutors turn to fix his piercing eyes on Louvieres	541.76572972855
But Monsieur Louvieres are you aware that it is simply civil war you are proposing to me	121.84288303739967
You have been preparing long enough my lord for it to be welcome to you now	79.77616858516397
Never mind said the coadjutor you must be well aware that this requires reflection	82.50314981548091
And how many hours of reflection do you ask	176.544734694717
Twelve hours sir is it too long	329.4544631961269
It is now noon at midnight I will be at your house	19.98907115103782
If I should not be in wait for me	62.21791311804299
At midnight my dear Monsieur Louvieres	95762.04144237805
When once more alone Gondy sent to summon all the curates with whom he had any connection to his house	100.92041769886536
Two hours later thirty officiating ministers from the most populous and consequently the most disturbed parishes of Paris had assembled there	250.98842968296418
Gondy related to them the insults he had received at the Palais Royal and retailed the jests of Beautin the Count de Villeroy and Marechal de la Meilleraie	270.90794935802205
The curates asked him what was to be done	30.405412578022556
You are the directors of all consciences	3009.2743541870495
Well undermine in them the miserable prejudice of respect and fear of kings teach your flocks that the queen is a tyrant and repeat often and loudly so that all may know it that the misfortunes of France are caused by Mazarin her lover and her destroyer begin this work today this instant even and in three days I shall expect the result	260.4315782368529
For the rest if any one of you have further or better counsel to expound I will listen to him with the greatest pleasure	101.80550435049832
You think then that you can help me more efficaciously than your brothers said Gondy	250.86694867761636
We hope so answered the curates	158904.09115772054
My lord I have in my parish a man who might be of the greatest use to you	117.84314308563656
Who and what is this man	31.561564268638232
A shopkeeper in the Rue des Lombards who has great influence upon the commerce of his quarter	130.33894087327158
He is named Planchet who himself also caused a rising about six weeks ago but as he was searched for after this emeute he disappeared	170.83772813587328
I think he has not been arrested and as I am his wifes confessor if she knows where he is I shall know it too	144.3339125288867
Very well sir find this man and when you have found him bring him to me	50.61375841044211
We will be with you at six oclock my lord	73.10661113439691
Go my dear curate and may God assist you	446.54281701065923
And you sir continued Gondy turning to the curate of St	74.12206020725112
I my lord said the latter I know a man who has rendered great services to a very popular prince and who would make an excellent leader of revolt	141.6481453824008
Him I can place at your disposal it is Count de Rochefort	63.531406235290746
I know him also but unfortunately he is not in Paris	74.99923114173285
My lord he has been for three days at the Rue Cassette	157.58227645861035
And wherefore has he not been to see me	63.234481863419404
He was toldmy lord will pardon me	14.667374169752042
That your lordship was about to treat with the court	70.20236955587798
They are mistaken bring him here at eight oclock sir and may Heaven bless you as I bless you	135.883860613279
And now tis your turn said the coadjutor turning to the last that remained have you anything as good to offer me as the two gentlemen who have left us	133.87238013312052
Diable think what a solemn engagement you are making one has offered a wealthy shopkeeper the other a count you are going then to offer a prince are you	257.06850670433437
I offer you a beggar my lord	77.86088628120922
Ah ah said Gondy reflecting you are right sir some one who could raise the legion of paupers who choke up the crossings of Paris some one who would know how to cry aloud to them that all France might hear it that it is Mazarin who has reduced them to poverty	143.9134231070407
A plain and simple beggar as I have said my lord who asks for alms as he gives holy water a practice he has carried on for six years on the steps of St	132.6353389444711
And you say that he has a great influence over his compeers	139.4857668215904
Are you aware my lord that mendacity is an organized body a kind of association of those who have nothing against those who have everything an association in which every one takes his share one that elects a leader	341.5366565250759
Yes I have heard it said replied the coadjutor	204.2639147098528
Well the man whom I offer you is a general syndic	615.4815715145778
And what do you know of him	49.25426787730412
Nothing my lord except that he is tormented with remorse	79.93727394163545
On the twentyeighth of every month he makes me say a mass for the repose of the soul of one who died a violent death yesterday I said this mass again	153.96673755959293
Maillard but I do not think it is his right one	41.34498231565298
And think you that we should find him at this hour at his post	58.48853362003411
Let us go and see your beggar sir and if he is such as you describe him you are rightit will be you who have discovered the true treasure	122.47431052669143
Gondy dressed himself as an officer put on a felt cap with a red feather hung on a long sword buckled spurs to his boots wrapped himself in an ample cloak and followed the curate	307.4120980113652
The coadjutor and his companion passed through all the streets lying between the archbishopric and the St	156.2337247821731
Eustache Church watching carefully to ascertain the popular feeling	242.6586389076832
The people were in an excited mood but like a swarm of frightened bees seemed not to know at what point to concentrate and it was very evident that if leaders of the people were not provided all this agitation would pass off in idle buzzing	333.16970682889405
On arriving at the Rue des Prouvaires the curate pointed toward the square before the church	401.72670550923
Stop he said there he is at his post	46.648521549854884
Gondy looked at the spot indicated and perceived a beggar seated in a chair and leaning against one of the moldings a little basin was near him and he held a holy water brush in his hand	140.37272634673405
Is it by permission that he remains there asked Gondy	898.1982102462263
No my lord these places are bought	199.37536834605115
I believe this man paid his predecessor a hundred pistoles for his	199.12724016835324
Some of those men sometimes die worth twenty thousand and twentyfive and thirty thousand francs and sometimes more	119.9271860296626
Hum said Gondy laughing I was not aware my alms were so well invested	201.9521077259471
In the meantime they were advancing toward the square and the moment the coadjutor and the curate put their feet on the first church step the mendicant arose and proffered his brush	414.65019117974873
He was a man between sixtysix and sixtyeight years of age little rather stout with gray hair and light eyes	230.17436282042155
His countenance denoted the struggle between two opposite principlesa wicked nature subdued by determination perhaps by repentance	4421.742622255413
He started on seeing the cavalier with the curate	489.341498521054
The latter and the coadjutor touched the brush with the tips of their fingers and made the sign of the cross the coadjutor threw a piece of money into the hat which was on the ground	50.500789707675814
Maillard began the curate this gentleman and I have come to talk with you a little	38.36592343325894
With me said the mendicant it is a great honor for a poor distributor of holy water	142.0856560677499
There was an ironical tone in his voice which he could not quite disguise and which astonished the coadjutor	85.67502736782414
Yes continued the curate apparently accustomed to this tone yes we wish to know your opinion of the events of today and what you have heard said by people going in and out of the church	110.95459246875954
These are melancholy doings your reverence which always fall again upon the poor	372.38263144538354
As to what is said everybody is discontented everybody complains but everybody means nobody	6281.953123584332
Explain yourself my good friend said the coadjutor	39.42817791737674
I mean that all these cries all these complaints these curses produce nothing but storms and flashes and that is all but the lightning will not strike until there is a hand to guide it	319.28075545181434
My friend said Gondy you seem to be a clever and a thoughtful man are you disposed to take a part in a little civil war should we have one and put at the command of the leader should we find one your personal influence and the influence you have acquired over your comrades	122.25020370622046
Yes sir provided this war were approved of by the church and would advance the end I wish to attainI mean the remission of my sins	380.32628490265216
The war will not only be approved of but directed by the church	319.5628045784888
As for the remission of your sins we have the archbishop of Paris who has the very greatest power at the court of Rome and even the coadjutor who possesses some plenary indulgences we will recommend you to him	214.5562335770094
Consider Maillard said the curate that I have recommended you to this gentleman who is a powerful lord and that I have made myself responsible for you	52.31021784947795
I know monsieur le cur said the beggar that you have always been very kind to me and therefore I in my turn will be serviceable to you	59.027229585644
And do you think your power as great with the fraternity as monsieur le cur told me it was just now	157.98103408748787
I think they have some esteem for me said the mendicant with pride and that not only will they obey me but wherever I go they will follow me	142.32477926631316
And could you count on fifty resolute men good unemployed but active souls brawlers capable of bringing down the walls of the Palais Royal by crying Down with Mazarin as fell those at Jericho	945.5015230680602
I think said the beggar I can undertake things more difficult and more important than that	121.08365220579476
Ah ah said Gondy you will undertake then some night to throw up some ten barricades	424.2621643795447
I will undertake to throw up fifty and when the day comes to defend them	166.03398357187083
Ifaith exclaimed Gondy you speak with a certainty that gives me pleasure and since monsieur le cur can answer for you	174.4518695527848
I answer for him said the curate	464.0945577777911
Here is a bag containing five hundred pistoles in gold make all your arrangements and tell me where I shall be able to find you this evening at ten oclock	36.59285095246296
It must be on some elevated place whence a given signal may be seen in every part of Paris	329.43679035553
Shall I give you a line for the vicar of St	367.0893199131681
Jacques de la Boucherie he will let you into the rooms in his tower said the curate	126.59013220807145
Then said the coadjutor this evening at ten oclock and if I am pleased with you another bag of five hundred pistoles will be at your disposal	62.12520422229006
The eyes of the mendicant dashed with cupidity but he quickly suppressed his emotion	636.9949858433688
This evening sir he replied all will be ready	87.46823397980516
At a quarter to six oclock Monsieur de Gondy having finished his business returned to the archiepiscopal palace	302.52454006883363
At six oclock the curate of St	22.67061945291399
The coadjutor glanced rapidly behind and saw that he was followed by another man	33.48178502714918
The curate then entered followed by Planchet	439.61309120105517
Your holiness said the curate here is the person of whom I had the honor to speak to you	21.623944372744575
Planchet saluted in the manner of one accustomed to fine houses	392.3675995770178
And you are disposed to serve the cause of the people asked Gondy	178.88134398617964
I am a Frondist from my heart	14.960480482199895
You see in me such as I am a person sentenced to be hung	120.93739791088977
I rescued from the hands of Mazarins police a noble lord whom they were conducting back to the Bastile where he had been for five years	116.73679860789183
Oh you know him well my lordit is Count de Rochefort	588.5701007582683
Ah really yes said the coadjutor I have heard this affair mentioned	69.48817742818916
You raised the whole district so they told me	84.54933608344892
Very nearly replied Planchet with a selfsatisfied air	189.6020960222738
That of a confectioner in the Rue des Lombards	26.924376879044342
Explain to me how it happens that following so peaceful a business you had such warlike inclinations	1525.0174742479119
Why does my lord belonging to the church now receive me in the dress of an officer with a sword at his side and spurs to his boots	86.25350707235138
Not badly answered ifaith said Gondy laughing but I have you must know always had in spite of my bands warlike inclinations	317.63323502794094
Well my lord before I became a confectioner I myself was three years sergeant in the Piedmontese regiment and before I became sergeant I was for eighteen months the servant of Monsieur dArtagnan	443.668009643105
The lieutenant of musketeers asked Gondy	29048.41191020034
But he is said to be a furious Mazarinist	860.2605329159363
What do you mean by that	17.51916728729563
Nothing my lord Monsieur dArtagnan belongs to the service Monsieur dArtagnan makes it his business to defend the cardinal who pays him as much as we make it ours we citizens to attack him whom he robs	268.78588635232
You are an intelligent fellow my friend can we count upon you	122.03720475538742
You may count upon me my lord provided you want to make a complete upheaval of the city	223.97696126372884
How many men think you you could collect together tonight	1579.398122060577
Two hundred muskets and five hundred halberds	1045.7993721137134
Let there be only one man in every district who can do as much and by tomorrow we shall have quite a powerful army	129.49594027425394
Are you disposed to obey Count de Rochefort	302.72593195149824
I would follow him to hell and that is saying not a little as I believe him entirely capable of the descent	184.837382748251
By what sign tomorrow shall we be able to distinguish friends from foes	364.9139113613346
Every Frondist must put a knot of straw in his hat	99.7060677782262
Money never comes amiss at any time my lord if one has it not one must do without it with it matters go on much better and more rapidly	179.10367120925923
Gondy went to a box and drew forth a bag	62.18145093890482
Here are five hundred pistoles he said and if the action goes off well you may reckon upon a similar sum tomorrow	233.05299359306457
I will give a faithful account of the sum to your lordship said Planchet putting the bag under his arm	198.03385841336473
That is right I recommend the cardinal to your attention	167.28716321597875
Make your mind easy he is in good hands	92.69826943255376
Planchet went out the curate remaining for a moment	53.244179244393415
Are you satisfied my lord he asked	35.78512880587309
Yes he appears to be a resolute fellow	751.5306220585945
Well he will do more than he has promised	19.980807064310017
The curate rejoined Planchet who was waiting for him on the stairs	13.940326201173662
Ten minutes later the curate of St	28.283358503723353
As soon as the door of Gondys study was opened a man rushed in	79.27679852781102
It was the Count de Rochefort	1931.284987397228
Tis you then my dear count cried Gondy offering his hand	135.149990604387
You have made up your mind at last my lord said Rochefort	115.93707482151771
It has been made up a long time said Gondy	121.64977518265735
Let us say no more on the subject you tell me so I believe you	26.80822627928702
Well we are going to give a ball to Mazarin	190.8540225169327
And when will the dance begin	9779.117205939772
The invitations are given for this evening said the coadjutor but the violins will not begin to play until tomorrow morning	104.14251579151023
You may reckon upon me and upon fifty soldiers which the Chevalier dHumieres has promised me whenever I need them	274.3945541724239
Yes he is making recruits and he will lend them to me if any are missing when the fete is over I shall replace them	172.15099415337517
Good my dear Rochefort but that is not all	37.91857601896522
What have you done with Monsieur de Beaufort	114.86632370043917
He is in Vendome where he will wait until I write to him to return to Paris	45.125601769297816
Write to him nows the time	116.32174949281512
You are sure of your enterprise	49166.23090776058
Yes but he must make haste for hardly will the people of Paris have revolted before we shall have a score of princes begging to lead them	349.4787430041896
If he defers he will find the place of honor taken	176.9616466133546
Shall I send word to him as coming from you	105.3462858101542
Shall I tell him that he can count on you	101.84019656047668
And you will leave the command to him	83.35867518341422
Of the war yes but in politics	403.41840565514593
You must know it is not his element	323.4989489677945
He must leave me to negotiate for my cardinals hat in my own fashion	380.7779397235318
You care about it then so much	32.711542579030365
Since they force me to wear a hat of a form which does not become me said Gondy I wish at least that the hat should be red	160.5814457366801
One must not dispute matters of taste and colors said Rochefort laughing	739.0796317675074
How soon can he be here	122.47607289015696
Let him come and he will find a change I will answer for it	55.56840522987042
Therefore go and collect your fifty men and hold yourself in readiness	283.2188926630165
Is there any signal for the general rally	1096.7208374219476
A knot of straw in the hat	40.39800078541119
Ah Monsieur Mazarin Monsieur Mazarin said Rochefort leading off his curate who had not found an opportunity of uttering a single word during the foregoing dialogue you will see whether I am too old to be a man of action	105.40933527401306
It was halfpast nine oclock and the coadjutor required half an hour to go from the archbishops palace to the tower of St	117.93772615711761
He remarked that a light was burning in one of the highest windows of the tower	46.884116651762376
Good said he our syndic is at his post	38.00862211200842
He knocked and the door was opened	8.25187193150919
The vicar himself awaited him conducted him to the top of the tower and when there pointed to a little door placed the light which he had brought with him in a corner of the wall that the coadjutor might be able to find it on his return and went down again	42.75056279019333
Although the key was in the door the coadjutor knocked	192.91670314506916
Come in said a voice which he recognized as that of the mendicant whom he found lying on a kind of truckle bed	135.02034365178315
He rose on the entrance of the coadjutor and at that moment ten oclock struck	47.65373784479828
Well said Gondy have you kept your word with me	45.467728972614616
You asked me for five hundred men did you not Well I have ten thousand for you	56.693107445391966
Do you wish for a proof	99.59580000900917
There were three candles alight each of which burnt before a window one looking upon the city the other upon the Palais Royal and a third upon the Rue Saint Denis	146.53820377586194
The man went silently to each of the candles and blew them out one after the other	101.6915375570548
What are you doing asked the coadjutor	252.29980217393828
When you leave this you will behold my men at work	481.7125566161984
Only take care you do not break your legs in stumbling over some chain or your neck by falling in a hole	279.19133751339456
Good there is your money the same sum as that you have received already	95.51144814961388
Now remember that you are a general and do not go and drink	67.23523728643903
For twenty years I have tasted nothing but water	1472.6011690201851
The man took the bag from the hands of the coadjutor who heard the sound of his fingers counting and handling the gold pieces	58.43916957894752
Ah ah said the coadjutor you are avaricious my good fellow	81.76660705244277
The mendicant sighed and threw down the bag	41.496203921477544
Must I always be the same said he and shall I never succeed in overcoming the old leaven Oh misery oh vanity	416.50813269028987
Yes but I make hereby a vow in your presence to employ all that remains to me in pious works	195.95686228049667
His face was pale and drawn like that of a man who had just undergone some inward struggle	134.01997682106463
Singular man muttered Gondy taking his hat to go away but on turning around he saw the beggar between him and the door	108.64323812739545
His first idea was that this man intended to do him some harm but on the contrary he saw him fall on his knees before him with his hands clasped	26.605704635884916
Your blessing your holiness before you go I beseech you he cried	62.3671816551188
Your holiness said Gondy my friend you take me for some one else	37.06252593084599
No your holiness I take you for what you are that is to say the coadjutor I recognized you at the first glance	50.384215074563286
And you want my blessing he said	17.4790347280943
Yes I have need of it	6.960198250594205
The mendicant uttered these words in a tone of such humility such earnest repentance that Gondy placed his hand upon him and gave him his benediction with all the unction of which he was capable	106.52822784365374
Now said Gondy there is a communion between us	191.27955928841374
I have blessed you and you are sacred to me	38.79858954233004
Come have you committed some crime pursued by human justice from which I can protect you	123.24781640339114
The crime which I have committed my lord has no call upon human justice and you can only deliver me from it by blessing me frequently as you have just done	126.64283977760076
Come be candid said the coadjutor you have not all your life followed the trade which you do now	120.07263221269336
I have pursued it for six years only	306.84027637614435
And before you went to the Bastile	178.72262157925806
I will tell you my lord on the day when you are willing to hear my confession	50.23515750182364
Good At whatsoever hour of the day or night you may present yourself remember that I shall be ready to give you absolution	64.35202599420407
Thank you my lord said the mendicant in a hoarse voice	22.041620399456896
But I am not yet ready to receive it	122.36196644419162
Adieu your holiness said the mendicant opening the door and bending low before the prelate	274.4766313368143
It was about eleven oclock at night	30.349905320225012
Gondy had not walked a hundred steps ere he perceived the strange change which had been made in the streets of Paris	57.42259986972438
The whole city seemed peopled with fantastic beings silent shadows were seen unpaving the streets and others dragging and upsetting great wagons whilst others again dug ditches large enough to ingulf whole regiments of horsemen	2251.7018671431447
These active beings flitted here and there like so many demons completing some unknown labor these were the beggars of the Court of Miraclesthe agents of the giver of holy water in the Square of Saint Eustache preparing barricades for the morrow	359.531738453853
Gondy gazed on these deeds of darkness on these nocturnal laborers with a kind of fear he asked himself if after having called forth these foul creatures from their dens he should have the power of making them retire again	180.7100030382513
He felt almost inclined to cross himself when one of these beings happened to approach him	135.62838568515804
He reached the Rue Saint Honore and went up it toward the Rue de la Ferronnerie there the aspect changed here it was the tradesmen who were running from shop to shop their doors seemed closed like their shutters but they were only pushed to in such a manner as to open and allow the men who seemed fearful of showing what they carried to enter closing immediately	160.86781844930334
These men were shopkeepers who had arms to lend to those who had none	88.27987353153964
One individual went from door to door bending under the weight of swords guns muskets and every kind of weapon which he deposited as fast as he could	128.94305569846037
By the light of a lantern the coadjutor recognized Planchet	1976.4655571265291
The coadjutor proceeded onward to the quay by way of the Rue de la Monnaie there he found groups of bourgeois clad in black cloaks or gray according as they belonged to the upper or lower bourgeoisie	198.22029943329903
They were standing motionless while single men passed from one group to another	514.0436119454702
All these cloaks gray or black were raised behind by the point of a sword or before by the barrel of an arquebuse or a musket	111.28599785209938
On reaching the Pont Neuf the coadjutor found it strictly guarded and a man approached him	375.10219858698235
Who are you asked the man	29.253311325020857
I do not know you for one of us	27.886550746920598
Then it is because you do not know your friends my dear Monsieur Louvieres said the coadjutor raising his hat	59.841762242902625
Gondy continued his way and went as far as the Tour de Nesle	174.73116739964692
There he saw a lengthy chain of people gliding under the walls	320.5701175145554
They might be said to be a procession of ghosts for they were all wrapped in white cloaks	206.56502324511933
When they reached a certain spot these men appeared to be annihilated one after the other as if the earth had opened under their feet	171.22577502552957
Gondy edged into a corner saw them vanish from the first until the last but one	160.0293345090539
The last raised his eyes to ascertain doubtless that neither his companions nor himself had been watched and in spite of the darkness he perceived Gondy	170.3795946049811
He walked straight up to him and placed a pistol to his throat	40.51817971755397
Halloo Monsieur de Rochefort said Gondy laughing are you a boy to play with firearms	658.0438335277732
Ah it is you my lord said he	22.93702958847699
What people are you leading thus into the bowels of the earth	136.11058027915774
My fifty recruits from the Chevalier dHumieres who are destined to enter the light cavalry and who have only received as yet for their equipment their white cloaks	360.0133339655229
To the house of one of my friends a sculptor only we enter by the trap through which he lets down his marble	149.5466425126939
Very good said Gondy shaking Rochefort by the hand who descended in his turn and closed the trap after him	114.27448320678828
It was now one oclock in the morning and the coadjutor returned home	30.79600083291087
He opened a window and leaned out to listen	144.73012494871526
A strange incomprehensible unearthly sound seemed to pervade the whole city one felt that something unusual and terrible was happening in all the streets now dark as oceans most unfathomable caves	567.9648914423403
From time to time a dull sound was heard like that of a rising tempest or a billow of the sea but nothing clear nothing distinct nothing intelligible it was like those mysterious subterraneous noises that precede an earthquake	365.7635708199173
The work of revolt continued the whole night thus	248.05202351379938
The next morning on awaking Paris seemed to be startled at her own appearance	87.17186818347162
It was like a besieged town	4274.808622266271
Armed men shouldering muskets watched over the barricades with menacing looks words of command patrols arrests executions even were encountered at every step	951.437295810902
Those bearing plumed hats and gold swords were stopped and made to cry Long live Broussel Down with Mazarin and whoever refused to comply with this ceremony was hooted at spat upon and even beaten	351.3768205156749
They had not yet begun to slay but it was well felt that the inclination to do so was not wanting	119.13763486997809
The barricades had been pushed as far as the Palais Royal	64.27125477433529
From the Rue de Bons Enfants to that of the Ferronnerie from the Rue Saint ThomasduLouvre to the Pont Neuf from the Rue Richelieu to the Porte Saint Honore there were more than ten thousand armed men those who were at the front hurled defiance at the impassive sentinels of the regiment of guards posted around the Palais Royal the gates of which were closed behind them a precaution which made their situation precarious	198.61143868318354
Among these thousands moved in bands numbering from one hundred to two hundred pale and haggard men clothed in rags who bore a sort of standard on which was inscribed these words Behold the misery of the people Wherever these men passed frenzied cries were heard and there were so many of these bands that the cries were to be heard in all directions	284.15351722301494
The astonishment of Mazarin and of Anne of Austria was great when it was announced to them that the city which the previous evening they had left entirely tranquil had awakened to such feverish commotion nor would either the one or the other believe the reports that were brought to them declaring they would rather rely on the evidence of their own eyes and ears	140.39992870637633
Then a window was opened and when they saw and heard they were convinced	61.199185130914415
Mazarin shrugged his shoulders and pretended to despise the populace but he turned visibly pale and ran to his closet trembling all over locked up his gold and jewels in his caskets and put his finest diamonds on his fingers	157.84401811311182
As for the queen furious and left to her own guidance she went for the Marechal de la Meilleraie and desired him to take as many men as he pleased and to go and see what was the meaning of this pleasantry	82.96320713755479
The marshal was ordinarily very adventurous and was wo nt to hesitate at nothing and he had that lofty contempt for the populace which army officers usually profess	430.53093794215107
He took a hundred and fifty men and attempted to go out by the Pont du Louvre but there he met Rochefort and his fifty horsemen attended by more than five hundred men	152.23010555244767
The marshal made no attempt to force that barrier and returned up the quay	233.1305177661395
But at Pont Neuf he found Louvieres and his bourgeois	1256.368327473518
This time the marshal charged but he was welcomed by musket shots while stones fell like hail from all the windows	315.09684760357084
He beat a retreat toward the market but there he met Planchet with his halberdiers their halberds were leveled at him threateningly	633.8141210830395
He attempted to ride over those gray cloaks but the gray cloaks held their ground and the marshal retired toward the Rue Saint Honore leaving four of his guards dead on the field of battle	214.58083127665944
The marshal then entered the Rue Saint Honore but there he was opposed by the barricades of the mendicant of Saint Eustache	102.54127987819719
They were guarded not only by armed men but even by women and children	201.56736186034115
Master Friquet the owner of a pistol and of a sword which Louvieres had given him had organized a company of rogues like himself and was making a tremendous racket	273.0012022851268
The marshal thought this barrier not so well fortified as the others and determined to break through it	176.6311070249969
He dismounted twenty men to make a breach in the barricade whilst he and others remaining on their horses were to protect the assailants	404.34727199448116
The twenty men marched straight toward the barrier but from behind the beams from among the wagonwheels and from the heights of the rocks a terrible fusillade burst forth and at the same time Planchets halberdiers appeared at the corner of the Cemetery of the Innocents and Louvieress bourgeois at the corner of the Rue de la Monnaie	124.88099011587528
The Marechal de la Meilleraie was caught between two fires but he was brave and made up his mind to die where he was	83.08298972783207
He returned blow for blow and cries of pain began to be heard in the crowd	51.9581567201275
The guards more skillful did greater execution but the bourgeois more numerous overwhelmed them with a veritable hurricane of iron	710.5825933606918
Men fell around him as they had fallen at Rocroy or at Lerida	426.86326873616656
Fontrailles his aidedecamp had an arm broken his horse had received a bullet in his neck and he had difficulty in controlling him maddened by pain	311.8839923121409
In short he had reached that supreme moment when the bravest feel a shudder in their veins when suddenly in the direction of the Rue de lArbreSec the crowd opened crying Long live the coadjutor and Gondy in surplice and cloak appeared moving tranquilly in the midst of the fusillade and bestowing his benedictions to the right and left as undisturbed as if he were leading a procession of the Fete Dieu	219.1941488593791
The marshal recognized him and hastened to meet him	16.77665293261115
Get me out of this in Heavens name he said or I shall leave my carcass here and those of all my men	131.38021633684383
A great tumult arose in the midst of which even the noise of thunder could not have been heard	28.896326590435795
Gondy raised his hand and demanded silence	19812.724964122175
My children he said this is the Marechal de la Meilleraie as to whose intentions you have been deceived and who pledges himself on returning to the Louvre to demand of the queen in your name our Broussels release	158.01892172099048
You pledge yourself to that marshal added Gondy turning to La Meilleraie	2393.829250976426
Morbleu cried the latter I should say that I do pledge myself to it I had no hope of getting off so easily	81.17503883106133
He gives you his word of honor said Gondy	104.87784878772396
The marshal raised his hand in token of assent	14.899045922651739
Long live the coadjutor cried the crowd	52.30338605638383
Some voices even added Long live the marshal But all took up the cry in chorus Down with Mazarin	270.4482601596355
The crowd gave place the barricade was opened and the marshal with the remnant of his company retreated preceded by Friquet and his bandits some of them making a presence of beating drums and others imitating the sound of the trumpet	337.8524011251961
It was almost a triumphal procession only behind the guards the barricades were closed again	413.065896043802
In the meantime as we have said Mazarin was in his closet putting his affairs in order	145.99764241439638
He called for DArtagnan but in the midst of such tumult he little expected to see him DArtagnan not being on service	208.9122352099499
In about ten minutes DArtagnan appeared at the door followed by the inseparable Porthos	64.95720131590376
Ah come in come in Monsieur dArtagnan cried the cardinal and welcome your friend too	476.8913432084837
But what is going on in this accursed Paris	263.857528624699
What is going on my lord nothing good replied DArtagnan shaking his head	222.29985063914307
The town is in open revolt and just now as I was crossing the Rue Montorgueil with Monsieur du Vallon who is here and is your humble servant they wanted in spite of my uniform or perhaps because of my uniform to make us cry Long live Broussel and must I tell you my lord what they wished us to cry as well	122.11957262131862
Down with Mazarin Ifaith the treasonable word is out	2673.2164854707585
Mazarin smiled but became very pale	3.6371001073500886
And you did cry he asked	53.91314392132853
Ifaith no said DArtagnan I was not in voice Monsieur du Vallon has a cold and did not cry either	178.08510365460404
Look at my hat and cloak	2238.07685795012
And DArtagnan displayed four gunshot holes in his cloak and two in his beaver	181.6523966329251
As for Porthoss coat a blow from a halberd had cut it open on the flank and a pistol shot had cut his feather in two	220.68226614908951
Diavolo said the cardinal pensively gazing at the two friends with lively admiration I should have cried I should	120.47923265374739
At this moment the tumult was heard nearer	52.367160620699096
Mazarin wiped his forehead and looked around him	14.983548166475513
He had a great desire to go to the window but he dared not	23.902954674498993
See what is going on Monsieur DArtagnan said he	288.8050102090797
DArtagnan went to the window with his habitual composure	153.8990188634878
Oho said he what is this Marechal de la Meilleraie returning without a hatFontrailles with his arm in a slingwounded guardshorses bleeding eh then what are the sentinels about They are aimingthey are going to fire	628.1605629744314
They have received orders to fire on the people if the people approach the Palais Royal exclaimed Mazarin	319.6268103437767
But if they fire all is lost cried DArtagnan	298.22026147933997
The gates to hold for five minutesthe gates they will be torn down twisted into iron wire ground to powder Gods death do nt fire screamed DArtagnan throwing open the window	806.791948683971
In spite of this recommendation which owing to the noise could scarcely have been heard two or three musket shots resounded succeeded by a terrible discharge	200.76608873795158
The balls might be heard peppering the facade of the Palais Royal and one of them passing under DArtagnans arm entered and broke a mirror in which Porthos was complacently admiring himself	345.3549049195303
Alack alack cried the cardinal a Venetian glass	792.734713955115
Oh my lord said DArtagnan quietly shutting the window it is not worth while weeping yet for probably an hour hence there will not be one of your mirrors remaining in the Palais Royal whether they be Venetian or Parisian	258.9315651905371
But what do you advise then asked Mazarin trembling	720.6057600542158
Eh egad to give up Broussel as they demand What the devil do you want with a member of the parliament He is of no earthly use to anybody	214.7737143756749
And you Monsieur du Vallon is that your advice What would you do	73.30046219802266
I should give up Broussel said Porthos	193.08963413899536
Come come with me gentlemen exclaimed Mazarin	675.0073227636442
I will go and discuss the matter with the queen	109.54295623785883
He stopped at the end of the corridor and said	19.47374204800087
I can count upon you gentlemen can I not	156.0631576802588
We do not give ourselves twice over said DArtagnan we have given ourselves to you command we shall obey	229.22498309177294
Very well then said Mazarin enter this cabinet and wait till I come back	169.785071576202
And turning off he entered the drawingroom by another door	94.70304960471854
The closet into which DArtagnan and Porthos had been ushered was separated from the drawingroom where the queen was by tapestried curtains only and this thin partition enabled them to hear all that passed in the adjoining room whilst the aperture between the two hangings small as it was permitted them to see	165.74311927164266
The queen was standing in the room pale with anger her selfcontrol however was so great that it might have been imagined that she was calm	67.924346731354
Comminges Villequier and Guitant were behind her and the women again were behind the men	188.45256185198932
The Chancellor Sequier who twenty years previously had persecuted her so ruthlessly stood before her relating how his carriage had been smashed how he had been pursued and had rushed into the Hotel dO that the hotel was immediately invaded pillaged and devastated happily he had time to reach a closet hidden behind tapestry in which he was secreted by an old woman together with his brother the Bishop of Meaux	295.6794912442485
Then the danger was so imminent the rioters came so near uttering such threats that the chancellor thought his last hour had come and confessed himself to his brother priest so as to be all ready to die in case he was discovered	229.15690832885855
Fortunately however he had not been taken the people believing that he had escaped by some back entrance retired and left him at liberty to retreat	125.59407245804888
Then disguised in the clothes of the Marquis dO he had left the hotel stumbling over the bodies of an officer and two guards who had been killed whilst defending the street door	196.14023822689893
During the recital Mazarin entered and glided noiselessly up to the queen to listen	165.26057015486808
Well said the queen when the chancellor had finished speaking what do you think of it all	78.52727230391396
I think that matters look very gloomy madame	358.0098135234981
But what step would you propose to me	50.69035382221359
I could propose one to your majesty but I dare not	33.19264371873433
You may you may sir said the queen with a bitter smile you were not so timid once	47.58350052889778
The chancellor reddened and stammered some words	242.9438908696972
It is not a question of the past but of the present said the queen you said you could give me advicewhat is it	97.54267693752207
Madame said the chancellor hesitating it would be to release Broussel	355.20363469812133
The queen although already pale became visibly paler and her face was contracted	136.6755603903187
At this moment steps were heard in the anteroom and without any announcement the Marechal de la Meilleraie appeared at the door	60.43953167387108
Ah there you are marechal cried Anne of Austria joyfully	141.5337094572192
I trust you have brought this rabble to reason	1084.6663840679685
Madame replied the marechal I have left three men on the Pont Neuf four at the Halle six at the corner of the Rue de lArbreSec and two at the door of your palacefifteen in all	97.42225187094432
I have brought away ten or twelve wounded	79.08502442273266
I know not where I have left my hat and in all probability I should have been left with my hat had the coadjutor not arrived in time to rescue me	63.692980882307786
Ah indeed said the queen it would have much astonished me if that low cur with his distorted legs had not been mixed up with all this	141.8857592185302
Madame said La Meilleraie do not say too much against him before me for the service he rendered me is still fresh	80.1111287710977
Very good said the queen be as grateful as you like it does not implicate me you are here safe and sound that is all I wished for you are not only welcome but welcome back	88.46554608983075
Yes madame but I only came back on one conditionthat I would transmit to your majesty the will of the people	147.9939643308932
The will exclaimed the queen frowning	18693.583070663248
Oh oh monsieur marechal you must indeed have found yourself in wondrous peril to have undertaken so strange a commission	265.7216142464962
The irony with which these words were uttered did not escape the marechal	174.30976926388013
Pardon madame he said I am not a lawyer I am a mere soldier and probably therefore I do not quite comprehend the value of certain words I ought to have said the wishes and not the will of the people	85.72524624706855
As for what you do me the honor to say I presume you mean I was afraid	48.31647882304126
Well then madame yes I did feel fear and though I have been through twelve pitched battles and I can not count how many charges and skirmishes I own for the third time in my life I was afraid	172.01159972146885
Yes and I would rather face your majesty however threatening your smile than face those demons who accompanied me hither and who sprung from I know not whence unless from deepest hell	865.0815771109047
Bravo said DArtagnan in a whisper to Porthos well answered	735.9122861581028
Well said the queen biting her lips whilst her courtiers looked at each other with surprise what is the desire of my people	63.54450124035136
That Broussel shall be given up to them madame	108.29996960714489
Your majesty is mistress said La Meilleraie retreating a few steps	276.78684654760605
Where are you going marechal asked the queen	38.74688830013192
To give your majestys reply to those who await it	68.31083085785369
Stay marechal I will not appear to parley with rebels	1147.9010109476058
Madame I have pledged my word and unless you order me to be arrested I shall be forced to return	50.829613471361434
Anne of Austrias eyes shot glances of fire	282.8849712890985
Oh that is no impediment sir said she I have had greater men than you arrestedGuitant	295.22001265533726
Madame said he if I dared in my turn advise	885.4573134925056
Would it be to give up Broussel sir If so you can spare yourself the trouble	236.82575968525444
No said Mazarin although perhaps that counsel is as good as any other	73.6846817035548
To call for monsieur le coadjuteur	594.6297698246156
The coadjutor cried the queen that dreadful mischief maker It is he who has raised all this revolt	387.7835827869091
The more reason said Mazarin if he has raised it he can put it down	57.29177644656517
And hold madame suggested Comminges who was near a window out of which he could see hold the moment is a happy one for there he is now giving his blessing in the square of the Palais Royal	111.10585381426336
The queen sprang to the window	29.735953598900682
It is true she said the arch hypocritesee	13187.77687752608
I see said Mazarin that everybody kneels before him although he be but coadjutor whilst I were I in his place though I am cardinal should be torn to pieces	513.4556581251891
I persist then madame in my wish he laid an emphasis on the word that your majesty should receive the coadjutor	134.85256881180615
And wherefore do you not say like the rest your will replied the queen in a low voice	59.22942563159225
Monsieur le marechal said the queen after a moments reflection go and find the coadjutor and bring him to me	83.15197594054163
And what shall I say to the people	34.19165292207771
That they must have patience said Anne as I have	69.27596697593235
The fiery Spanish woman spoke in a tone so imperative that the marechal made no reply he bowed and went out	62.594479906080544
How will this end he said	4.92855481929111
We shall soon see said Porthos in his tranquil way	369.5009074733766
In the meantime Anne of Austria approached Comminges and conversed with him in a subdued tone whilst Mazarin glanced uneasily at the corner occupied by DArtagnan and Porthos	257.6922806283563
Ere long the door opened and the marechal entered followed by the coadjutor	77.03279558782613
There madame he said is Monsieur Gondy who hastens to obey your majestys summons	1063.7399850373783
The queen advanced a few steps to meet him and then stopped cold severe unmoved with her lower lip scornfully protruded	421.859253822494
Well sir said the queen what is your opinion of this riot	88.37399064963668
That it is no longer a riot madame he replied but a revolt	743.3156529567095
The revolt is at the door of those who think my people can rebel cried Anne unable to dissimulate before the coadjutor whom she looked upon and probably with reason as the promoter of the tumult	228.1664496905542
Revolt thus it is called by those who have wished for this demonstration and who are perhaps the cause of it but wait wait the kings authority will put all this to rights	184.26820240076765
Was it to tell me that madame coldly replied Gondy that your majesty admitted me to the honor of entering your presence	195.77274821769538
No my dear coadjutor said Mazarin it was to ask your advice in the unhappy dilemma in which we find ourselves	126.58381815689778
Is it true asked Gondy feigning astonishment that her majesty summoned me to ask for my opinion	277.69589554586787
Yes said the queen it is requested	109.96413582787345
You to say what you would do in her place Mazarin hastened to reply	229.7429879079057
The coadjutor looked at the queen who replied by a sign in the affirmative	61.981998052694735
Were I in her majestys place said Gondy coldly I should not hesitate I should release Broussel	410.3834268181165
And if I do not give him up what think you will be the result exclaimed the queen	88.82836037469552
I believe that not a stone in Paris will remain unturned put in the marechal	601.985316708127
It was not your opinion that I asked said the queen sharply without even turning around	199.66468141803446
If it is I whom your majesty interrogates replied the coadjutor in the same calm manner I reply that I hold monsieur le marechals opinion in every respect	285.7954618573841
The color mounted to the queens face her fine blue eyes seemed to start out of her head and her carmine lips compared by all the poets of the day to a pomegranate in flower were trembling with anger	161.8429897908614
Mazarin himself who was well accustomed to the domestic outbreaks of this disturbed household was alarmed	214.63216595240232
Give up Broussel she cried fine counsel indeed	9155.119995265875
Upon my word one can easily see it comes from a priest	81.49180061655024
Gondy remained firm and the abuse of the day seemed to glide over his head as the sarcasms of the evening before had done but hatred and revenge were accumulating in his heart silently and drop by drop	182.163345659941
He looked coldly at the queen who nudged Mazarin to make him say something in his turn	176.93791228303303
Mazarin according to his custom was thinking much and saying little	1120.9314126334618
Ho ho said he good advice advice of a friend	67.7593370785815
I too would give up that good Monsieur Broussel dead or alive and all would be at an end	159.15864138118312
If you yield him dead all will indeed be at an end my lord but quite otherwise than you mean	150.1883070135818
Did I say dead or alive replied Mazarin	911.1604812524382
It was only a way of speaking	46.61918988086923
You know I am not familiar with the French language which you monsieur le coadjuteur both speak and write so well	228.5663378877784
This is a council of state DArtagnan remarked to Porthos but we held better ones at La Rochelle with Athos and Aramis	741.856267371272
At the Saint Gervais bastion said Porthos	1486.058510320357
The coadjutor let the storm pass over his head and resumed still with the same tranquillity	66.27248389666812
Madame if the opinion I have submitted to you does not please you it is doubtless because you have better counsels to follow	142.08025391173794
I know too well the wisdom of the queen and that of her advisers to suppose that they will leave the capital long in trouble that may lead to a revolution	152.18089970493975
Thus then it is your opinion said Anne of Austria with a sneer and biting her lips with rage that yesterdays riot which today is already a rebellion tomorrow may become a revolution	170.6066806462541
Yes madame replied the coadjutor gravely	3103.9685361121956
But if I am to believe you sir the people seem to have thrown off all restraint	127.58671767410719
It is a bad year for kings said Gondy shaking his head look at England madame	253.60799681743617
Yes but fortunately we have no Oliver Cromwell in France replied the queen	267.6900357171153
Who knows said Gondy such men are like thunderboltsone recognizes them only when they have struck	350.1781726871647
Every one shuddered and there was a moment of silence during which the queen pressed her hand to her side evidently to still the beatings of her heart	74.0564095540034
Porthos murmured DArtagnan look well at that priest	285.55316920174687
Yes said Porthos I see him	16.5005442292358
Porthos looked at DArtagnan in astonishment	229.89365331523584
Evidently he did not understand his meaning	80.70492820356853
Your majesty continued the coadjutor pitilessly is about to take such measures as seem good to you but I foresee that they will be violent and such as will still further exasperate the rioters	400.4475011655596
In that case you monsieur le coadjuteur who have such power over them and are at the same time friendly to us said the queen ironically will quiet them by bestowing your blessing upon them	191.99843053875045
Perhaps it will be too late said Gondy still unmoved perhaps I shall have lost all influence while by giving up Broussel your majesty will strike at the root of the sedition and will gain the right to punish severely any revival of the revolt	255.99091089668937
Have I not then that right cried the queen	388.43133887230914
If you have it use it replied Gondy	998.3952384408127
There is a man after my own heart	52.47313058930841
Oh if he were minister and I were his DArtagnan instead of belonging to that beast of a Mazarin mordieu what fine things we would do together	442.0932965654987
The queen made a sign for every one except Mazarin to quit the room and Gondy bowed as if to leave with the rest	130.54209533482668
Stay sir said Anne to him	22.280765316895323
Good thought Gondy she is going to yield	38.59380987071461
She is going to have him killed said DArtagnan to Porthos but at all events it shall not be by me	119.02722579842771
I swear to Heaven on the contrary that if they fall upon him I will fall upon them	53.27192086790732
Good muttered Mazarin sitting down we shall soon see something startling	230.93015531397387
The queens eyes followed the retreating figures and when the last had closed the door she turned away	83.3933668005173
It was evident that she was making unnatural efforts to subdue her anger she fanned herself smelled at her vinaigrette and walked up and down	371.5103479692259
Gondy who began to feel uneasy examined the tapestry with his eyes touched the coat of mail which he wore under his long gown and felt from time to time to see if the handle of a good Spanish dagger which was hidden under his cloak was well within reach	89.45632125749758
And now at last said the queen now that we are alone repeat your counsel monsieur le coadjuteur	278.3967198409346
It is this madame that you should appear to have reflected and publicly acknowledge an error which constitutes the extra strength of a strong government release Broussel from prison and give him back to the people	277.9703696019697
Oh cried Anne to humble myself thus Am I or am I not the queen This screaming mob are they or are they not my subjects Have I friends Have I guards Ah by Notre Dame as Queen Catherine used to say continued she excited by her own words rather than give up this infamous Broussel to them I will strangle him with my own hands	408.88452500484215
And she sprang toward Gondy whom assuredly at that moment she hated more than Broussel with outstretched arms	512.5832452489806
The coadjutor remained immovable and not a muscle of his face was discomposed only his glance flashed like a sword in returning the furious looks of the queen	261.70431697901705
He were a dead man said the Gascon if there were still a Vitry at the court and if Vitry entered at this moment but for my part before he could reach the good prelate I would kill Vitry at once the cardinal would be infinitely pleased with me	177.37136019507636
Madame cried the cardinal seizing hold of Anne and drawing her back Madame what are you about	210.62702895977023
Then he added in Spanish Anne are you mad You a queen to quarrel like a washerwoman And do you not perceive that in the person of this priest is represented the whole people of Paris and that it is dangerous to insult him at this moment and if this priest wished it in an hour you would be without a crown Come then on another occasion you can be firm and strong but today is not the proper time today flatter and caress or you are only a common woman	161.50922169933324
At the first words of this address DArtagnan had seized Porthoss arm which he pressed with gradually increasing force	580.4365088073861
When Mazarin ceased speaking he said to Porthos in a low tone	24.157117710019833
Never tell Mazarin that I understand Spanish or I am a lost man and you are also	90.47507889270959
This rough appeal marked by the eloquence which characterized Mazarin when he spoke in Italian or Spanish and which he lost entirely in speaking French was uttered with such impenetrable expression that Gondy clever physiognomist as he was had no suspicion of its being more than a simple warning to be more subdued	234.14472734193936
The queen on her part thus chided softened immediately and sat down and in an almost weeping voice letting her arms fall by her side said	267.9220905221064
Pardon me sir and attribute this violence to what I suffer	192.49622108870892
A woman and consequently subject to the weaknesses of my sex I am alarmed at the idea of civil war a queen accustomed to be obeyed I am excited at the first opposition	97.10638000110545
Madame replied Gondy bowing your majesty is mistaken in qualifying my sincere advice as opposition	745.7464954849976
Your majesty has none but submissive and respectful subjects	4266.191372666651
It is not the queen with whom the people are displeased they ask for Broussel and are only too happy if you release him to them to live under your government	143.7416659388565
Mazarin who at the words It is not the queen with whom the people are displeased had pricked up his ears thinking that the coadjutor was about to speak of the cries Down with Mazarin and pleased with Gondys suppression of this fact he said with his sweetest voice and his most gracious expression	125.42545166441879
Madame credit the coadjutor who is one of the most able politicians we have the first available cardinals hat seems to belong already to his noble brow	487.469500116532
Ah how much you have need of me cunning rogue thought Gondy	1836.9078664180765
And what will he promise us said DArtagnan	228.09557908375277
Peste if he is giving away hats like that Porthos let us look out and both demand a regiment tomorrow	717.0523914532178
Corbleu let the civil war last but one year and I will have a constables sword gilt for me	399.44093830627816
And for me put in Porthos	97105.83522088178
For you I will give you the baton of the Marechal de la Meilleraie who does not seem to be much in favor just now	79.61701376443534
And so sir said the queen you are seriously afraid of a public tumult	209.5683746533825
Seriously said Gondy astonished at not having further advanced I fear that when the torrent has broken its embankment it will cause fearful destruction	616.7267556477235
And I said the queen think that in such a case other embankments should be raised to oppose it	168.0982401763297
Gondy looked at Mazarin astonished and Mazarin approached the queen to speak to her but at this moment a frightful tumult arose from the square of the Palais Royal	76.11665238691657
Gondy smiled the queens color rose and Mazarin grew even paler	813.6227445486536
What is that again he asked	7.513960824418149
At this moment Comminges rushed into the room	5.294996048486399
Pardon your majesty he cried but the people have dashed the sentinels against the gates and they are now forcing the doors what are your commands	204.4350215427774
The moaning of waves the noise of thunder the roaring of a volcano can not be compared with the tempest of cries heard at that moment	97.73046291073084
What are my commands said the queen	88.09707496227463
How many men have you about the Palais Royal	354.72852967065273
Place a hundred around the king and with the remainder sweep away this mob for me	493.0339517619441
Madame cried Mazarin what are you about	18.26927813664967
Comminges went out with a soldiers passive obedience	23835.692898938654
At this moment a monstrous battering was heard	491.3765748519211
One of the gates began to yield	25.785914628859356
Oh madame cried Mazarin you have ruined us allthe king yourself and me	508.8344506211507
At this cry from the soul of the frightened cardinal Anne became alarmed in her turn and would have recalled Comminges	315.5666038857449
It is too late said Mazarin tearing his hair too late	273.3999109596445
Hoarse shouts were heard from the excited mob	1552.0779451341048
DArtagnan put his hand to his sword motioning to Porthos to follow his example	164.24864284620915
Save the queen cried Mazarin to the coadjutor	88.0332529952153
Gondy sprang to the window and threw it open he recognized Louvieres at the head of a troop of about three or four thousand men	61.41190085527271
Not a step further he shouted the queen is signing	1642.115995871646
What are you saying asked the queen	100.75418848762014
The truth madame said Mazarin placing a pen and a paper before her you must then he added Sign Anne I implore youI command you	628.9799002483345
The queen fell into a chair took the pen and signed	34.84576304958048
The people kept back by Louvieres had not made another step forward but the awful murmuring which indicates an angry people continued	552.3392321997114
The queen had written The keeper of the prison at Saint Germain will set Councillor Broussel at liberty and she had signed it	278.12399417646014
The coadjutor whose eyes devoured her slightest movements seized the paper immediately the signature had been affixed to it returned to the window and waved it in his hand	142.51391233193144
This is the order he said	8.558910419998565
All Paris seemed to shout with joy and then the air resounded with the cries of Long live Broussel Long live the coadjutor	87.17913785712916
Long live the queen cried De Gondy but the cries which replied to his were poor and few and perhaps he had but uttered it to make Anne of Austria sensible of her weakness	260.3406629167237
And now that you have obtained what you want go said she Monsieur de Gondy	237.62174288615032
Whenever her majesty has need of me replied the coadjutor bowing her majesty knows I am at her command	152.7953764875963
Ah cursed priest cried Anne when he had retired stretching out her arm to the scarcely closed door one day I will make you drink the dregs of the atrocious gall you have poured out on me today	174.42539466337578
Leave me she exclaimed you are not a man and she went out of the room	19.693061277832573
It is you who are not a woman muttered Mazarin	299.24517988782753
Then after a moment of reverie he remembered where he had left DArtagnan and Porthos and that they must have overheard everything	161.42658528324728
He knit his brows and went direct to the tapestry which he pushed aside	120.33341100582271
At the queens last word DArtagnan had dragged Porthos into the gallery	505.1178914076436
Thither Mazarin went in his turn and found the two friends walking up and down	32.61583423014921
Why did you leave the closet Monsieur dArtagnan asked the cardinal	698.001693187942
Because replied DArtagnan the queen desired every one to leave and I thought that this command was intended for us as well as for the rest	63.69826986602957
And you have been here since	35.88789277772378
About a quarter of an hour said DArtagnan motioning to Porthos not to contradict him	231.86719177371165
Mazarin saw the sign and remained convinced that DArtagnan had seen and heard everything but he was pleased with his falsehood	127.63317395024897
Decidedly Monsieur dArtagnan you are the man I have been seeking	74.40177158458881
You may reckon upon me and so may your friend	187.54594532325999
Then bowing to the two musketeers with his most gracious smile he reentered his closet more calmly for on the departure of De Gondy the uproar had ceased as though by enchantment	250.44981256321572
Anne of Austria returned to her oratory furious	3139.768283075546
What she cried wringing her beautiful hands What the people have seen Monsieur de Cond a prince of the blood royal arrested by my motherinlaw Maria de Medicis they saw my motherinlaw their former regent expelled by the cardinal they saw Monsieur de Vendome that is to say the son of Henry IV	240.37906415192836
a prisoner at Vincennes and whilst these great personages were imprisoned insulted and threatened they said nothing and now for a Brousselgood God what then is to become of royalty	752.7815588090701
The queen unconsciously touched here upon the exciting question	425.96861281653855
The people had made no demonstration for the princes but they had risen for Broussel they were taking the part of a plebeian and in defending Broussel they instinctively felt they were defending themselves	299.23924798963515
During this time Mazarin walked up and down the study glancing from time to time at his beautiful Venetian mirror starred in every direction	166.86453454108735
Ah he said it is sad I know well to be forced to yield thus but pshaw we shall have our revenge	173.43153124708851
What matters it about Brousselit is a name not a thing	57.79435482873017
Mazarin clever politician as he was was for once mistaken Broussel was a thing not a name	270.53651067873903
The next morning therefore when Broussel made his entrance into Paris in a large carriage having his son Louvieres at his side and Friquet behind the vehicle the people threw themselves in his way and cries of Long live Broussel Long live our father resounded from all parts and was death to Mazarins ears and the cardinals spies brought bad news from every direction which greatly agitated the minister but was calmly received by the queen	220.05076836319904
The latter seemed to be maturing in her mind some great stroke a fact which increased the uneasiness of the cardinal who knew the proud princess and dreaded much the determination of Anne of Austria	199.23977572786274
The coadjutor returned to parliament more a monarch than king queen and cardinal all three together	1071.8602636659975
By his advice a decree from parliament summoned the citizens to lay down their arms and demolish the barricades	476.4444308925902
They now knew that it required but one hour to take up arms again and one night to reconstruct the barricades	267.21467118975545
Rochefort had returned to the Chevalier dHumieres his fifty horsemen less two missing at roll call	6170.516647040778
But the chevalier was himself at heart a Frondist and would hear nothing said of compensation	899.6959528641077
The mendicant had gone to his old place on the steps of Saint Eustache and was again distributing holy water with one hand and asking alms with the other	173.2680556092155
No one could suspect that those two hands had been engaged with others in drawing out from the social edifice the keystone of royalty	288.0842354237015
Louvieres was proud and satisfied he had taken revenge on Mazarin and had aided in his fathers deliverance from prison	376.54902759789155
His name had been mentioned as a name of terror at the Palais Royal	66.49266532171048
Laughingly he said to the councillor restored to his family	428.37653580815015
Do you think father that if now I should ask for a company the queen would give it to me	104.53030494603597
DArtagnan profited by this interval of calm to send away Raoul whom he had great difficulty in keeping shut up during the riot and who wished positively to strike a blow for one party or the other	282.9853385170263
Raoul had offered some opposition at first but DArtagnan made use of the Comte de la Feres name and after paying a visit to Madame de Chevreuse Raoul started to rejoin the army	132.51335982427327
Rochefort alone was dissatisfied with the termination of affairs	133.19065628599606
He had written to the Duc de Beaufort to come and the duke was about to arrive and he would find Paris tranquil	97.0569767104096
He went to the coadjutor to consult with him whether it would not be better to send word to the duke to stop on the road but Gondy reflected for a moment and then said	75.70329050646522
All is not then over asked Rochefort	9099.55132854565
My dear count we have only just begun	632.1697019138662
What induces you to think so	51.72438267783637
The knowledge that I have of the queens heart she will not rest contented beaten	607.2496873294011
Is she then preparing for a stroke	265.61377770289164
Come let us see what you know	21.305844369199995
I know that she has written to the prince to return in haste from the army	97.46302898357864
Ah ha said Rochefort you are right	7.610194140222091
We must let Monsieur de Beaufort come	475.2835536780159
In fact the evening after this conversation the report was circulated that the Prince de Cond had arrived	108.75797359291369
It was a very simple natural circumstance and yet it created a profound sensation	331.8585064767046
It was said that Madame de Longueville for whom the prince had more than a brothers affection and in whom he had confided had been indiscreet	115.24450924392963
His confidence had unveiled the sinister project of the queen	174.64633108197725
Even on the night of the princes return some citizens bolder than the rest such as the sheriffs captains and the quartermaster went from house to house among their friends saying	398.2146606810676
Why do we not take the king and place him in the Hotel de Ville It is a shame to leave him to be educated by our enemies who will give him evil counsel whereas brought up by the coadjutor for instance he would imbibe national principles and love his people	187.25544933834678
That night the question was secretly agitated and on the morrow the gray and black cloaks the patrols of armed shoppeople and the bands of mendicants reappeared	457.7068741731379
The queen had passed the night in lonely conference with the prince who had entered the oratory at midnight and did not leave till five oclock in the morning	64.36221573779869
At five oclock Anne went to the cardinals room	43.59433578333154
If she had not yet taken any repose he at least was already up	233.67900305990028
Six days had already passed out of the ten he had asked from Mordaunt he was therefore occupied in revising his reply to Cromwell when some one knocked gently at the door of communication with the queens apartments	207.200784225192
Anne of Austria alone was permitted to enter by that door	82.55293556627194
The cardinal therefore rose to open it	119.92379892220966
The queen was in a morning gown but it became her still for like Diana of Poictiers and Ninon Anne of Austria enjoyed the privilege of remaining ever beautiful nevertheless this morning she looked handsomer than usual for her eyes had all the sparkle inward satisfaction adds to expression	612.691922272113
What is the matter madame said Mazarin uneasily	255.53553114866477
Yes Giulio she said proud and happy for I have found the means of strangling this hydra	176.10800949950428
You are a great politician my queen said Mazarin let us hear the means	212.27919263798316
And he hid what he had written by sliding the letter under a folio of blank paper	331.7782457693344
You know said the queen that they want to take the king away from me	59.801779243040244
Alas yes and to hang me	14.40813239881758
They shall not have the king	364.31984920801887
I want to carry off my son from them with yourself	75.31323697674094
I wish that this event which on the day it is known will completely change the aspect of affairs should be accomplished without the knowledge of any others but yourself myself and a third person	137.53362438190672
And who is this third person	52.30862064235747
He has come then as they told me	17.934749576836026
And will he aid this project	1096.8297922602576
He will starve it out and force it to surrender at discretion	426.94215124505564
The plan is not wanting in grandeur I see but one impediment	516.5768453507662
A little said Mazarin trembling lest Anne should ask to draw upon his purse	240.66232460137195
Oh do think of it Giulio Paris this odious Paris waking up one morning without queen or king surrounded besieged famishedhaving for its sole resource its stupid parliament and their coadjutor with crooked limbs	2069.3990348364177
I can imagine the effect I do not see the means	30.460418196044927
I will find the means myself	210.51379825238462
You are aware it will be war civil war furious devouring implacable	7680.854095471327
Oh yes yes war said Anne of Austria	47.68414296438417
Yes I will reduce this rebellious city to ashes	5280.30152206556
I will extinguish the fire with blood I will perpetuate the crime and punishment by making a frightful example	186.95674664753813
Paris II detest I loathe it	15.953380093525729
You are now sanguinary but take care	167.275258155838
We are not in the time of Malatesta and Castruccio Castracani	2535.04095370207
You will get yourself decapitated my beautiful queen and that would be a pity	145.94748369270292
It is dangerous to go to war with a nation	219.53447781533458
Look at your brother monarch Charles I	1192.1666968659201
He is badly off very badly	12280.988853629939
We are in France and I am Spanish	148.67010728610612
So much the worse I had much rather you were French and myself also they would hate us both less	290.4232117062881
Yes if the thing be possible	399.6273141726826
It is it is I who tell you so make preparations for departure	238.58032682620043
I I am always prepared to go only as you know I never do go and perhaps shall go this time as little as before	116.87556025993553
In short if I go will you go too	287.8425064339626
You torment me Giulio with your fears and what are you afraid of then	71.19263671064341
Mazarins face smiling as it was became clouded	600.7814283612253
Anne said he you are but a woman and as a woman you may insult men at your ease knowing that you can do it with impunity	125.5370929568091
You accuse me of fear I have not so much as you have since I do not fly as you do	24.56004030742344
Against whom do they cry out is it against you or against myself Whom would they hang yourself or me Well I can weather the stormI whom notwithstanding you tax with fearnot with bravado that is not my way but I am firm	396.23164734848666
Make less hubbub and think more deeply	250.17961671275182
You cry very loud you end by doing nothing you talk of flying	487.28245789573674
Mazarin shrugged his shoulders and taking the queens hand led her to the window	40.51843195916207
Well said the queen blinded by her obstinacy	186.25901911551773
Well what do you see from this window If I am not mistaken those are citizens helmeted and mailed armed with good muskets as in the time of the League and whose eyes are so intently fixed on this window that they will see you if you raise that curtain much and now come to the other sidewhat do you see Creatures of the people armed with halberds guarding your doors	257.78884818501683
You will see the same at every opening from this palace to which I should lead you	144.3816456917812
Your doors are guarded the airholes of your cellars are guarded and I could say to you as that good La Ramee said to me of the Duc de Beaufort you must be either bird or mouse to get out	147.3077294387474
Do you think of escaping in the same way	22.869116037306423
Parbleu said Mazarin I have been proving it to you this last hour	84.80081415148405
And he quietly resumed his dispatch at the place where he had been interrupted	123.16317718209908
Anne trembling with anger and scarlet with humiliation left the room shutting the door violently after her	169.62166762143335
Mazarin did not even turn around	220.0256195014868
When once more in her own apartment Anne fell into a chair and wept then suddenly struck with an idea	94.52192258979116
I am saved she exclaimed rising oh yes yes I know a man who will find the means of taking me from Paris a man I have too long forgotten	59.97299094742678
Then falling into a reverie she added however with an expression of joy Ungrateful woman that I am for twenty years I have forgotten this man whom I ought to have made a marechal of France	66.34039640593313
My motherinlaw expended gold caresses dignities on Concini who ruined her the king made Vitry marechal of France for an assassination while I have left in obscurity in poverty the noble DArtagnan who saved me	421.4425249118944
And running to a table on which were paper pens and ink she hastily began to write	112.6445838261625
It had been DArtagnans practice ever since the riots to sleep in the same room as Porthos and on this eventful morning he was still there sleeping and dreaming that a yellow cloud had overspread the sky and was raining gold pieces into his hat which he held out till it was overflowing with pistoles	192.12748009756487
As for Porthos he dreamed that the panels of his carriage were not capacious enough to contain the armorial bearings he had ordered to be painted on them	143.41647633660202
They were both aroused at seven oclock by the entrance of an unliveried servant who brought a letter for DArtagnan	139.3771520458299
From the queen replied the servant	160.4234630651504
Ho said Porthos raising himself in his bed what does she say	81.0819814010311
DArtagnan requested the servant to wait in the next room and when the door was closed he sprang up from his bed and read rapidly whilst Porthos looked at him with starting eyes not daring to ask a single question	63.6297135464133
Friend Porthos said DArtagnan handing the letter to him this time at least you are sure of your title of baron and I of my captaincy	67.9194648656602
Porthos took the letter and with a trembling voice read the following words	43.6889736033631
The queen wishes to speak to Monsieur dArtagnan who must follow the bearer	158.55820613347072
Well exclaimed Porthos I see nothing in that very extraordinary	81.8194452730148
But I see much that is very extraordinary in it replied DArtagnan	117.62897768707573
It is evident by their sending for me that matters are becoming complicated	1027.2366302229184
Just reflect a little what an agitation the queens mind must be in for her to have remembered me after twenty years	274.95779012968876
Sharpen your sword baron load your pistols and give some corn to the horses for I will answer for it something lightninglike will happen ere tomorrow	234.33743834908023
But stop do you think it can be a trap that they are laying for us suggested Porthos incessantly thinking how his greatness must be irksome to inferior people	582.7737393509262
If it is a snare replied DArtagnan I shall scent it out be assured	365.86150964711663
If Mazarin is an Italian I am a Gascon	94.85518456412171
And DArtagnan dressed himself in an instant	66.82088212489614
Whilst Porthos still in bed was hooking on his cloak for him a second knock at the door was heard	111.4086322202854
Come in exclaimed DArtagnan and another servant entered	936.9700960744811
From His Eminence Cardinal Mazarin presenting a letter	329.40911790083055
A complicated affair said Porthos where will you begin	146.49117378537179
It is arranged capitally his eminence expects me in half an hour	195.13025957665718
My friend said DArtagnan turning to the servant tell his eminence that in half an hour I shall be at his command	53.101918857210045
It is very fortunate resumed the Gascon when the valet had retired that he did not meet the other one	62.14505352814455
Do you not think that they have sent for you both for the same thing	47.21985147966013
I do not think it I am certain of it	22.96881202176159
Remember that the queen awaits you and after the queen the cardinal and after the cardinal myself	198.35426893909766
DArtagnan summoned Anne of Austrias servant and signified that he was ready to follow him into the queens presence	79.19205077048127
The servant conducted him by the Rue des Petits Champs and turning to the left entered the little garden gate leading into the Rue Richelieu then they gained the private staircase and DArtagnan was ushered into the oratory	116.69510686529358
A certain emotion for which he could not account made the lieutenants heart beat he had no longer the assurance of youth experience had taught him the importance of past events	208.274674869484
Formerly he would have approached the queen as a young man who bends before a woman but now it was a different thing he answered her summons as an humble soldier obeys an illustrious general	183.5452102602374
The silence of the oratory was at last disturbed by the slight rustling of silk and DArtagnan started when he perceived the tapestry raised by a white hand which by its form its color and its beauty he recognized as that royal hand which had one day been presented to him to kiss	162.90349971758246
It is you Monsieur dArtagnan she said fixing a gaze full of melancholy interest on the countenance of the officer and I know you well	61.91823797480182
Look at me well in your turn	38.340966489833534
I am the queen do you recognize me	28.624258672911573
But are you no longer aware continued Anne giving that sweet expression to her voice which she could do at will that in former days the queen had once need of a young brave and devoted cavalierthat she found this cavalierand that although he might have thought that she had forgotten him she had kept a place for him in the depths of her heart	170.44717398810386
No madame I was ignorant of that said the musketeer	63.27514811048626
So much the worse sir said Anne of Austria so much the worse at least for the queen for today she has need of the same courage and the same devotion	90.91867154941241
What exclaimed DArtagnan does the queen surrounded as she is by such devoted servants such wise counselors men in short so great by merit or positiondoes she deign to cast her eyes on an obscure soldier	412.2220010690213
Anne understood this covert reproach and was more moved than irritated by it	150.78096518398726
She had many a time felt humiliated by the selfsacrifice and disinterestedness shown by the Gascon gentleman	839.4533636485348
She had allowed herself to be exceeded in generosity	1204.6607268971757
All that you tell me of those by whom I am surrounded Monsieur dArtagnan is doubtless true said the queen but I have confidence in you alone	108.26292027150267
I know that you belong to the cardinal but belong to me as well and I will take upon myself the making of your fortune	56.06904313367691
Come will you do today what formerly the gentleman you do not know did for the queen	153.07386212466778
I will do everything your majesty commands replied DArtagnan	651.1267562427656
The queen reflected for a moment and then seeing the cautious demeanor of the musketeer	111.24465234710286
Perhaps you like repose she said	7.265200424505421
I do not know for I have never had it madame	60.66977921720457
I had three two of whom have left Paris to go I know not where	108.20559597856398
One alone is left to me but he is one of those known I believe to the cavalier of whom your majesty did me the honor to speak	67.85177224629159
Very good said the queen you and your friend are worth an army	123.68927417501841
What am I to do madame	462.57838551207817
Return at five oclock and I will tell you but do not breathe to a living soul sir the rendezvous which I give you	92.6034817086148
Madame I have never been false to my word when I say I will not do a thing I mean it	82.50217163446072
The queen although astonished at this language to which she was not accustomed from her courtiers argued from it a happy omen of the zeal with which DArtagnan would serve her in the accomplishment of her project	197.34459034042305
It was one of the Gascons artifices to hide his deep cunning occasionally under an appearance of rough loyalty	1025.0298076979907
Has the queen any further commands for me now asked DArtagnan	417.4057330970079
No sir replied Anne of Austria and you may retire until the time that I mentioned to you	53.47510693438538
Diable he exclaimed when the door was shut they seem to have the greatest need of me just now	60.15368189959023
Then as the half hour had already glided by he crossed the gallery and knocked at the cardinals door	199.52842798179222
I come for your commands my lord he said	21.420160217572832
And according to his custom DArtagnan glanced rapidly around and remarked that Mazarin had a sealed letter before him	467.72671032432703
But it was so placed on the desk that he could not see to whom it was addressed	27.296244368100197
You come from the queen said Mazarin looking fixedly at DArtagnan	469.7256137067802
I my lordwho told you that	25.62242760282594
I regret infinitely to tell you my lord that you are mistaken replied the Gascon impudently firm to the promise he had just made to Anne of Austria	69.22976294602059
I opened the door of the anteroom myself and I saw you enter at the end of the corridor	31.886231062024304
Because I was shown up the private stairs	279.9401092809874
I know not it must have been a mistake	22.958804545835374
Mazarin was aware that it was not easy to make DArtagnan reveal anything he was desirous of hiding so he gave up for the time the discovery of the mystery the Gascon was concealing	163.24363677650035
Let us speak of my affairs said Mazarin since you will tell me naught of yours	124.05902892131083
My life has been passed on the high road	27.59458676416732
Would anything retain you particularly in Paris	100.41310690404923
Nothing but an order from a superior would retain me in Paris	244.54064741800454
Here is a letter which must be taken to its address	67.81080679256172
To its address my lord But it has none	127.56607701235352
In fact the side of the letter opposite the seal was blank	356.7000041986942
I must tell you resumed Mazarin that it is in a double envelope	247.12144097157886
I understand and I am to take off the first one when I have reached a certain place	87.10397566222314
Just so take it and go	128.8677368882433
You have a friend Monsieur du Vallon whom I like much let him accompany you	115.57835707364616
The devil said DArtagnan to himself	59.881588040957716
He knows that we overheard his conversation yesterday and he wants to get us away from Paris	135.42762318622968
No my lord and I will set out at once	35.76897911927022
There is one thing only which I must request	307.9502025432507
That your eminence will go at once to the queen	38.220348362522685
Merely to say these words I am going to send Monsieur dArtagnan away and I wish him to set out directly	107.78301525823892
I told you said Mazarin that you had seen the queen	36.56162242960073
I had the honor of saying to your eminence that there had been some mistake	108.80055387075672
What is the meaning of that	32.204262751070885
May I venture to repeat my prayer to your eminence	240.62453944884746
And looking attentively around him to see if he had left any of his keys in his closets Mazarin went out	106.74250190447731
Ten minutes elapsed during which DArtagnan made every effort to read through the first envelope what was written on the second	179.6204214496539
Mazarin returned pale and evidently thoughtful	2187.618796984705
He seated himself at his desk and DArtagnan proceeded to examine his face as he had just examined the letter he held but the envelope which covered his countenance appeared as impenetrable as that which covered the letter	112.97953806633254
Ah thought the Gascon he looks displeased	15094.490587229819
Can it be with me He meditates	5869.482246602231
Is it about sending me to the Bastile All very fine my lord but at the very first hint you give of such a thing I will strangle you and become Frondist	293.6828080040363
I should be carried home in triumph like Monsieur Broussel and Athos would proclaim me the French Brutus	669.1324932350096
The Gascon with his vivid imagination had already seen the advantage to be derived from his situation	143.68135724775692
Mazarin gave however no order of the kind but on the contrary began to be insinuating	68.91472973134975
You were right he said my dear Monsieur dArtagnan and you can not set out yet	106.16195703766198
I beg you to return me that dispatch	672.783769908081
DArtagnan obeyed and Mazarin ascertained that the seal was intact	197.55303314355564
I shall want you this evening he said Return in two hours	143.52696817595478
My lord said DArtagnan I have an appointment in two hours which I can not miss	68.49851303776285
Do not be uneasy said Mazarin it is the same	43.22301482022297
Good thought DArtagnan I fancied it was so	22.40633313085847
Return then at five oclock and bring that worthy Monsieur du Vallon with you	191.7800037587475
Only leave him in the anteroom as I wish to speak to you alone	32.5282942095295
DArtagnan bowed and thought Both at the same hour both commands alike both at the Palais Royal	214.06551550328524
Monsieur de Gondy would pay a hundred thousand francs for such a secret	14.883302639831863
You are thoughtful said Mazarin uneasily	1057.600048497509
Yes I was thinking whether we ought to come armed or not	131.8938319812066
Armed to the teeth replied Mazarin	2956.905427277656
Very well my lord it shall be so	12.352891277457378
DArtagnan saluted went out and hastened to repeat to his friend Mazarins flattering promises which gave Porthos an indescribable happiness	765.3299415857756
When DArtagnan returned to the Palais Royal at five oclock it presented in spite of the excitement which reigned in the town a spectacle of the greatest rejoicing	119.66914976217238
The queen had restored Broussel and Blancmesnil to the people and had therefore nothing to fear since the people had nothing more just then to ask for	130.5227225169356
The return also of the conqueror of Lens was the pretext for giving a grand banquet	478.25661535751976
The princes and princesses were invited and their carriages had crowded the court since noon then after dinner the queen was to have a play in her apartment	225.1165012954811
Anne of Austria had never appeared more brilliant than on that dayradiant with grace and wit	537.2104616209247
Mazarin disappeared as they rose from table	808.7139736858592
He found DArtagnan waiting for him already at his post in the anteroom	60.72564418257838
The cardinal advanced to him with a smile and taking him by the hand led him into his study	24.56366052870484
dArtagnan said the minister sitting down I am about to give you the greatest proof of confidence that a minister can give an officer	58.765996230348485
I hope said DArtagnan bowing that you give it my lord without hesitation and with the conviction that I am worthy of it	88.06414279524577
More worthy than any one in Paris my dear friend therefore I apply to you	62.02002967927039
We are about to leave this evening continued Mazarin	429.52781596889037
dArtagnan the welfare of the state is deposited in your hands	187.61333314191975
Explain yourself my lord I am listening	87.3333810426791
The queen has resolved to make a little excursion with the king to Saint Germain	83.33206184039007
Aha said DArtagnan that is to say the queen wishes to leave Paris	82.03707744187811
Yes I understand perfectly said DArtagnan	3185.90022518568
It was for this she summoned you this morning and that she told you to return at five oclock	89.86093924271908
Was it worth while to wish me to swear this morning that I would mention the appointment to no one muttered DArtagnan	188.15324134238668
Oh women women whether queens or not they are always the same	57.15818813616795
Do you disapprove of this journey my dear M	78.77889707152573
I my lord said DArtagnan why should I	32.516561189467005
It is a way I have of speaking to myself	142.21341728019013
I neither approve nor disapprove my lord I merely await your commands	177.80138769919802
Good it is you accordingly that I have pitched upon to conduct the king and the queen to Saint Germain	104.40691523657749
You see therefore continued the cardinal perceiving DArtagnans composure that as I have told you the welfare of the state is placed in your hands	198.87916597160606
Yes my lord and I feel the whole responsibility of such a charge	131.34449132273335
Do you think the thing possible	2586.540564331998
Shall you be attacked on the road	8.80599291900893
And what will you do in that case	72.70137253697494
I shall pass through those who attack me	312.1788585761673
And suppose you can not pass through them	42.88136014890998
So much the worse for them I shall pass over them	34.73997843241321
And you will place the king and queen in safety also at Saint Germain	372.485741205195
You are a hero my friend said Mazarin gazing at the musketeer with admiration	133.8951640481762
And I asked Mazarin after a moments silence	20.92613499966434
That would be much more difficult	106.28359992824137
Even under this disguise asked Mazarin raising a cloak which covered an armchair upon which lay a complete dress for an officer of pearlgray and red entirely embroidered with silver	203.74735485493107
If your eminence is disguised it will be almost easy	84.17264361710298
Ah said Mazarin breathing more freely	222.67409980354273
But it will be necessary for your eminence to do what the other day you declared you should have done in our placecry Down with Mazarin	159.06765301382742
In French in good French my lord take care of your accent they killed six thousand Angevins in Sicily because they pronounced Italian badly	594.7714548894328
Take care that the French do not take their revenge on you for the Sicilian vespers	147.1748541985667
The streets are full of armed men continued DArtagnan	1518.8733545727273
Are you sure that no one is aware of the queens project	127.65163780999961
This affair would give a fine opportunity for a traitor my lord the chance of being attacked would be an excuse for everything	125.99189826567198
Mazarin shuddered but he reflected that a man who had the least intention to betray would not warn first	164.55244242669198
And therefore added he quietly I have not confidence in every one the proof of which is that I have fixed upon you to escort me	71.16706855006973
Shall you not go with the queen	128.12552097501748
Then you will start after the queen	100.52858968887118
Ah said DArtagnan who began to understand	11.557292083497396
With the queen I double her risk after the queen her departure would double mine then the court once safe I might be forgotten	397.48395401109906
Very true said DArtagnan fixing his eyes in spite of himself on the queens diamond which Mazarin wore on his finger	72.8672635426482
Mazarin followed the direction of his eyes and gently turned the hoop of the ring inside	230.83427788234732
I wish he said with his cunning smile to prevent them from being ungrateful to me	127.60204678283144
It is but Christian charity replied DArtagnan not to lead ones neighbors into temptation	1056.2890015767655
It is exactly for that reason said Mazarin that I wish to start before them	98.69917734676754
DArtagnan smiledhe was just the man to understand the astute Italian	276.3759226780865
Mazarin saw the smile and profited by the moment	158.66614270205542
You will begin therefore by taking me first out of Paris will you not my dear M	51.68645189049626
A difficult commission my lord replied DArtagnan resuming his serious manner	820.1290687049608
But said Mazarin you did not make so many difficulties with regard to the king and queen	62.21514990077063
The king and the queen are my king and queen replied the musketeer my life is theirs and I must give it for them	126.77442450051979
If they ask it what have I to say	75.85025298822555
That is true murmured Mazarin in a low tone but as thy life is not mine I suppose I must buy it must I not and sighing deeply he began to turn the hoop of his ring outside again	102.71863591707971
These two men met at one point and that was cunning had they been actuated equally by courage the one would have done great things for the other	170.45646065687907
But also said Mazarin you must understand that if I ask this service from you it is with the intention of being grateful	55.89923486676103
Is it still only an intention your eminence asked DArtagnan	782.3911840043653
Stay said Mazarin drawing the ring from his finger my dear DArtagnan there is a diamond which belonged to you formerly it is but just it should return to you take it I pray	83.46306234816393
DArtagnan spared Mazarin the trouble of insisting and after looking to see if the stone was the same and assuring himself of the purity of its water he took it and passed it on his finger with indescribable pleasure	90.18653554765619
I valued it much said Mazarin giving a last look at it nevertheless I give it to you with great pleasure	86.48761485239369
And I my lord said DArtagnan accept it as it is given	317.9549879585489
Come let us speak of your little affairs	153.67186816203522
You wish to leave before everybody and at what hour	299.5648075716114
And the queen at what time is it her wish to start	147.2192027157389
I can get you out of Paris and leave you beyond the barriere and can return for her	107.04223411869837
Capital but how will you get me out of Paris	41.695900033066955
Oh as to that you must leave it to me	24.48727753632668
I give you absolute power therefore take as large an escort as you like	281.7076756480755
It seems to me however said Mazarin the safest method	611.1520679032286
Yes for you my lord but not for the queen you must leave it to me and give me the entire direction of the undertaking	59.83340938917721
Or find some one else continued DArtagnan turning his back	554.6981311630018
Oh muttered Mazarin I do believe he is going off with the diamond M	151.95046054808935
dArtagnan he called out in a coaxing voice will you answer for everything	172.11877250232695
Well then let us goI must trust to you	46.46701071337179
It is very fortunate said DArtagnan to himself	158.04391953343338
You will be here at halfpast nine	760.7015534443401
And I shall find your eminence ready	1791.3222348078004
Well then it is a settled thing and now my lord will you obtain for me an audience with the queen	110.73541437570103
I wish to receive her majestys commands from her own lips	139.97221241171087
She desired me to give them to you	15.24240274667604
You really wish to see her	75.11797283042355
Mazarin hesitated for one instant but DArtagnan was firm	596.1153600891149
Come then said the minister I will conduct you to her but remember not one word of our conversation	74.81126627614175
What has passed between us concerns ourselves alone my lord replied DArtagnan	827.896443574706
I never swear my lord I say yes or no and as I am a gentleman I keep my word	103.48364401300852
Come then I see that I must trust unreservedly to you	210.89730904942869
Believe me my lord it will be your best plan	44.38913629535053
Come said Mazarin conducting DArtagnan into the queens oratory and desiring him to wait there	195.39189968092305
He did not wait long for in five minutes the queen entered in full gala costume	154.0992434164881
Thus dressed she scarcely appeared thirtyfive years of age	146.03756167536764
It is you Monsieur DArtagnan she said smiling graciously I thank you for having insisted on seeing me	156.1914475498749
I ought to ask your majestys pardon but I wished to receive your commands from your own mouth	76.21537458744888
Do you accept the commission which I have intrusted to you	46.68416593868321
Very well be here at midnight	535.095094099427
Monsieur dArtagnan continued the queen I know your disinterestedness too well to speak of my own gratitude at such a moment but I swear to you that I shall not forget this second service as I forgot the first	57.80394696063175
Your majesty is free to forget or to remember as it pleases you and I know not what you mean said DArtagnan bowing	111.5885845554436
Go sir said the queen with her most bewitching smile go and return at midnight	168.60650663541225
And DArtagnan retired but as he passed out he glanced at the curtain through which the queen had entered and at the bottom of the tapestry he remarked the tip of a velvet slipper	62.20330246090755
Good thought he Mazarin has been listening to discover whether I betrayed him	107.39229883011825
In truth that Italian puppet does not deserve the services of an honest man	47.190565326556715
DArtagnan was not less exact to his appointment and at halfpast nine oclock he entered the anteroom	74.03678501631931
He found the cardinal dressed as an officer and he looked very well in that costume which as we have already said he wore elegantly only he was very pale and trembled slightly	121.07479610483163
And that worthy Monsieur du Vallon are we not to enjoy his society	110.18588053396037
Certainly my lord he is waiting in his carriage at the gate of the garden of the Palais Royal	32.34338384509943
And we start in his carriage then	61.76735929421245
And with us no other escort but you two	346.8788759737844
Is it not enough One of us would suffice	105.12043506839646
Really my dear Monsieur dArtagnan said the cardinal your coolness startles me	379.1394071047711
I should have thought on the contrary that it ought to have inspired you with confidence	54.52565564088434
And Bernouindo I not take him with me	16.055213731464537
There is no room for him he will rejoin your eminence	173.15841549153703
Let us go said Mazarin since everything must be done as you wish	38.486866108990604
My lord there is time to draw back said DArtagnan and your eminence is perfectly free	113.48903308472397
Not at all not at all said Mazarin let us be off	98.3557641839577
And so they descended the private stair Mazarin leaning on the arm of DArtagnan a hand the musketeer felt trembling	513.6870610233574
At last after crossing the courts of the Palais Royal where there still remained some of the conveyances of late guests they entered the garden and reached the little gate	125.29837394954934
Mazarin attempted to open it by a key which he took from his pocket but with such shaking fingers that he could not find the keyhole	62.795745324112055
Give it to me said DArtagnan who when the gate was open deposited the key in his pocket reckoning upon returning by that gate	199.57241543292818
The steps were already down and the door open	30.990954634372304
Mousqueton stood at the door and Porthos was inside the carriage	392.5458513950717
Mount my lord said DArtagnan to Mazarin who sprang into the carriage without waiting for a second bidding	116.62436143725651
DArtagnan followed him and Mousqueton having closed the door mounted behind the carriage with many groans	102.19473371560156
He had made some difficulties about going under pretext that he still suffered from his wound but DArtagnan had said to him	187.81346146437997
Remain if you like my dear Monsieur Mouston but I warn you that Paris will be burnt down tonight upon which Mousqueton had declared without asking anything further that he was ready to follow his master and Monsieur dArtagnan to the end of the world	103.4579889913197
The carriage started at a measured pace without betraying by the slightest sign that it contained people in a hurry	217.81412588276748
The cardinal wiped his forehead with his handkerchief and looked around him	14.380990736074239
On his left was Porthos whilst DArtagnan was on his right each guarded a door and served as a rampart to him on either side	202.8704547653151
Before him on the front seat lay two pairs of pistolsone in front of Porthos and the other of DArtagnan	344.11798797805136
About a hundred paces from the Palais Royal a patrol stopped the carriage	211.56498722015758
Mazarin replied DArtagnan bursting into a laugh	48.879567869412575
The cardinals hair stood on end	65.79296693172554
But the joke appeared an excellent one to the citizens who seeing the conveyance without escort and unarmed would never have believed in the possibility of so great an imprudence	261.344613281536
A good journey to ye they cried allowing it to pass	188.55671502334593
Hem said DArtagnan what does my lord think of that reply	387.7532830917893
In truth said Porthos I understand but now	182.39077221667497
About the middle of the Rue des Petits Champs they were stopped by a second patrol	252.4245547012512
Who goes there inquired the captain of the patrol	136.31262986164046
Keep back my lord said DArtagnan	2133.761758188343
And Mazarin buried himself so far behind the two friends that he disappeared completely hidden between them	179.44847327637356
Who goes there cried the same voice impatiently whilst DArtagnan perceived that they had rushed to the horses heads	448.1605059300212
But putting his head out of the carriage	10.637045946130598
The chief approached and it was indeed Planchet DArtagnan had recognized the voice of his old servant	110.46741071128434
How sir said Planchet is it you	14.269156318312353
Eh mon Dieu yes my good friend this worthy Porthos has just received a sword wound and I am taking him to his country house at Saint Cloud	206.37191541158072
Porthos said DArtagnan if you can still speak say a word my dear Porthos to this good Planchet	282.58778138051406
Planchet my friend said Porthos in a melancholy voice I am very ill should you meet a doctor you will do me a favor by sending him to me	66.28493397191588
Oh good Heaven said Planchet what a misfortune and how did it happen	134.32110894626763
I will tell you all about it replied Mousqueton	152.05517889344836
Make way for us Planchet said DArtagnan in a whisper to him or he will not arrive alive the lungs are attacked my friend	121.37077264825429
Planchet shook his head with the air of a man who says In that case things look ill	47.1306721242613
Then he exclaimed turning to his men	104.91870838218142
Let them pass they are friends	343.7195650501555
The carriage resumed its course and Mazarin who had held his breath ventured to breathe again	123.49181864915006
A few steps in advance of the gate of Saint Honore they met a third troop this latter party was composed of illlooking fellows who resembled bandits more than anything else they were the men of the beggar of Saint Eustache	227.31720507523676
Porthos placed his hand on the pistols	78.6672869478382
My lord I think we are in bad company	69.45747736393281
A man advanced to the door with a kind of scythe in his hand	52.20244404760687
Eh rascal said DArtagnan do you not recognize his highness the princes carriage	177.049989246315
Prince or not said the man open	795.8067154668508
We are here to guard the gate and no one whom we do not know shall pass	38.91584311255466
What is to be done said Porthos	168.70331533592488
Through or over coachman gallop on	49.1524663227731
Not a step further said the man who appeared to be the captain or I will hamstring your horses	72.44930405512234
Peste said Porthos it would be a pity animals which cost me a hundred pistoles each	151.72656441706366
I will pay you two hundred for them said Mazarin	107.0038503691625
Yes but when once they are hamstrung our necks will be strung next	1210.7336207316619
If one of them comes to my side asked Porthos must I kill him	190.63922504859946
Yes by a blow of your fist if you can we will not fire but at the last extremity	89.61162459398169
I can do it said Porthos	4329.333769547774
Come and open then cried DArtagnan to the man with the scythe taking one of the pistols up by the muzzle and preparing to strike with the handle	105.17547496162621
And as the man approached DArtagnan in order to have more freedom for his actions leaned half out of the door his eyes were fixed upon those of the mendicant which were lighted up by a lantern	82.54544249018335
Without doubt he recognized DArtagnan for he became deadly pale doubtless the musketeer knew him for his hair stood up on his head	178.88349286837487
Monsieur dArtagnan he cried falling back a step it is Monsieur dArtagnan let him pass	187.36380683994153
DArtagnan was perhaps about to reply when a blow similar to that of a mallet falling on the head of an ox was heard	75.7781666459508
The noise was caused by Porthos who had just knocked down his man	138.81962102025773
DArtagnan turned around and saw the unfortunate man upon his back about four paces off	124.49816525748949
Sdeath cried he to the coachman	1793.2844807959173
Spur your horses whip get on	16.620533762268
The coachman bestowed a heavy blow of the whip upon his horses the noble animals bounded forward then cries of men who were knocked down were heard then a double concussion was felt and two of the wheels seemed to pass over a round and flexible body	218.04843611546207
There was a moments silence then the carriage cleared the gate	134.92950986253345
To Cours la Reine cried DArtagnan to the coachman then turning to Mazarin he said Now my lord you can say five paters and five aves in thanks to Heaven for your deliverance	303.7783839571761
Mazarin replied only by a groan he could not believe in such a miracle	53.13371174414365
Five minutes later the carriage stopped having reached Cours la Reine	780.3177963142534
Is my lord pleased with his escort asked DArtagnan	795.0237320827243
Enchanted monsieur said Mazarin venturing his head out of one of the windows and now do as much for the queen	54.54158986220744
It will not be so difficult replied DArtagnan springing to the ground	292.98286204356873
Monsieur du Vallon I commend his eminence to your care	150.4502714698129
Be quite at ease said Porthos holding out his hand which DArtagnan took and shook in his	121.34270751308803
Oh cried Porthos as if in pain	539.1662916346331
DArtagnan looked with surprise at his friend	53.49597990995554
What is the matter then he asked	37.751431933256264
I think I have sprained my wrist said Porthos	227.2883404199395
The devil why you strike like a blind or a deaf man	146.3722858102474
It was necessary my man was going to fire a pistol at me but youhow did you get rid of yours	145.51244403355832
Oh mine replied DArtagnan was not a man	14.30508014292183
Without further explanation DArtagnan took the pistols which were upon the front seat placed them in his belt wrapped himself in his cloak and not wishing to enter by the same gate as that through which they had left he took his way toward the Richelieu gate	91.0151243317351
The Carriage of Monsieur le Coadjuteur	1619.248738321232
Instead of returning then by the Saint Honore gate DArtagnan who had time before him walked around and reentered by the Porte Richelieu	218.98005593121744
He was approached to be examined and when it was discovered by his plumed hat and his laced coat that he was an officer of the musketeers he was surrounded with the intention of making him cry Down with Mazarin The demonstration did not fail to make him uneasy at first but when he discovered what it meant he shouted it in such a voice that even the most exacting were satisfied	115.76677545995672
He walked down the Rue Richelieu meditating how he should carry off the queen in her turn for to take her in a carriage bearing the arms of France was not to be thought of when he perceived an equipage standing at the door of the hotel belonging to Madame de Guemenee	72.74979556158311
He was struck by a sudden idea	151.00205609064412
Ah pardieu he exclaimed that would be fair play	735.0202648791968
And approaching the carriage he examined the arms on the panels and the livery of the coachman on his box	72.37241083699014
This scrutiny was so much the more easy the coachman being sound asleep	554.2239949267841
It is in truth monsieur le coadjuteurs carriage said DArtagnan upon my honor I begin to think that Heaven favors us	448.11300894491944
He mounted noiselessly into the chariot and pulled the silk cord which was attached to the coachmans little finger	282.16046108827857
To the Palais Royal he called out	63.891237052074835
The coachman awoke with a start and drove off in the direction he was desired never doubting but that the order had come from his master	118.47352638982407
The porter at the palace was about to close the gates but seeing such a handsome equipage he fancied that it was some visit of importance and the carriage was allowed to pass and to stop beneath the porch	124.83467398760537
It was then only the coachman perceived the grooms were not behind the vehicle he fancied monsieur le coadjuteur had sent them back and without dropping the reins he sprang from his box to open the door	164.74931781128404
DArtagnan in his turn sprang to the ground and just at the moment when the coachman alarmed at not seeing his master fell back a step he seized him by his collar with the left whilst with the right hand he placed the muzzle of a pistol at his breast	66.2442123602587
Pronounce one single word muttered DArtagnan and you are a dead man	54.336683031188194
The coachman perceived at once by the expression of the man who thus addressed him that he had fallen into a trap and he remained with his mouth wide open and his eyes portentously staring	66.90914216738877
Two musketeers were pacing the court to whom DArtagnan called by their names	268.3478171249987
Monsieur de Belliere said he to one of them do me the favor to take the reins from the hands of this worthy man mount upon the box and drive to the door of the private stair and wait for me there it is an affair of importance on the service of the king	57.24587088857722
The musketeer who knew that his lieutenant was incapable of jesting with regard to the service obeyed without a word although he thought the order strange	219.46858777012923
Then turning toward the second musketeer DArtagnan said	3968.844076810023
Monsieur du Verger help me to place this man in a place of safety	53.87582199291535
The musketeer thinking that his lieutenant had just arrested some prince in disguise bowed and drawing his sword signified that he was ready	225.91379131883724
DArtagnan mounted the staircase followed by his prisoner who in his turn was followed by the soldier and entered Mazarins anteroom	130.09294487643737
Bernouin was waiting there impatient for news of his master	66.25771572406875
Everything goes on capitally my dear Monsieur Bernouin but here is a man whom I must beg you to put in a safe place	52.25246673022542
Where you like provided that the place which you shall choose has iron shutters secured by padlocks and a door that can be locked	318.98213961881765
We have that sir replied Bernouin and the poor coachman was conducted to a closet the windows of which were barred and which looked very much like a prison	157.35625263845068
And now my good friend said DArtagnan to him I must invite you to deprive yourself for my sake of your hat and cloak	71.33856328929468
The coachman as we can well understand made no resistance in fact he was so astonished at what had happened to him that he stammered and reeled like a drunken man DArtagnan deposited his clothes under the arm of one of the valets	111.98238116546368
And now Monsieur du Verger he said shut yourself up with this man until Monsieur Bernouin returns to open the door	110.01834156093572
The duty will be tolerably long and not very amusing I know but added he seriously you understand it is on the kings service	122.78380561834298
At your command lieutenant replied the musketeer who saw the business was a serious one	128.13546457361622
Bythebye continued DArtagnan should this man attempt to fly or to call out pass your sword through his body	126.69985576013757
The musketeer signified by a nod that these commands should be obeyed to the letter and DArtagnan went out followed by Bernouin	222.39547712891397
Lead me into the queens oratory said DArtagnan announce to her I am here and put this parcel with a wellloaded musket under the seat of the carriage which is waiting at the foot of the private stair	128.3498390900095
Bernouin conducted DArtagnan to the oratory where he sat down pensively	341.57416098382515
Everything had gone on as usual at the Palais Royal	44.044537370995414
As we said before by ten oclock almost all the guests had dispersed those who were to fly with the court had the word of command and they were each severally desired to be from twelve oclock to one at Cours la Reine	169.65922670625326
At ten oclock Anne of Austria had entered the kings room	35.03898415451652
Monsieur had just retired and the youthful Louis remaining the last was amusing himself by placing some lead soldiers in a line of battle a game which delighted him much	452.7378900079562
Two royal pages were playing with him	20.412035968834836
Laporte said the queen it is time for his majesty to go to bed	38.54824536609269
The king asked to remain up having he said no wish to sleep but the queen was firm	199.8998309352918
Are you not going tomorrow morning at six oclock Louis to bathe at Conflans I think you wished to do so of your own accord	107.33581907694378
You are right madame said the king and I am ready to retire to my room when you have kissed me	35.43618536050389
Laporte give the light to Monsieur the Chevalier de Coislin	793.5004562209538
The queen touched with her lips the white smooth brow the royal child presented to her with a gravity which already partook of etiquette	239.99974878469516
Go to sleep soon Louis said the queen for you must be awakened very early	121.47327163224935
I will do my best to obey you madame said the youthful king but I have no inclination to sleep	90.85315460689533
Laporte said Anne of Austria in an undertone find some very dull book to read to his majesty but do not undress yourself	148.16632654603538
The king went out accompanied by the Chevalier de Coislin bearing the candlestick and then the queen returned to her own apartment	109.58310876693832
Her ladiesthat is to say Madame de Bregy Mademoiselle de Beaumont Madame de Motteville and Socratine her sister so called on account of her sensehad just brought into her dressingroom the remains of the dinner on which according to her usual custom she supped	319.4808326460847
The queen then gave her orders spoke of a banquet which the Marquis de Villequier was to give to her on the day after the morrow indicated the persons she would admit to the honor of partaking of it announced another visit on the following day to ValdeGrace where she intended to pay her devotions and gave her commands to her senior valet to accompany her	153.1367350214034
When the ladies had finished their supper the queen feigned extreme fatigue and passed into her bedroom	477.4641785127752
Madame de Motteville who was on especial duty that evening followed to aid and undress her	556.3752235766498
The queen then began to read and after conversing with her affectionately for a few minutes dismissed her	154.54417690897824
It was at this moment DArtagnan entered the courtyard of the palace in the coadjutors carriage and a few seconds later the carriages of the ladiesinwaiting drove out and the gates were shut after them	136.73303990867993
A few minutes after twelve oclock Bernouin knocked at the queens bedroom door having come by the cardinals secret corridor	706.9489445300703
Anne of Austria opened the door to him herself	41.40829684724056
She was dressed that is to say in dishabille wrapped in a long warm dressinggown	316.3975387304859
It is you Bernouin she said	2.6145429785087244
He is waiting till your majesty is ready	99.15134513286989
Go and tell Laporte to wake and dress the king and then pass on to the Marechal de Villeroy and summon him to me	142.76688835277625
The queen entered her oratory which was lighted by a single lamp of Venetian crystal She saw DArtagnan who stood expecting her	197.31897335859026
Has got off without any accident	73.39018412899765
He is awaiting your majesty at Cours la Reine	383.1194168966242
But in what carriage do we start	1087.3050280207215
I have provided for everything a carriage below is waiting for your majesty	221.1282180784551
Let us go to the king	3930.8926581227506
DArtagnan bowed and followed the queen	3415.977692737957
The young Louis was already dressed with the exception of his shoes and doublet he had allowed himself to be dressed in great astonishment overwhelming Laporte with questions who replied only in these words Sire it is by the queens commands	213.63424884593127
The bedclothes were thrown back exposing the kings bed linen which was so worn that here and there holes could be seen	441.2102164410358
It was one of the results of Mazarins niggardliness	5531.936193867032
The queen entered and DArtagnan remained at the door	15.22811830462544
As soon as the child perceived the queen he escaped from Laporte and ran to meet her	159.0056048726001
Anne then motioned to DArtagnan to approach and he obeyed	166.15491405411024
My son said Anne of Austria pointing to the musketeer calm standing uncovered here is Monsieur dArtagnan who is as brave as one of those ancient heroes of whom you like so much to hear from my women	127.84350874788989
Remember his name well and look at him well that his face may not be forgotten for this evening he is going to render us a great service	63.2023220249098
The young king looked at the officer with his largeformed eye and repeated	246.80194386811772
The young king slowly raised his little hand and held it out to the musketeer the latter bent on his knee and kissed it	76.22294636045322
Monsieur dArtagnan repeated Louis very well madame	310.8505627726681
At this moment they were startled by a noise as if a tumult were approaching	124.82700939933969
What is that exclaimed the queen	606.8139268338687
Oh oh replied DArtagnan straining both at the same time his quick ear and his intelligent glance it is the murmur of the populace in revolution	128.1424048567703
We must fly said the queen	628.161427747983
Your majesty has given me the control of this business we had better wait and see what they want	141.15772513564963
Nothing is so catching as confidence	1716.0094161040056
The queen full of energy and courage was quickly alive to these two virtues in others	209.66339932739248
Do as you like she said I rely upon you	35.41431164194917
Will your majesty permit me to give orders in your name throughout this business	128.27384786581393
What do the people want this time demanded the king	136.27718324389357
We are about to ascertain sire replied DArtagnan as he rapidly left the room	195.8558630732247
The tumult continued to increase and seemed to surround the Palais Royal entirely	204.09246040283625
Cries were heard from the interior of which they could not comprehend the sense	86.56043448731808
It was evident that there was clamor and sedition	903.6425620946437
The king half dressed the queen and Laporte remained each in the same state and almost in the same place where they were listening and waiting	109.79375765256145
Comminges who was on guard that night at the Palais Royal ran in	77.06723848083237
He had about two hundred men in the courtyards and stables and he placed them at the queens disposal	236.48963606854554
Well asked Anne of Austria when DArtagnan reappeared what does it mean	555.4055714374634
It means madame that the report has spread that the queen has left the Palais Royal carrying off the king and the people ask to have proof to the contrary or threaten to demolish the Palais Royal	167.56859444385057
Oh this time it is too much exclaimed the queen and I will prove to them I have not left	47.88916565459879
DArtagnan saw from the expression of the queens face that she was about to issue some violent command	91.4868649550522
He approached her and said in a low voice	5.630112038378112
Has your majesty still confidence in me	56.908232258063194
Yes sir she replied every confidence speak	5751.659659839339
Will the queen deign to follow my advice	98.41288370988359
de Comminges and desire him to shut himself up with his men in the guardhouse and in the stables	68.72837455876301
Comminges glanced at DArtagnan with the envious look with which every courtier sees a new favorite spring up	493.59346014368987
You hear Comminges said the queen	468.0543238784967
DArtagnan went up to him with his usual quickness he caught the anxious glance	135.97748872950874
Monsieur de Comminges he said pardon me we both are servants of the queen are we not It is my turn to be of use to her do not envy me this happiness	138.04898086412203
Come said DArtagnan to himself I have got one more enemy	130.51533855433092
And now said the queen addressing DArtagnan what is to be done for you hear that instead of becoming calmer the noise increases	312.9475866003166
Madame said DArtagnan the people want to see the king and they must see him	51.58471745589264
What must see him Whereon the balcony	379.15212057129486
Not at all madame but here sleeping in his bed	176.7132327940169
Oh your majesty exclaimed Laporte Monsieur dArtagnan is right	772.8450185971805
The queen became thoughtful and smiled like a woman to whom duplicity is no stranger	231.44069392187492
Monsieur Laporte said DArtagnan go and announce to the people through the grating that they are going to be satisfied and that in five minutes they shall not only see the king but they shall see him in bed add that the king sleeps and that the queen begs that they will keep silence so as not to awaken him	103.23154797639889
But not every one a deputation of two or four people	117.61754692720594
But reflect they will keep us here till daybreak	283.9226513315384
It shall take but a quarter of an hour I answer for everything madame believe me I know the people they are like a great child who only wants humoring	112.37541633731614
Before the sleeping king they will be mute gentle and timid as lambs	443.48525037437304
The young king approached his mother and said Why do as these people ask	332.64273184582123
It must be so my son said Anne of Austria	48.85340161263729
But if they say it must be to me am I no longer king	71.60004907266651
Sire said DArtagnan will your majesty permit me to ask you a question	40.21197552194083
turned around astonished that any one should dare to address him	65.77712832450756
But the queen pressed the childs hand	434.7709437885372
Does your majesty remember when playing in the park of Fontainebleau or in the palace courts at Versailles ever to have seen the sky grow suddenly dark and heard the sound of thunder	200.3450705907628
Well then this noise of thunder however much your majesty may have wished to continue playing has said go in sire	899.8363190495951
Certainly sir but they tell me that the noise of thunder is the voice of God	41.258028565423515
Well then sire continued DArtagnan listen to the noise of the people you will perceive that it resembles that of thunder	88.96020564863363
In truth at that moment a terrible murmur was wafted to them by the night breeze then all at once it ceased	202.52054597043758
Hold sire said DArtagnan they have just told the people that you are asleep you see you still are king	113.7030513558954
The queen looked with surprise at this strange man whose brilliant courage made him the equal of the bravest and who was by his fine and quick intelligence the equal of the most astute	113.63686126746593
Madame he replied Monsieur dArtagnans prediction has been accomplished they are calm as if by enchantment	241.53748695990822
The doors are about to be opened and in five minutes they will be here	32.29067757964495
Laporte said the queen suppose you put one of your sons in the kings place we might be off during the time	80.38184652598069
If your majesty desires it said Laporte my sons like myself are at the queens service	449.95825401476503
Not at all said DArtagnan should one of them know his majesty and discover but a substitute all would be lost	195.93329591643914
You are right sir always right said Anne of Austria	59.880435907572505
Laporte place the king in bed	211.69416038747917
Laporte placed the king dressed as he was in the bed and then covered him as far as the shoulders with the sheet	38.13127634082738
The queen bent over him and kissed his brow	88.57135141401979
Pretend to sleep Louis said she	142.58754602360244
Yes said the king but I do not wish to be touched by any of those men	20.678580455860438
Sire I am here said DArtagnan and I give you my word that if a single man has the audacity his life shall pay for it	77.60983648735184
And now what is to be done asked the queen for I hear them	47.50868744552393
Monsieur Laporte go to them and again recommend silence	1022.77608111115
Madame wait at the door whilst I shall be at the head of the kings bed ready to die for him	54.90168347375302
Laporte went out the queen remained standing near the hangings whilst DArtagnan glided behind the curtains	600.8377580456655
Then the heavy and collected steps of a multitude of men were heard and the queen herself raised the tapestry hangings and put her finger on her lips	99.75309444823424
On seeing the queen the men stopped short respectfully	3073.925893776808
Enter gentlemen enter said the queen	773.8604082258149
There was then amongst that crowd a moments hesitation which looked like shame	336.72696158500855
They had expected resistance they had expected to be thwarted to have to force the gates to overturn the guards	109.37252529823117
The gates had opened of themselves and the king ostensibly at least had no other guard at his bedhead but his mother	301.51150137882706
The foremost of them stammered and attempted to fall back	177.89805065734052
Enter gentlemen said Laporte since the queen desires you so to do	157.35777809980087
Then one more bold than the rest ventured to pass the door and to advance on tiptoe	84.44684040019992
This example was imitated by the rest until the room filled silently as if these men had been the humblest most devoted courtiers	264.60707877199405
Far beyond the door the heads of those who were not able to enter could be seen all craning to their utmost height to try and see	154.20082846292004
DArtagnan saw it all through an opening he had made in the curtain and in the very first man who entered he recognized Planchet	188.23418757530416
Sir said the queen to him thinking he was the leader of the band you wished to see the king and therefore I determined to show him to you myself	91.84545687189296
Approach and look at him and say if we have the appearance of people who wish to run away	79.1848015278269
No certainly replied Planchet rather astonished at the unexpected honor conferred upon him	156.1112824800631
You will say then to my good and faithful Parisians continued Anne with a smile the expression of which did not deceive DArtagnan that you have seen the king in bed asleep and the queen also ready to retire	125.81682242481061
I shall tell them madame and those who accompany me will say the same thing but	56.05236857912782
But what asked Anne of Austria	6.717942537221964
Will your majesty pardon me said Planchet but is it really the king who is lying there	157.9839857651831
If she said there is one among you who knows the king let him approach and say whether it is really his majesty lying there	157.53258960290137
A man wrapped in a cloak in the folds of which his face was hidden approached and leaned over the bed and looked	46.58644907074725
For one second DArtagnan thought the man had some evil design and he put his hand to his sword but in the movement made by the man in stooping a portion of his face was uncovered and DArtagnan recognized the coadjutor	98.02613154197284
It is certainly the king said the man rising again	68.40843754247756
Yes repeated the leader in a whisper God bless his majesty and all these men who had entered enraged passed from anger to pity and blessed the royal infant in their turn	256.14291125263935
Now said Planchet let us thank the queen	476.44627813804004
They all bowed and retired by degrees as noiselessly as they had entered	106.20926970581371
Planchet who had been the first to enter was the last to leave	51.022427026246994
What is your name my friend she said	20.719676871199844
Planchet much surprised at the inquiry turned back	4720.72988946819
Yes continued the queen I think myself as much honored to have received you this evening as if you had been a prince and I wish to know your name	51.05191449143856
Yes thought Planchet to treat me as a prince	39.01990682586211
DArtagnan trembled lest Planchet seduced like the crow in the fable should tell his name and that the queen knowing his name would discover that Planchet had belonged to him	210.15626673507214
Madame replied Planchet respectfully I am called Dulaurier at your service	210.62457250642635
Thank you Monsieur Dulaurier said the queen and what is your business	52.6475601377984
Madame I am a clothier in the Rue Bourdonnais	124.82801383977059
That is all I wished to know said the queen	38.77233404023515
Much obliged to you Monsieur Dulaurier	758091.9123221714
You will hear again from me	17.88996021436365
Come come thought DArtagnan emerging from behind the curtain decidedly Monsieur Planchet is no fool it is evident he has been brought up in a good school	194.2230995219398
The different actors in this strange scene remained facing one another without uttering a single word the queen standing near the door DArtagnan half out of his hiding place the king raised on his elbow ready to fall down on his bed again at the slightest sound that would indicate the return of the multitude but instead of approaching the noise became more and more distant and very soon it died entirely away	132.12015812487846
DArtagnan wiped his damp forehead and the king slid off his bed saying Let us go	76.46847879252951
Well madame replied the valet I followed them as far as the gates	68.98436817931004
They announced to all their comrades that they had seen the king and that the queen had spoken to them and in fact they went away quite proud and happy	84.02335205766536
Oh the miserable wretches murmured the queen they shall pay dearly for their boldness and it is I who promise this	102.84803944496662
Then turning to DArtagnan she said	5.548997744250595
Sir you have given me this evening the best advice I have ever received	74.42904007616508
Continue and say what we must do now	64.68497065493943
Monsieur Laporte said DArtagnan finish dressing his majesty	1196.6922752724752
We may go then asked the queen	39.908624749759944
You have only to descend by the private stairs and you will find me at the door	44.44036627329572
Go sir said the queen I will follow you	17.587451541521116
DArtagnan went down and found the carriage at its post and the musketeer on the box	99.91878146670601
DArtagnan took out the parcel which he had desired Bernouin to place under the seat	119.71766311836319
It may be remembered that it was the hat and cloak belonging to Monsieur de Gondys coachman	306.40629199287014
He placed the cloak on his shoulders and the hat on his head whilst the musketeer got off the box	68.43003355106164
Sir said DArtagnan you will go and release your companion who is guarding the coachman	230.8743497232874
You must mount your horse and proceed to the Rue Tiquetonne Hotel de la Chevrette whence you will take my horse and that of Monsieur du Vallon which you must saddle and equip as if for war and then you will leave Paris bringing them with you to Cours la Reine	114.72347259199245
If when you arrive at Cours la Reine you find no one you must go on to Saint Germain	134.7412555364703
The musketeer touched his cap and went away to execute the orders thus received	128.0550893093931
DArtagnan mounted the box having a pair of pistols in his belt a musket under his feet and a naked sword behind him	54.40614946794689
The queen appeared and was followed by the king and the Duke dAnjou his brother	155.05132897304512
Monsieur the coadjutors carriage she exclaimed falling back	326.0706461590548
Yes madame said DArtagnan but get in fearlessly for I myself will drive you	756.2629401205959
The queen uttered a cry of surprise and entered the carriage and the king and monsieur took their places at her side	63.15672437937522
How madame said the valet in the same carriage as your majesties	114.09825553734258
It is not a matter of royal etiquette this evening but of the kings safety	320.70447334559174
Pull down the blinds said DArtagnan	2001.0991303857222
But will that not excite suspicion sir asked the queen	228.84240652797868
Your majestys mind may be quite at ease replied the officer I have my answer ready	210.35682701090897
The blinds were pulled down and they started at a gallop by the Rue Richelieu	60.72923721577249
On reaching the gate the captain of the post advanced at the head of a dozen men holding a lantern in his hand	50.35447995525233
DArtagnan signed to them to draw near	575.4173622700628
Do you recognize the carriage he asked the sergeant	115.47410730859616
The sergeant put the lantern near the panel	272.07368828435403
They are those of monsieur le coadjuteur he said	39.339446384934405
Hush he is enjoying a ride with Madame de Guemenee	345.73993170152573
I know who it is Then putting his face to the lowered blinds he said	249.95145591788906
I wish you joy my lord	167.91508168769823
Impudent fellow cried DArtagnan you will get me turned off	175.08881505061112
The gate groaned on its hinges and DArtagnan seeing the way clear whipped his horses who started at a canter and five minutes later they had rejoined the cardinal	244.14862386231928
Mousqueton exclaimed DArtagnan draw up the blinds of his majestys carriage	149.6381901899057
Disguised as a coachman exclaimed Mazarin	7740.427431141563
And driving the coadjutors carriage said the queen	73.307749768261
Corpo di Dio Monsieur dArtagnan said Mazarin you are worth your weight in gold	122.49124190396444
How DArtagnan and Porthos earned by selling Straw	2319.4623022788905
Mazarin was desirous of setting out instantly for Saint Germain but the queen declared that she should wait for the people whom she had appointed to meet her	117.6007919867645
However she offered the cardinal Laportes place which he accepted and went from one carriage to the other	216.45132383892695
It was not without foundation that a report of the kings intention to leave Paris by night had been circulated	131.094193549474
Ten or twelve persons had been in the secret since six oclock and howsoever great their prudence might be they could not issue the necessary orders for the departure without suspicion being generated	315.8146648255279
Besides each individual had one or two others for whom he was interested and as there could be no doubt but that the queen was leaving Paris full of terrible projects of vengeance every one had warned parents and friends of what was about to transpire so that the news of the approaching exit ran like a train of lighted gunpowder along the streets	163.96889188896222
The first carriage which arrived after that of the queen was that of the Prince de Cond with the princess and dowager princess	159.58919210938828
Both these ladies had been awakened in the middle of the night and did not know what it all was about	29.678432693590686
The second contained the Duke and Duchess of Orleans the tall young Mademoiselle and the Abb de la Riviere and the third the Duke de Longueville and the Prince de Conti brother and brotherinlaw of Cond	256.5410080861966
They all alighted and hastened to pay their respects to the king and queen in their coach	34.61563568965102
The queen fixed her eyes upon the carriage they had left and seeing that it was empty she said	54.317787584134685
But where is Madame de Longueville	1110.9459178814147
Ah yes where is my sister asked the prince	102.4891915496956
Madame de Longueville is ill said the duke and she desired me to excuse her to your majesty	61.899820867638205
Anne gave a quick glance to Mazarin who answered by an almost imperceptible shake of his head	182.77119410902557
What do you say of this asked the queen	67.72931910055642
I say that she is a hostage for the Parisians answered the cardinal	353.2637615374323
Why is she not come asked the prince in a low voice addressing his brother	42.292238416161446
Silence whispered the duke she has her reasons	386.18436371509813
She will ruin us returned the prince	70.00067445612586
She will save us said Conti	402812.7576795459
Carriages now arrived in crowds those of the Marechal de Villeroy Guitant Villequier and Comminges came into the line	358.25922274483065
The two musketeers arrived in their turn holding the horses of DArtagnan and Porthos in their hands	91.0599047892843
These two instantly mounted the coachman of the latter replacing DArtagnan on the coachbox of the royal coach	278.6690719622637
Mousqueton took the place of the coachman and drove standing for reasons known to himself like Automedon of antiquity	698.8755820628554
The queen though occupied by a thousand details tried to catch the Gascons eye but he with his wonted prudence had mingled with the crowd	183.97348493658316
Let us be the avant guard said he to Porthos and find good quarters at Saint Germain nobody will think of us and for my part I am greatly fatigued	217.72861190531785
As for me replied Porthos I am falling asleep which is strange considering we have not had any fighting truly the Parisians are idiots	365.6394242454915
Or rather we are very clever said DArtagnan	575.0161294573605
Better but do you think that we ve got them this time	90.56492715023333
You your command and I my title	1735.5228592950066
Ifaith yesI should expect so besides if they forget I shall take the liberty of reminding them	135.63193170373503
The queens voice she is speaking said Porthos I think she wants to ride on horseback	229.7942129426469
Oh she would like it but	65.21817512663065
The cardinal wo nt allow it	19.763652506042785
Gentlemen he said addressing the two musketeers accompany the royal carriage we are going forward to look for lodgings	350.6709235123428
DArtagnan started off for Saint Germain followed by Porthos	71.26536040903159
We will go on gentlemen said the queen	33.03960683952692
And the royal carriage drove on followed by the other coaches and about fifty horsemen	304.63682687894936
They reached Saint German without any accident on descending the queen found the prince awaiting her bareheaded to offer her his hand	249.7402362459794
What an awakening for the Parisians said the queen radiant	524.1037260715423
It is war said the prince	478.9284571893026
Well then let it be war Have we not on our side the conqueror of Rocroy of Nordlingen of Lens	493.6303879777233
It was then three oclock in the morning	2.8950846145274363
The queen walked first every one followed her	160.2228506969066
About two hundred persons had accompanied her in her flight	142.89422258066807
Gentlemen said the queen laughing pray take up your abode in the chateau it is large and there will be no want of room for you all but as we never thought of coming here I am informed that there are in all only three beds in the whole establishment one for the king one for me	132.9601185289814
And one for the cardinal muttered the prince	334.5808681694705
Am Iam I then to sleep on the floor asked Gaston dOrleans with a forced smile	284.8552074026116
No my prince replied Mazarin the third bed is intended for your highness	212.49466426334382
But your eminence replied the prince	1786.4583783756664
I answered Mazarin I shall not sleep at all I have work to do	51.67596436123996
Gaston desired that he should be shown into the room wherein he was to sleep without in the least concerning himself as to where his wife and daughter were to repose	122.1147327138533
Well for my part I shall go to bed said DArtagnan come Porthos	67.82690667480432
Porthos followed the lieutenant with that profound confidence he ever had in the wisdom of his friend	104.52383332697157
They walked from one end of the chateau to the other Porthos looking with wondering eyes at DArtagnan who was counting on his fingers	181.46008513255194
Four hundred at a pistole each four hundred pistoles	184.23781800542682
Yes interposed Porthos four hundred pistoles but who is to make four hundred pistoles	148.64468306684438
A pistole is not enough said DArtagnan tis worth a louis	401.32371907429837
Four hundred at a louis each make four hundred louis	107.42096637112141
Yes there are two hundred of them and each of them will need two which will make four hundred	94.72870439775102
But as there were all kinds of people about who were in a state of stupefaction at the unexpected arrival of the court he whispered in his friends ear	118.13871963770494
I understand answered Porthos I understand you perfectly on my honor two hundred louis each of us would be making a pretty thing of it but what will people say	118.1932436336808
Let them say what they will besides how will they know that we are doing it	114.79597624097467
But who will distribute these things asked Porthos	143.04385992277082
But he wears my livery my livery will be known replied Porthos	256.78309004785496
He can turn his coat inside out	1035.863750372393
You are always in the right my dear friend cried Porthos but where the devil do you discover all the notions you put into practice	171.01072541801227
The two friends turned down the first street they came to	67.89195885530232
Porthos knocked at the door of a house to the right whilst DArtagnan knocked at the door of a house to the left	54.37248950260131
Sir we do nt keep any was the reply of the people who opened the doors but please ask at the hay dealers	243.77587026095188
At the last large door in the street	20.075696825667308
Are there any other people in Saint Germain who sell straw	2308.017663476757
Yes there s the landlord of the Lamb and GrosLouis the farmer they both live in the Rue des Ursulines	210.80978318687238
DArtagnan went instantly to the hay dealer and bargained with him for a hundred and fifty trusses of straw which he obtained at the rate of three pistoles each	197.38914884283045
He went afterward to the innkeeper and bought from him two hundred trusses at the same price	173.3753904701965
Finally Farmer Louis sold them eighty trusses making in all four hundred and thirty	733.7970422735704
There was no more to be had in Saint Germain	170.09575232283044
This foraging did not occupy more than half an hour	16.598970843097526
Mousqueton duly instructed was put at the head of this sudden and new business	88.44987680568492
He was cautioned not to let a bit of straw out of his hands under a louis the truss and they intrusted to him straw to the amount of four hundred and thirty louis	137.22056778369668
DArtagnan taking with him three trusses of straw returned to the chateau where everybody freezing with cold and more than half asleep envied the king the queen and the Duke of Orleans on their camp beds	316.96630622328087
The lieutenants entrance produced a burst of laughter in the great drawingroom but he did not appear to notice that he was the object of general attention but began to arrange with so much cleverness nicety and gayety his straw bed that the mouths of all these poor creatures who could not go to sleep began to water	120.4312188292277
Straw they all cried out straw where is there any to be found	309.51334415526446
I can show you answered the Gascon	83.40246470039203
And he conducted them to Mousqueton who freely distributed the trusses at the rate of a louis apiece	436.207451204046
It was thought rather dear but people wanted to sleep and who would not give even two or three louis for a few hours of sound sleep	116.07884794967286
DArtagnan gave up his bed to any one who wanted it making it over about a dozen times and since he was supposed to have paid like the others a louis for his truss of straw he pocketed in that way thirty louis in less than half an hour	130.75509458965348
At five oclock in the morning the straw was worth eighty francs a truss and there was no more to be had	89.4245329262913
DArtagnan had taken the precaution to set apart four trusses for his own use	403.6982653485511
He put in his pocket the key of the room where he had hidden them and accompanied by Porthos returned to settle with Mousqueton who naively and like the worthy steward that he was handed them four hundred and thirty louis and kept one hundred for himself	139.85325633659673
Mousqueton who knew nothing of what was going on in the chateau wondered that the idea had not occurred to him sooner	115.69999125645
DArtagnan put the gold in his hat and in going back to the chateau settled the reckoning with Porthos each of them had cleared two hundred and fifteen louis	144.55079413243567
Porthos however found that he had no straw left for himself	165.20379622710016
He returned to Mousqueton but the steward had sold the last wisp	213.99911699348146
He then repaired to DArtagnan who thanks to his four trusses of straw was in the act of making up and tasting by anticipation the luxury of a bed so soft so well stuffed at the head so well covered at the foot that it would have excited the envy of the king himself if his majesty had not been fast asleep in his own	131.53400164876342
DArtagnan could on no account consent to pull his bed to pieces again for Porthos but for a consideration of four louis that the latter paid him for it he consented that Porthos should share his couch with him	215.4975824992113
He laid his sword at the head his pistols by his side stretched his cloak over his feet placed his felt hat on the top of his cloak and extended himself luxuriously on the straw which rustled under him	95.61549926839162
He was already enjoying the sweet dream engendered by the possession of two hundred and nineteen louis made in a quarter of an hour when a voice was heard at the door of the hall which made him stir	60.412067070028456
Porthos foresaw that if DArtagnan was called away he should remain the sole possessor of the bed	109.49173462115988
I am come to fetch you Monsieur dArtagnan	176.77071261222756
Tell my lord that I m going to sleep and I advise him as a friend to do the same	35.18008982621942
His eminence is not gone to bed and will not go to bed and wants you instantly	31.517817781596918
The devil take Mazarin who does not know when to sleep at the proper time	66.92827686127016
What does he want with me Is it to make me a captain In that case I will forgive him	58.15581399695301
And the musketeer rose grumbling took his sword hat pistols and cloak and followed the officer whilst Porthos alone and sole possessor of the bed endeavored to follow the good example of falling asleep which his predecessor had set him	275.68364904404
Monsieur dArtagnan said the cardinal on perceiving him I have not forgotten with what zeal you have served me	72.30098470141172
I am going to prove to you that I have not	11.343746145158034
Good thought the Gascon this is a promising beginning	227.40219452406367
Monsieur dArtagnan he resumed do you wish to become a captain	39.14990966391918
And your friend still longs to be made a baron	38.18930395530991
At this very moment my lord he no doubt dreams that he is one already	183.6438169446263
Then said Mazarin taking from his portfolio the letter which he had already shown DArtagnan take this dispatch and carry it to England	200.79874052796956
DArtagnan looked at the envelope there was no address on it	80.95608696895678
Am I not to know to whom to present it	180.85831728345957
You will know when you reach London at London you may tear off the outer envelope	745.089531832768
To obey in every particular the man to whom this letter is addressed	45.844634346141696
You must set out for Boulogne	24223.59126663595
At the Royal Arms of England you will find a young gentleman named Mordaunt	168.06085561623
Yes my lord and what am I to do with this young gentleman	36.23642806663641
DArtagnan looked at the cardinal with a stupefied air	44.100321617846674
There are your instructions said Mazarin go	3237.382736365965
Go tis easy to say so but that requires money and I have nt any	141.50784684064462
Ah replied Mazarin so you have no money	72.07405026252927
But the diamond I gave you yesterday	70.89429306708665
I wish to keep it in remembrance of your eminence	166.03152532515082
Tis very dear living in England my lord especially as envoy extraordinary	967.736800541056
Zounds replied Mazarin the people there are very sedate and their habits since the revolution simple but no matter	379.7651580118237
He opened a drawer and took out a purse	66.27266775835089
What do you say to a thousand crowns	261.7095525740483
DArtagnan pouted out his lower lip in a most extraordinary manner	73.62683765164418
I reply my lord tis but little as certainly I shall not go alone	75.81967540767617
Monsieur du Vallon that worthy gentleman for with the exception of yourself Monsieur dArtagnan there s not a man in France that I esteem and love so much as him	117.72122229408541
Then my lord replied DArtagnan pointing to the purse which Mazarin still held if you love and esteem him so much youunderstand me	173.35886406858225
Be it so on his account I add two hundred crowns	75.46642320403494
But on our return he said aloud may we that is my friend and I depend on having he his barony and I my promotion	266.64113224252054
I should like another sort of oath better said DArtagnan to himself then aloud May I not offer my duty to her majesty the queen	235.42397617963755
Her majesty is asleep and you must set off directly replied Mazarin go pray sir	296.46457056809334
One word more my lord if there s any fighting where I m going must I fight	307.2411761452395
You are to obey the commands of the personage to whom I have addressed the inclosed letter	121.99078166764663
Tis well said DArtagnan holding out his hand to receive the money	13.060035150193029
I offer my best respects and services to you my lord	75.96362402721309
DArtagnan then returning to the officer said	272.03644612192556
Sir have the kindness also to awaken Monsieur du Vallon and to say tis by his eminences order and that I shall await him at the stables	183.68551986265072
The officer went off with an eagerness that showed the Gascon that he had some personal interest in the matter	99.52621284607086
Porthos was snoring most musically when some one touched him on the shoulder	85.92702788517339
I come from the cardinal said the officer	75.92916634661545
Heigho said Porthos opening his large eyes what have you got to say	146.33228896647825
That his eminence has ordered you to England and that Monsieur dArtagnan is waiting for you in the stables	75.79649894488638
Porthos sighed heavily arose took his hat his pistols and his cloak and departed casting a look of regret upon the couch where he had hoped to sleep so well	64.02161067189336
No sooner had he turned his back than the officer laid himself down in it and he had scarcely crossed the threshold before his successor in his turn was snoring immoderately	226.6782539520254
It was very natural he being the only person in the whole assemblage except the king the queen and the Duke of Orleans who slept gratuitously	231.8484264604999
In which we hear Tidings of Aramis	291.3533942025737
DArtagnan went straight to the stables day was just dawning	3442.451402619178
He found his horse and that of Porthos fastened to the manger but to an empty manger	423.0344433772347
He took pity on these poor animals and went to a corner of the stable where he saw a little straw but in doing so he struck his foot against a human body which uttered a cry and arose on its knees rubbing its eyes	107.46303100134709
It was Mousqueton who having no straw to lie upon had helped himself to that of the horses	245.10912938359058
Mousqueton cried DArtagnan let us be off Let us set off	231.65404588365737
Mousqueton recognizing the voice of his masters friend got up suddenly and in doing so let fall some louis which he had appropriated to himself illegally during the night	223.22996578380122
Ho ho exclaimed DArtagnan picking up a louis and displaying it heres a louis that smells confoundedly of straw	776.0586453559251
Mousqueton blushed so confusedly that the Gascon began to laugh at him and said	45.891184386664754
Porthos would be angry my dear Monsieur Mousqueton but I pardon you only let us remember that this gold must serve us as a joke so be gaycome along	224.26197010910957
Mousqueton instantly assumed a jovial countenance saddled the horses quickly and mounted his own without making faces over it	395.5052391513391
Whilst this went on Porthos arrived with a very cross look on his face and was astonished to find the lieutenant resigned and Mousqueton almost merry	167.49303044668758
Ah that s it he cried you have your promotion and I my barony	137.8082956460042
We are going to fetch our brevets said DArtagnan and when we come back Master Mazarin will sign them	409.3520523681244
And where are we going asked Porthos	392.8624231235058
To Paris first I have affairs to settle	641.7903487482173
And they both set out for Paris	46.15779353522543
On arriving at its gates they were astounded to see the threatening aspect of the capital	106.7746513560727
Around a brokendown carriage the people were uttering imprecations whilst the persons who had attempted to escape were made prisonersthat is to say an old man and two women	266.0106067111498
On the other hand as the two friends approached to enter they showed them every kind of civility thinking them deserters from the royal party and wishing to bind them to their own	234.18804223486472
What is the king doing they asked	579.9219824006165
He is awake so keep on the watch as they are gone away its for some purpose rely on it	91.19320933772715
But as you are the strongest after all continued DArtagnan do nt be furious with old men and women and keep your wrath for more appropriate occasions	662.476729595516
The people listened to these words and let go the ladies who thanked DArtagnan with an eloquent look	144.48166976254674
And they continued their way crossing the barricades getting the chains about their legs pushed about questioning and questioned	1679.9978763288877
In the place of the Palais Royal DArtagnan saw a sergeant who was drilling six or seven hundred citizens	463.91488316598
It was Planchet who brought into play profitably the recollections of the regiment of Piedmont	474.416484758218
In passing before DArtagnan he recognized his former master	352.18537718309847
Goodday Monsieur dArtagnan said Planchet proudly	947.7418049809747
Planchet stopped short staring at DArtagnan	33265.727565053836
The first row seeing their sergeant stop stopped in their turn and so on to the very last	265.4169686386791
These citizens are dreadfully ridiculous observed DArtagnan to Porthos and went on his way	166.29289199125304
Five minutes afterward he entered the hotel of La Chevrette where pretty Madeleine the hostess came to him	199.88439157852207
My dear Mistress Turquaine said the Gascon if you happen to have any money lock it up quickly if you happen to have any jewels hide them directly if you happen to have any debtors make them pay you or any creditors do nt pay them	120.62033865555101
Because Paris is going to be reduced to dust and ashes like Babylon of which you have no doubt heard tell	257.05596875483735
And are you going to leave me at such a time	36.34925622535184
Ah if you could tell me that you would be doing me a service	39.65922942938059
Have you any letters for me inquired DArtagnan wishing to signify to the hostess that her lamentations were superfluous and that therefore she had better spare him demonstrations of her grief	312.79366328723444
There s one just arrived and she handed the letter to DArtagnan	122.70915226110507
From Athos cried DArtagnan recognizing the handwriting	718.1770062002525
Ah said Porthos let us hear what he says	41.72407609998872
DArtagnan opened the letter and read as follows	65.52937104582946
Dear DArtagnan dear Du Vallon my good friends perhaps this may be the last time that you will ever hear from me	78.44303117463484
Aramis and I are very unhappy but God our courage and the remembrance of our friendship sustain us	210.33283303010919
I intrust to you certain papers which are at Blois and in two months and a half if you do not hear of us take possession of them	67.74778036531146
Embrace with all your heart the vicomte for your devoted friend	530.6220077032892
I believe by Heaven said DArtagnan that I shall embrace him since he s upon our road and if he is so unfortunate as to lose our dear Athos from that very day he becomes my son	141.28232812500286
And I said Porthos shall make him my sole heir	140.9123472359959
Let us see what more does Athos say	4399.883785117082
Should you meet on your journey a certain Monsieur Mordaunt distrust him in a letter I can not say more	216.90890937984665
Monsieur Mordaunt exclaimed the Gascon surprised	504.85670438416565
Monsieur Mordaunt tis well said Porthos we shall remember that but see there is a postscript from Aramis	164.11986455671612
So there is said DArtagnan and he read	69.39733420846962
We conceal the place where we are dear friends knowing your brotherly affection and that you would come and die with us were we to reveal it	119.62638331077892
Confound it interrupted Porthos with an explosion of passion which sent Mousqueton to the other end of the room are they in danger of dying	79.20099442060494
Athos bequeaths to you Raoul and I bequeath to you my revenge	61.25060220615029
If by any good luck you lay your hand on a certain man named Mordaunt tell Porthos to take him into a corner and to wring his neck	117.62723560443462
I dare not say more in a letter	55.14376718777527
If that is all it is easily done said Porthos	128.9436302154241
On the contrary observed DArtagnan with a vexed look it would be impossible	48.211108084217095
It is precisely this Monsieur Mordaunt whom we are going to join at Boulogne and with whom we cross to England	113.9486876647634
Well suppose instead of joining this Monsieur Mordaunt we were to go and join our friends said Porthos with a gesture fierce enough to have frightened an army	168.7410294290609
I did think of it but this letter has neither date nor postmark	921.3082464924648
And he began to wander about the room like a man beside himself gesticulating and half drawing his sword out of the scabbard	143.79817731943396
As to DArtagnan he remained standing like a man in consternation with the deepest affliction depicted on his face	137.94296772206977
Ah this is not right Athos insults us he wishes to die alone it is bad bad bad	383.2072548106941
Mousqueton witnessing this despair melted into tears in a corner of the room	17.428280847310393
Come said DArtagnan all this leads to nothing	849.5682228669604
We will embrace Raoul and perhaps he will have news of Athos	235.37159328547145
Stopan idea cried Porthos indeed my dear DArtagnan I do nt know how you manage but you are always full of ideas let us go and embrace Raoul	98.7338845206258
Woe to that man who should happen to contradict my master at this moment said Mousqueton to himself I would nt give a farthing for his life	101.36834821475529
On arriving at the Rue Saint Denis the friends found a vast concourse of people	258.7375291756653
It was the Duc de Beaufort who was coming from the Vendomois and whom the coadjutor was showing to the Parisians intoxicated with joy	118.68254062459259
With the dukes aid they already considered themselves invincible	2161.839614958428
The two friends turned off into a side street to avoid meeting the prince and so reached the Saint Denis gate	292.0373378670124
Is it true said the guard to the two cavaliers that the Duc de Beaufort has arrived in Paris	83.54476758331805
Nothing more certain and the best proof of it is said DArtagnan that he has dispatched us to meet the Duc de Vendome his father who is coming in his turn	64.90445605533668
Long live De Beaufort cried the guards and they drew back respectfully to let the two friends pass	79.75459995778017
Once across the barriers these two knew neither fatigue nor fear	912.3716972112935
Their horses flew and they never ceased speaking of Athos and Aramis	220.85309215754518
The camp had entered Saint Omer the friends made a little detour and went to the camp and gave the army an exact account of the flight of the king and queen	140.30772351859162
They found Raoul near his tent reclining on a truss of hay of which his horse stole some mouthfuls the young mans eyes were red and he seemed dejected	251.36064063385913
The Marechal de Grammont and the Comte de Guiche had returned to Paris and he was quite lonely	69.08895361765344
And as soon as he saw the two cavaliers he ran to them with open arms	70.1514977827462
Oh is it you dear friends Did you come here to fetch me Will you take me away with you Do you bring me tidings of my guardian	104.72683367006915
Have you not received any said DArtagnan to the youth	213.2229797469368
Alas sir no and I do not know what has become of him so that I am really so unhappy that I weep	38.4027458994287
In fact tears rolled down his cheeks	2.815065703740417
Porthos turned aside in order not to show by his honest round face what was passing in his mind	99.70808273985436
Deuce take it cried DArtagnan more moved than he had been for a long time do nt despair my friend if you have not received any letters from the count we have received one	63.80051238041709
And a comforting one too added DArtagnan seeing the delight that his intelligence gave the young man	195.09118000921245
Yesthat is I had it repined the Gascon making believe to find it	850.7955576112082
Wait it ought to be there in my pocket it speaks of his return does it not Porthos	227.63162737703053
All Gascon as he was DArtagnan could not bear alone the weight of that falsehood	210.65298991981862
Eh give it to me said the young man	6.835062305927774
Eh I read it a little while since	199.80832117673359
Can I have lost it Ah confound it yes my pocket has a hole in it	207.85883738359215
Oh yes Monsieur Raoul said Mousqueton the letter was very consoling	635.4955127409734
These gentlemen read it to me and I wept for joy	56.5784235333399
But at any rate you know where he is Monsieur dArtagnan asked Raoul somewhat comforted	354.63454672157604
Ah that s the thing replied the Gascon	112.98971416572228
Undoubtedly I know it but it is a mystery	38.946796576987865
No not to you so I am going to tell you where he is	12.158948758000824
Porthos devoured DArtagnan with wondering eyes	152.5738054207788
Where the devil shall I say that he is so that he can not try to rejoin him thought DArtagnan	104.19008266469294
Well where is he sir asked Raoul in a soft and coaxing voice	253.660354138456
Among the Turks exclaimed Raoul alarmed	5857.5156524815075
Good heavens how can you tell me that	11.27641939881329
Does that alarm you cried DArtagnan	2906.4815624059456
Pooh what are the Turks to such men as the Comte de la Fere and the Abb dHerblay	47.866669527428435
Ah his friend is with him said Raoul	405.45567518100216
Has he wit or notthis demon DArtagnan said Porthos astonished at his friends deception	869.1078340465608
Now sir said DArtagnan wishing to change the conversation here are fifty pistoles that the count has sent you by the same courier	91.20266277329435
I suppose you have no more money and that they will be welcome	52.55028180993723
I have still twenty pistoles sir	829.42974541956
Well take them that makes seventy	801246.2193176606
And if you wish for more said Porthos putting his hand to his pocket	77.83165119329041
Thank you sir replied Raoul blushing thank you a thousand times	83.47062082014195
Apropos said DArtagnan loud enough for the servant to hear him are you satisfied with Olivain	84.1802904512427
Yes in some respects tolerably well	385.3154933096113
Olivain pretended to have heard nothing and entered the tent	275.17472211105354
What fault do you find with the fellow	159.0070067549348
Oh sir cried Olivain reappearing at this accusation	243.57306500291844
And a little bit of a thief	369.60661121875717
And more especially a notorious coward	5245.352937473397
Oh oh sir you really vilify me cried Olivain	2984.9132099981825
Pray learn Monsieur Olivain that people like us are not to be served by cowards	155.81539992631883
Rob your master eat his sweetmeats and drink his wine but by Jove do nt be a coward or I shall cut off your ears	173.34144856804025
Look at Monsieur Mouston see the honorable wounds he has received observe how his habitual valor has given dignity to his countenance	357.2535466900337
Mousqueton was in the third heaven and would have embraced DArtagnan had he dared meanwhile he resolved to sacrifice his life for him on the next occasion that presented itself	200.57009045748816
Send away that fellow Raoul said the Gascon for if he s a coward he will disgrace thee some day	247.6324281048119
Monsieur says I am coward cried Olivain because he wanted the other day to fight a cornet in Grammonts regiment and I refused to accompany him	330.3936145130982
Monsieur Olivain a lackey ought never to disobey said DArtagnan sternly then taking him aside he whispered to him Thou hast done right thy master was in the wrong heres a crown for thee but should he ever be insulted and thou dost not let thyself be cut in quarters for him I will cut out thy tongue	367.19779829512515
Olivain bowed and slipped the crown into his pocket	125.30104884773462
And now Raoul said the Gascon Monsieur du Vallon and I are going away as ambassadors where I know not but should you want anything write to Madame Turquaine at La Chevrette Rue Tiquetonne and draw upon her purse as on a bankerwith economy for it is not so well filled as that of Monsieur dEmery	267.4828495699796
And having meantime embraced his ward he passed him into the robust arms of Porthos who lifted him up from the ground and held him a moment suspended near the noble heart of the formidable giant	103.4515467665911
Come said DArtagnan let us go	6.294008687118922
And they set out for Boulogne where toward evening they arrived their horses flecked with foam and dark with perspiration	465.89335712527685
At ten steps from the place where they halted was a young man in black who seemed waiting for some one and who from the moment he saw them enter the town never took his eyes off them	113.13149750686514
DArtagnan approached him and seeing him stare so fixedly said	671.5684653960186
Well friend I do nt like people to quiz me	920.9965894559061
Sir said the young man do you not come from Paris if you please	15.84990957205398
DArtagnan thought it was some gossip who wanted news from the capital	573.5288847513108
Yes sir he said in a softened tone	122.83745104481162
Are you not going to put up at the Arms of England	108.09549208419541
Are you not charged with a mission from his eminence Cardinal Mazarin	455.3880353946481
In that case I am the man you have to do with	37.15336269748214
Ah thought DArtagnan the man I am warned against by Athos	325.76237927401917
Ah thought Porthos the man Aramis wants me to strangle	877.2913602033937
They both looked searchingly at the young man who misunderstood the meaning of that inquisition	97.09199627510922
Do you doubt my word he said	12.582359124906707
In that case I can give you proofs	159.28083403740132
No sir said DArtagnan and we place ourselves at your orders	211.26513939205958
Well gentlemen resumed Mordaunt we must set out without delay today is the last day granted me by the cardinal	99.21605027495748
My ship is ready and had you not come I must have set off without you for General Cromwell expects my return impatiently	333.56654738554437
So thought the lieutenant tis to General Cromwell that our dispatches are addressed	495.3087697353139
Have you no letter for him asked the young man	7.922772308423545
I have one the seal of which I am not to break till I reach London but since you tell me to whom it is addressed tis useless to wait till then	66.8109342969362
DArtagnan tore open the envelope of the letter	11.617665961967257
It was directed to Monsieur Oliver Cromwell General of the Army of the English Nation	832.0981138967849
Ah said DArtagnan a singular commission	6592.423910564433
Who is this Monsieur Oliver Cromwell inquired Porthos	3603.956493010275
Formerly a brewer replied the Gascon	1855.011565358663
Perhaps Mazarin wishes to make a speculation in beer as we did in straw said Porthos	474.9668162261944
Come come gentlemen said Mordaunt impatiently let us depart	195.00927603246674
What exclaimed Porthos without supper Can not Monsieur Cromwell wait a little	977.5162763459031
Well you said Porthos what then	2758.0609917874053
Oh as to you that is not my concern and I shall sup either with or without your permission	188.41897537654455
The young mans eyes kindled in secret but he restrained himself	138.1237493921065
Monsieur said DArtagnan you must excuse famished travelers	30005.20717733036
Besides our supper ca nt delay you much	53.673042387191906
We will hasten on to the inn you will meanwhile proceed on foot to the harbor	111.90620637081533
We will take a bite and shall be there as soon as you are	26.651679419106525
Just as you please gentlemen provided we set sail he said	498.21832810243865
The name of your ship inquired DArtagnan	973.7406552317342
Very well in half an hour we shall be on board	17.747337361630347
And the friends spurring on their horses rode to the hotel the Arms of England	130.47177975050957
What do you say of that young man asked DArtagnan as they hurried along	175.6619027958289
I say that he does nt suit me at all said Porthos and that I feel a strong itching to follow Aramiss advice	278.5415699240456
By no means my dear Porthos that man is a messenger of General Cromwell it would insure for us a poor reception I imagine should it be announced to him that we had twisted the neck of his confidant	200.69562966356236
Nevertheless said Porthos I have always noticed that Aramis gives good advice	504.748918450373
Listen returned DArtagnan when our embassy is finished	905.3045514974137
If it brings us back to France	33.938852565745016
At that moment the two friends reached the hotel Arms of England where they supped with hearty appetite and then at once proceeded to the port	160.7666622765893
There they found a brig ready to set sail upon the deck of which they recognized Mordaunt walking up and down impatiently	166.41521342335128
It is singular said DArtagnan whilst the boat was taking them to the Standard it is astonishing how that young man resembles some one I must have known but who it was I can not yet remember	183.80540191814995
A few minutes later they were on board but the embarkation of the horses was a longer matter than that of the men and it was eight oclock before they raised anchor	98.57854552910065
The young man stamped impatiently and ordered all sail to be spread	171.33901926136113
Porthos completely used up by three nights without sleep and a journey of seventy leagues on horseback retired to his cabin and went to sleep	116.70983402275984
DArtagnan overcoming his repugnance to Mordaunt walked with him upon the deck and invented a hundred stories to make him talk	221.76625038885294
And now our readers must leave the Standard to sail peaceably not toward London where DArtagnan and Porthos believed they were going but to Durham whither Mordaunt had been ordered to repair by the letter he had received during his sojourn at Boulogne and accompany us to the royalist camp on this side of the Tyne near Newcastle	345.77791170905385
There placed between two rivers on the borders of Scotland but still on English soil the tents of a little army extended	305.70138328545426
Some Highlanders were listlessly keeping watch	1740.7385271363669
The moon which was partially obscured by heavy clouds now and then lit up the muskets of the sentinels or silvered the walls the roofs and the spires of the town that Charles I	186.73485393424585
had just surrendered to the parliamentary troops whilst Oxford and Newark still held out for him in the hopes of coming to some arrangement	438.5172308456329
At one of the extremities of the camp near an immense tent in which the Scottish officers were holding a kind of council presided over by Lord Leven their commander a man attired as a cavalier lay sleeping on the turf his right hand extended over his sword	283.9283875362368
About fifty paces off another man also appareled as a cavalier was talking to a Scotch sentinel and though a foreigner he seemed to understand without much difficulty the answers given in the broad Perthshire dialect	461.84659515518507
As the town clock of Newcastle struck one the sleeper awoke and with all the gestures of a man rousing himself out of deep sleep he looked attentively about him perceiving that he was alone he rose and making a little circuit passed close to the cavalier who was speaking to the sentinel	138.0406440479805
The former had no doubt finished his questions for a moment later he said goodnight and carelessly followed the same path taken by the first cavalier	191.1946021311444
In the shadow of a tent the former was awaiting him	432.6895244640306
Well my dear friend said he in as pure French as has ever been uttered between Rouen and Tours	485.520536684886
Well my friend there is not a moment to lose we must let the king know immediately	151.6415484579075
It would take too long to tell you besides you will hear it all directly and the least word dropped here might ruin all	144.89196570368824
We must go and find Lord Winter	3647.668590399139
They both set off to the other end of the camp but as it did not cover more than a surface of five hundred feet they quickly arrived at the tent they were looking for	71.54639831286111
Tony is your master sleeping said one of the two cavaliers to a servant who was lying in the outer compartment which served as a kind of anteroom	87.66887663525002
No monsieur le comte answered the servant I think not or at least he has not long been so for he was pacing up and down for more than two hours after he left the king and the sound of his footsteps has only ceased during the last ten minutes	55.4800141452305
However you may look and see added the lackey raising the curtained entrance of the tent	262.5521905172785
Lord Winter was seated near an aperture arranged as a window to let in the night air his eyes mechanically following the course of the moon intermittently veiled as we before observed by heavy clouds	250.05650705048075
The two friends approached Winter who with his head on his hands was gazing at the heavens he did not hear them enter and remained in the same attitude till he felt a hand upon his shoulder	55.19733515230737
He turned around recognized Athos and Aramis and held out his hand to them	18.2070892377665
Have you observed said he to them what a bloodred color the moon has tonight	800.2981154139642
No replied Athos I thought it looked much the same as usual	185.5874005085823
Look again chevalier returned Lord Winter	2308.289881878562
I must own said Aramis I am like the Comte de la FereI can see nothing remarkable about it	81.86497691148762
My lord said Athos in a position so precarious as ours we must examine the earth and not the heavens	224.8929580503169
Have you studied our Scotch troops and have you confidence in them	226.69268557769388
Those in whom the king has confidedLord Levens Highlanders	36305.778551525764
No said Winter then he paused but tell me can you not perceive the russet tint which marks the heavens	230.50790987894757
Not the least in the world said Aramis and Athos at once	160.27606318146485
Tell me continued Winter always possessed by the same idea is there not a tradition in France that Henry IV	153.81374676527838
the evening before the day he was assassinated when he was playing at chess with M	103.77653606762543
de Bassompiere saw clots of blood upon the chessboard	306.78435948296845
Yes said Athos and the marechal has often told me so himself	477.7922651713591
Then it was so murmured Winter and the next day Henry IV	311.6992066883076
But what has this vision of Henry IV	149.18201336604508
to do with you my lord inquired Aramis	596.3000445686034
Nothing and indeed I am mad to trouble you with such things when your coming to my tent at such an hour announces that you are the bearers of important news	152.53666978078164
Yes my lord said Athos I wish to speak to the king	18.342185610984
To the king but the king is asleep	194.56152876925526
I have something important to reveal to him	103.4623728136296
Can it not be put off till tomorrow	58.004982622072234
He must know it this moment and perhaps it is already too late	80.17564062338714
Lord Winters tent was pitched by the side of the royal marquee a kind of corridor communicating between the two	115.64120993777334
This corridor was guarded not by a sentinel but by a confidential servant through whom in case of urgency Charles could communicate instantly with his faithful subject	548.5420188826038
These gentlemen are with me said Winter	1033.024908938007
The lackey bowed and let them pass	15.877818871163555
As he had said on a camp bed dressed in his black doublet booted unbelted with his felt hat beside him lay the king overcome by sleep and fatigue	447.4134253209912
They advanced and Athos who was the first to enter gazed a moment in silence on that pale and noble face framed in its long and now untidy matted hair the blue veins showing through the transparent temples his eyes seemingly swollen by tears	293.9704752923604
Athos sighed deeply the sigh woke the king so lightly did he sleep	642.7807669037876
Ah said he raising himself on his elbow is it you Comte de la Fere	71.08628457542491
You watch while I sleep and you have come to bring me some news	41.99578819245278
Alas sire answered Athos your majesty has guessed aright	673.7527199049189
Never mind the messenger is welcome	4724.9727155749915
You never come to me without conferring pleasure	4799.364189346903
You whose devotion recognizes neither country nor misfortune you who are sent to me by Henrietta whatever news you bring speak out	271.97869095219335
Sire Cromwell has arrived this night at Newcastle	542.9250718065281
Ah exclaimed the king to fight	151.58944721090012
No sire but to buy your majesty	183.57093964260662
I said sire that four hundred thousand pounds are owing to the Scottish army	89.06122251221574
For unpaid wages yes I know it	38.51120966097175
For the last year my faithful Highlanders have fought for honor alone	1770.0419741085293
Well sir though honor is a fine thing they are tired of fighting for it and tonight they have sold you for two hundred thousand poundsthat is to say for half what is owing them	134.12744992743637
Impossible cried the king the Scotch sell their king for two hundred thousand pounds And who is the Judas who has concluded this infamous bargain	376.2915725553328
Are you certain of it sir	131.26081503850165
I heard it with my own ears	92.79427055579814
The king sighed deeply as if his heart would break and then buried his face in his hands	37.18958841267294
Oh the Scotch he exclaimed the Scotch I called my faithful to whom I trusted myself when I could have fled to Oxford the Scotch my brothers But are you well assured sir	316.96812121112936
Lying behind the tent of Lord Leven I raised it and saw all heard all	282.07938799769227
And when is this to be consummated	204.9437004770324
Todaythis morning so your majesty must perceive there is no time to lose	46.04889757760774
To do what since you say I am sold	78.5159004634261
To cross the Tyne reach Scotland and rejoin Lord Montrose who will not sell you	557.6305116488093
And what shall I do in Scotland A war of partisans unworthy of a king	779.5678175124383
The example of Robert Bruce will absolve you sire	1906.5465386211158
No no I have fought too long they have sold me they shall give me up and the eternal shame of treble treason shall fall on their heads	105.01410862650576
Sire said Athos perhaps a king should act thus but not a husband and a father	207.33064197329801
I have come in the name of your wife and daughter and of the children you have still in London and I say to you Live sireit is the will of Heaven	97.29068907170058
The king raised himself buckled on his belt and passing his handkerchief over his moist forehead said	73.80032060018368
Well what is to be done	17.642369949098097
Sire have you in the army one regiment on which you can implicitly rely	518.3141382344659
Winter said the king do you believe in the fidelity of yours	44.424547494890206
Sire they are but men and men are become both weak and wicked	236.24074929805096
I will not answer for them	66.6674644681333
I would confide my life to them but I should hesitate ere I trusted them with your majestys	207.0318540747442
Well said Athos since you have not a regiment we are three devoted men	105.47922312695589
Let your majesty mount on horseback and place yourself in the midst of us we will cross the Tyne reach Scotland and you will be saved	108.87808289267234
Is this your counsel also Winter inquired the king	857.8589411932319
Winter then left the tent in the meantime the king finished his toilet	177.5339704280886
The first rays of daybreak penetrated the aperture of the tent as Winter reentered it	480.211227064508
All is ready sire said he	15.930263470817922
Grimaud and Blaisois are holding your horses ready saddled	833.0282009700635
In that case exclaimed Athos let us not lose an instant but set off	46.73890401711076
Sire said Aramis will not your majesty acquaint some of your friends of this	148.44712420164623
Friends answered Charles sadly I have but threeone of twenty years who has never forgotten me and two of a weeks standing whom I shall never forget	113.36614244842553
The king quitted his tent and found his horse ready waiting for him	72.84143297699951
It was a chestnut that the king had ridden for three years and of which he was very fond	72.45342970569756
The horse neighed with pleasure at seeing him	34.1123263121667
Ah said the king I was unjust here is a creature that loves me	158.38649403521288
You at least will be faithful to me Arthur	460.4527683737615
The horse as if it understood these words bent its red nostrils toward the kings face and parting his lips displayed all its teeth as if with pleasure	239.62003581518897
Yes yes said the king caressing it with his hand yes my Arthur thou art a fond and faithful creature	535.9266971416906
After this little scene Charles threw himself into the saddle and turning to Athos Aramis and Winter said	178.80040237828769
Now gentlemen I am at your service	14.513174384309263
But Athos was standing with his eyes fixed on a black line which bordered the banks of the Tyne and seemed to extend double the length of the camp	75.51703863412888
What is that line cried Athos whose vision was still rather obscured by the uncertain shades and demitints of daybreak	429.2704169964656
What is that line I did not observe it yesterday	127.61231257486273
It must be the fog rising from the river said the king	94.15593335666618
Sire it is something more opaque than the fog	319.16213619130315
Indeed said Winter it appears to me like a bar of red color	66.1628772331802
It is the enemy who have made a sortie from Newcastle and are surrounding us exclaimed Athos	440.72202642682987
Stop a moment does not that sunbeam yonder just by the side of the town glitter on the Ironsides	388.53613334157
This was the name given the cuirassiers whom Cromwell had made his bodyguard	631.6481148171531
Ah said the king we shall soon see whether my Highlanders have betrayed me or not	113.32365777468422
What are you going to do exclaimed Athos	437.7816685366012
To give them the order to charge and run down these miserable rebels	685.9787532920749
And the king putting spurs to his horse set off to the tent of Lord Leven	113.14621551897254
Is the king wounded cried Lord Winter	3266.993598125568
I see spots of blood on the ground	17.616462600701606
And he set off to follow the two friends	90.20408537740565
Go and call out your regiment said he I can foresee that we shall have need of it directly	112.51233644108626
Winter turned his horse and the two friends rode on	78.45915738433841
It had taken but two minutes for the king to reach the tent of the Scottish commander he dismounted and entered	146.33779325019663
The general was there surrounded by the more prominent chiefs	760.5480431385615
The king they exclaimed as all rose in bewilderment	1706.4149651863218
Charles was indeed in the midst of them his hat on his head his brows bent striking his boot with his riding whip	116.084104228166
Yes gentlemen the king in person the king who has come to ask for some account of what has happened	42.766080801950196
What is the matter sire exclaimed Lord Leven	2283.9325120880967
It is this sir said the king angrily that General Cromwell has reached Newcastle that you knew it and I was not informed of it that the enemy have left the town and are now closing the passages of the Tyne against us that our sentinels have seen this movement and I have been left unacquainted with it that by an infamous treaty you have sold me for two hundred thousand pounds to Parliament	158.79063973983762
Of this treaty at least I have been warned	29.34361106733293
This is the matter gentlemen answer and exculpate yourselves for I stand here to accuse you	410.9420115098184
Sire said Lord Leven with hesitation sire your majesty has been deceived by false reports	177.01794953892272
My own eyes have seen the enemy extend itself between myself and Scotland and I can almost say that with my own ears I have heard the clauses of the treaty debated	200.7343610050337
The Scotch chieftains looked at each other in their turn with frowning brows	90.44510749830084
Sire murmured Lord Leven crushed by shame sire we are ready to give you every proof of our fidelity	87.3821725719944
I ask but one said the king put the army in battle array and face the enemy	430.7299916635599
That can not be sire said the earl	212.6774324277677
How can not be What hinders it exclaimed the king	689.8272685200263
Your majesty is well aware that there is a truce between us and the English army	60.56519929565664
And if there is a truce the English army has broken it by quitting the town contrary to the agreement which kept it there	333.6236027743347
Now I tell you you must pass with me through this army across to Scotland and if you refuse you may choose betwixt two names which the contempt of all honest men will brand you withyou are either cowards or traitors	388.39313364848823
The eyes of the Scotch flashed fire and as often happens on such occasions from shame they passed to effrontery and two heads of clans advanced upon the king	467.9884306162885
Yes said they we have promised to deliver Scotland and England from him who for the last fiveandtwenty years has sucked the blood and gold of Scotland and England	255.20902637943496
We have promised and we will keep our promise	37.09881487644729
Charles Stuart you are our prisoner	1881.4226112626789
And both extended their hands as if to seize the king but before they could touch him with the tips of their fingers both had fallen one dead the other stunned	133.68174102663835
Aramis had passed his sword through the body of the first and Athos had knocked down the other with the butt end of his pistol	69.86104604825637
Then as Lord Leven and the other chieftains recoiled before this unexpected rescue which seemed to come from Heaven for the prince they already thought was their prisoner Athos and Aramis dragged the king from the perjured assembly into which he had so imprudently ventured and throwing themselves on horseback all three returned at full gallop to the royal tent	240.98868966503323
On their road they perceived Lord Winter marching at the head of his regiment	203.38032285352153
The king motioned him to accompany them	201.09323068926136
They all four entered the tent they had no plan readythey must think of one	387.06554593257107
The king threw himself into an armchair	13.480797090964304
Betrayed yes betrayed by the Scotch amongst whom I was born whom I have always loved better than the English	101.26382930409751
Sire said Athos this is not a moment for recrimination but a time to show yourself a king and a gentleman	115.10624224482679
Up sire up for you have here at least three men who will not betray you	41.43537779664989
Ah if we had been five murmured Athos thinking of DArtagnan and Porthos	928.3096493162976
What do you say inquired Charles rising	4953.229640546586
I say sire that there is now but one way open	105.47274207440982
Lord Winter answers for his regiment or at least very nearly sowe will not split straws about wordslet him place himself at the head of his men we will place ourselves at the side of your majesty and we will mow a swath through Cromwells army and reach Scotland	328.95967781610744
There is another method said Aramis	2961.6551713825916
Let one of us put on the dress and mount the kings horse	145.601619013586
Whilst they pursue him the king might escape	322.9385845917911
It is good advice said Athos and if the king will do one of us the honor we shall be truly grateful to him	79.3645934610847
What do you think of this counsel Winter asked the king looking with admiration at these two men whose chief idea seemed to be how they could take on their shoulders all the dangers that assailed him	215.68109556230036
I think the only chance of saving your majesty has just been proposed by Monsieur dHerblay	191.96313667780393
I humbly entreat your majesty to choose quickly for we have not an instant to lose	173.4186392579982
But if I accept it is death or at least imprisonment for him who takes my place	127.23515967532524
He will have had the glory of having saved his king cried Winter	723.6014281023189
The king looked at his old friend with tears in his eyes undid the Order of the Saint Esprit which he wore to honor the two Frenchmen who were with him and passed it around Winters neck who received on his knees this striking proof of his sovereigns confidence and friendship	176.75843983516503
It is right said Athos he has served your majesty longer than we have	128.106764483104
The king overheard these words and turned around with tears in his eyes	21.845411548498806
Wait a moment sir said he I have an order for each of you also	71.06078112611151
He turned to a closet where his own orders were locked up and took out two ribbons of the Order of the Garter	130.5074710893502
These can not be for us said Athos	218.38840078403393
Such are for royalty and we are simple commoners	739.9065329687209
I shall not find amongst them such great hearts as yours	340.1321097017646
No no you do yourselves injustice but I am here to do you justice	78.8506872191337
Athos knelt down and the king passed the ribbon down from left to right as usual raised his sword and instead of pronouncing the customary formula I make you a knight	316.20997185361216
Be brave faithful and loyal he said You are brave faithful and loyal	230.05887851123683
I knight you monsieur le comte	150.860060204909
Then turning to Aramis he said	4.515301844160666
It is now your turn monsieur le chevalier	799.2559002497001
The same ceremony recommenced with the same words whilst Winter unlaced his leather cuirass that he might disguise himself like the king	372.4178218337715
Charles having proceeded with Aramis as with Athos embraced them both	604.6349811240763
Sire said Winter who in this trying emergency felt all his strength and energy fire up we are ready	318.84810198186585
The king looked at the three gentlemen	833.4605865058461
Then we must fly said he	40.26234596650836
Flying through an army sire said Athos in all countries in the world is called charging	94.43697687855374
Then I shall die sword in hand said Charles	280.66824655823007
Monsieur le comte monsieur le chevalier if ever I am king	199.23772739254903
Sire you have already done us more honor than simple gentlemen could ever aspire to therefore gratitude is on our side	396.5898221240417
But we must not lose time	56.97323283928877
We have already wasted too much	5.759241919206243
The king again shook hands with all three exchanged hats with Winter and went out	417.20614004275023
Winters regiment was ranged on some high ground above the camp	362.787111651494
The king followed by the three friends turned his steps that way	302.2600388981226
The Scotch camp seemed as if at last awakened the soldiers had come out of their tents and taken up their station in battle array	260.9842692689743
Do you see that said the king	76.22499682472062
Perhaps they are penitent and preparing to march	524.198767941174
If they are penitent said Athos let them follow us	191.97011636037843
Well said the king what shall we do	29.005208873085685
Let us examine the enemys army	2972.272924132151
At the same instant the eyes of the little group were fixed on the same line which at daybreak they had mistaken for fog and which the morning sun now plainly showed was an army in order of battle	148.92536168028852
The air was soft and clear as it generally is at that early hour of the morning	105.59891436670247
The regiments the standards and even the colors of the horses and uniforms were now clearly distinct	341.6566129571992
On the summit of a rising ground a little in advance of the enemy appeared a short and heavy looking man this man was surrounded by officers	176.6961813784475
He turned a spyglass toward the little group amongst which the king stood	194.88437839525804
Does this man know your majesty personally inquired Aramis	2487.171845314851
That man is Cromwell said he	13.315803829656597
Then draw down your hat sire that he may not discover the substitution	279.107109055007
Ah said Athos how much time we have lost	86.26659408911395
Now said the king give the word and let us start	56.15713800618859
Will you not give it sire asked Athos	1073.0697191250076
No I make you my lieutenantgeneral said the king	219.76945144023222
What we are going to say does not concern your majesty	111.97624078740603
The king smiling turned a few steps back	46.842371532884904
This is what I propose to do said Athos	64.68115701085074
We will divide our regiments into two squadrons	768.0907305359351
You will put yourself at the head of the first	11.745746581948854
We and his majesty will lead the second	113.88961964445936
If no obstacle occurs we will both charge together force the enemys line and throw ourselves into the Tyne which we must cross either by fording or swimming if on the contrary any repulse should take place you and your men must fight to the last man whilst we and the king proceed on our road	238.59641214314456
Once arrived at the brink of the river should we even find them three ranks deep as long as you and your regiment do your duty we will look to the rest	115.0309498404101
To horse reechoed Athos everything is arranged and decided	305.62799433276393
Now gentlemen cried the king forward and rally to the old cry of France Montjoy and St	998.9358404683318
Denis The war cry of England is too often in the mouths of traitors	302.77837048002937
They mountedthe king on Winters horse and Winter on that of the king then Winter took his place at the head of the first squadron and the king with Athos on his right and Aramis on his left at the head of the second	75.5606743683913
The Scotch army stood motionless and silent seized with shame at sight of these preparations	94.02921933390243
Some of the chieftains left the ranks and broke their swords in two	124.83332076753746
There said the king that consoles me they are not all traitors	538.459222362697
At this moment Winters voice was raised with the cry of Forward	105.90543879532295
The first squadron moved off the second followed and descended from the plateau	130.7937454524302
A regiment of cuirassiers nearly equal as to numbers issued from behind the hill and came full gallop toward it	245.2415994049691
Sire said Athos we foresaw this and if Lord Winters men but do their duty we are saved instead of lost	294.34965019329934
At this moment they heard above all the galloping and neighing of the horses Winters voice crying out	614.3386202577983
At these words every sword was drawn and glittered in the air like lightning	74.92768481872226
Now gentlemen said the king in his turn excited by this sight come gentlemen sword in hand	221.80569592257234
But Aramis and Athos were the only ones to obey this command and the kings example	204.39701671808115
We are betrayed said the king in a low voice	13.613229487423311
Wait a moment said Athos perhaps they do not recognize your majestys voice and await the order of their captain	141.13925694150942
Have they not heard that of their colonel But look look cried the king drawing up his horse with a sudden jerk which threw it on its haunches and seizing the bridle of Athoss horse	269.594543401939
Ah cowards traitors screamed Lord Winter whose voice they heard whilst his men quitting their ranks dispersed all over the plain	427.961407160654
About fifteen men were ranged around him and awaited the charge of Cromwells cuirassiers	270.00636641021623
Let us go and die with them said the king	24.16264335340474
Let us go said Athos and Aramis	140.4237277389047
All faithful hearts with me cried out Winter	2758.32973303837
This voice was heard by the two friends who set off full gallop	49.719142072298226
No quarter cried a voice in French answering to that of Winter which made them tremble	286.28640874347195
As for Winter at the sound of that voice he turned pale and was as it were petrified	55.23844767823588
It was the voice of a cavalier mounted on a magnificent black horse who was charging at the head of the English regiment of which in his ardor he was ten steps in advance	99.1167624506128
Tis he murmured Winter his eyes glazed and he allowed his sword to fall to his side	110.82337936723395
The king the king cried out several voices deceived by the blue ribbon and chestnut horse of Winter take him alive	356.4384636848072
No it is not the king exclaimed the cavalier	270.5051892276445
Lord Winter you are not the king you are my uncle	98.32697457512677
At the same moment Mordaunt for it was he leveled his pistol at Winter it went off and the ball entered the heart of the old cavalier who with one bound on his saddle fell back into the arms of Athos murmuring He is avenged	151.1311678288215
Think of my mother shouted Mordaunt as his horse plunged and darted off at full gallop	215.62563175173082
Wretch exclaimed Aramis raising his pistol as he passed by him but the powder flashed in the pan and it did not go off	115.15477581802236
At this moment the whole regiment came up and they fell upon the few men who had held out surrounding the two Frenchmen	130.11359353819296
Athos after making sure that Lord Winter was really dead let fall the corpse and said	172.9956953240973
Come Aramis now for the honor of France and the two Englishmen who were nearest to them fell mortally wounded	257.61910168840734
At the same moment a fearful hurrah rent the air and thirty blades glittered about their heads	1640.0845481107847
Suddenly a man sprang out of the English ranks fell upon Athos twined arms of steel around him and tearing his sword from him said in his ear	183.99414666656136
Silence yieldyou yield to me do you not	11.112671366085985
A giant had seized also Aramiss two wrists who struggled in vain to release himself from this formidable grasp	496.74074572206297
DArt exclaimed Athos whilst the Gascon covered his mouth with his hand	67.967247548523
I am your prisoner said Aramis giving up his sword to Porthos	181.39268229284463
Fire fire cried Mordaunt returning to the group surrounding the two friends	54.68556637047319
And wherefore fire said the colonel every one has yielded	766.3296901748205
It is the son of Milady said Athos to DArtagnan	536.9291586133999
It is the monk whispered Porthos to Aramis	871.9558227400745
And now the ranks began to open	28.22315125681012
DArtagnan held the bridle of Athoss horse and Porthos that of Aramis	474.50997368552925
Both of them attempted to lead his prisoner off the battlefield	405.10799616148313
This movement revealed the spot where Winters body had fallen	460.5206259527147
Mordaunt had found it out and was gazing on his dead relative with an expression of malignant hatred	116.75187373672847
Athos though now cool and collected put his hand to his belt where his loaded pistols yet remained	234.68475390220624
What are you about said DArtagnan	3717.7851101395336
We are all four lost if by the least gesture you discover that you recognize him	130.57672946864972
Then turning to the young man he exclaimed	25.599584535810855
A fine prize a fine prize friend Mordaunt we have both myself and Monsieur du Vallon taken two Knights of the Garter nothing less	702.3783379162583
But said Mordaunt looking at Athos and Aramis with bloodshot eyes these are Frenchmen I imagine	430.2860409111332
Are you French sir said he to Athos	415.6482198955495
I am replied the latter gravely	7090.4270787714495
Very well my dear sir you are the prisoner of a fellow countryman	130.11666017867392
But the kingwhere is the king exclaimed Athos anxiously	2106.7932268025907
DArtagnan vigorously seized his prisoners hand saying	149.02211531832694
Eh the king We have secured him	462.95323835061066
Yes said Aramis through an infamous act of treason	307.2617560695195
Porthos pressed his friends hand and said to him	21.371216812802384
Yes sir all is fair in war stratagem as well as force look yonder	712.2894343965171
At this instant the squadron that ought to have protected Charless retreat was advancing to meet the English regiments	526.8795311321634
The king who was entirely surrounded walked alone in a great empty space	676.4285489636363
He appeared calm but it was evidently not without a mighty effort	163.20732698615748
Drops of perspiration trickled down his face and from time to time he put a handkerchief to his mouth to wipe away the blood that rilled from it	83.89699053802002
Behold Nebuchadnezzar exclaimed an old Puritan soldier whose eyes flashed at the sight of the man they called the tyrant	156.86933017627626
Do you call him Nebuchadnezzar said Mordaunt with a terrible smile no it is Charles the First the king the good King Charles who despoils his subjects to enrich himself	277.42483236283647
Charles glanced a moment at the insolent creature who uttered this but did not recognize him	104.5116755103511
Nevertheless the calm religious dignity of his countenance abashed Mordaunt	486.8667630783924
Bon jour messieurs said the king to the two gentlemen who were held by DArtagnan and Porthos	78.48507213465281
The day has been unfortunate but it is not your fault thank God But where is my old friend Winter	132.53658777276812
The two gentlemen turned away their heads in silence	78.03167636350246
In Straffords company said Mordaunt tauntingly	191247.109914159
The demon had known how to wound him	249.79143421568176
The remembrance of Strafford was a source of lasting remorse to him the shadow that haunted him by day and night	177.7079540975624
He saw a corpse at his feet	6.000172867183218
He uttered not a word nor shed a tear but a deadly pallor spread over his face he knelt down on the ground raised Winters head and unfastening the Order of the Saint Esprit placed it on his own breast	152.89055439312153
Lord Winter is killed then inquired DArtagnan fixing his eyes on the corpse	52.973098021711714
Yes said Athos by his own nephew	405.1132761908065
Come he was the first of us to go peace be to him he was an honest man said DArtagnan	159.12331740528802
Charles Stuart said the colonel of the English regiment approaching the king who had just put on the insignia of royalty do you yield yourself a prisoner	127.7284792186264
Colonel Tomlison said Charles kings can not yield the man alone submits to force	480.9823760168248
The king drew his sword and broke it on his knee	22.755781363500663
At this moment a horse without a rider covered with foam his nostrils extended and eyes all fire galloped up and recognizing his master stopped and neighed with pleasure it was Arthur	383.881470242114
The king smiled patted it with his hand and jumped lightly into the saddle	35.04763944607142
Now gentlemen said he conduct me where you will	36.91472455292521
Turning back again he said I thought I saw Winter move if he still lives by all you hold most sacred do not abandon him	301.15959791644417
Never fear King Charles said Mordaunt the bullet pierced his heart	432.558426415683
Do not breathe a word nor make the least sign to me or Porthos said DArtagnan to Athos and Aramis that you recognize this man for Milady is not dead her soul lives in the body of this demon	154.53040237812678
The detachment now moved toward the town with the royal captive but on the road an aidedecamp from Cromwell sent orders that Colonel Tomlison should conduct him to Holdenby Castle	614.8317424849513
At the same time couriers started in every direction over England and Europe to announce that Charles Stuart was the prisoner of Oliver Cromwell	397.6783660634907
Have you been to the general said Mordaunt to DArtagnan and Porthos you know he sent for you after the action	196.82144372201196
We want first to put our prisoners in a place of safety replied DArtagnan	134.9244771852311
Do you know sir these gentlemen are each of them worth fifteen hundred pounds	90.14888119024752
Oh be assured said Mordaunt looking at them with an expression he vainly endeavoured to soften my soldiers will guard them and guard them well I promise you	194.86494015444845
I shall take better care of them myself answered DArtagnan besides all they require is a good room with sentinels or their simple parole that they will not attempt escape	336.0294086346308
I will go and see about that and then we shall have the honor of presenting ourselves to the general and receiving his commands for his eminence	74.3464861609051
You think of starting at once then inquired Mordaunt	841.5463189980063
Our mission is ended and there is nothing more to detain us now but the good pleasure of the great man to whom we were sent	68.7604430450884
The young man bit his lips and whispered to his sergeant	103.79384190567545
You will follow these men and not lose sight of them when you have discovered where they lodge come and await me at the town gate	94.06113636392922
The sergeant made a sign of comprehension	612.0787057851173
Instead of following the knot of prisoners that were being taken into the town Mordaunt turned his steps toward the rising ground from whence Cromwell had witnessed the battle and on which he had just had his tent pitched	246.61561479689226
Cromwell had given orders that no one was to be allowed admission but the sentinel who knew that Mordaunt was one of the most confidential friends of the general thought the order did not extend to the young man	92.93885599007072
Mordaunt therefore raised the canvas and saw Cromwell seated before a table his head buried in his hands his back being turned	90.40971370171401
Whether he heard Mordaunt or not as he entered Cromwell did not move	123.3099249814116
Mordaunt remained standing near the door	3.6056753438444393
At last after a few moments Cromwell raised his head and as if he divined that some one was there turned slowly around	133.95335386888485
I said I wished to be alone he exclaimed on seeing the young man	31.449886307803048
They thought this order did not concern me sir nevertheless if you wish it I am ready to go	46.46349665540587
Ah is it you Mordaunt said Cromwell the cloud passing away from his face since you are here it is well you may remain	97.84433437860913
On the capture of Charles Stuart	33306.16935765939
You are now master of England	796.9636115687994
I was much more really so two hours ago	186.3302736509107
Because England had need of me to take the tyrant and now the tyrant is taken	127.53003307513437
Mordaunt hesitated but it seemed as though he was constrained to tell the truth	49.31220600898539
Some parting words to his friends	331.6733441355625
Has he any friends Then he added aloud Did he make any resistance	194.10138816202465
No sir with the exception of two or three friends every one deserted him he had no means of resistance	85.99945325446353
To whom did he give up his sword	30.724623601188878
He did not give it up he broke it	103.31371913112054
He did well but instead of breaking it he might have used it to still more advantage	162.2481195567282
I heard that the colonel of the regiment that escorted Charles was killed said Cromwell staring very fixedly at Mordaunt	1456.906725328751
My uncle answered Mordaunt but traitors to England are no longer members of my family	207.37569253633458
Cromwell observed the young man a moment in silence then with that profound melancholy Shakespeare describes so well	392.19890146691205
Mordaunt he said you are a terrible servant	177.13111380044106
When the Lord commands said Mordaunt His commands are not to be disputed	221.81541551650585
Abraham raised the knife against Isaac and Isaac was his son	604.5583909741753
Yes said Cromwell but the Lord did not suffer that sacrifice to be accomplished	120.07092695457058
I have looked around me said Mordaunt and I have seen neither goat nor kid caught among the bushes of the plain	261.6794685237475
You are strong among the strong Mordaunt he said and the Frenchmen how did they behave	822.931763611048
Yes yes murmured Cromwell the French fight well and if my glass was good and I mistake not they were foremost in the fight	234.92743428404845
It was the fault of their horses not theirs	506.03900940137476
They kept their word and never stirred said Mordaunt	6759.836333670381
Their officers wish to see you sir	100.16603572935806
I have no time to see them	102.57128434821414
Let them be off and return to their own country there to hide their shame if its hills are high enough I have nothing more to do with them nor they with me	90.51636276121778
Before I go said Mordaunt I have some questions and a favor to ask you sir	69.82649877500243
I come to you my leader my head my father and I ask you master are you contented with me	137.21760674169303
Cromwell looked at him with astonishment	126.06675175598947
Yes said Cromwell you have done since I knew you not only your duty but more than your duty you have been a faithful friend a cautious negotiator a brave soldier	109.65995567291881
Do you remember sir it was my idea the Scotch treaty for giving up the king	335.3757065286474
I had no such contempt for men before	215.07205471677972
Was I not a good ambassador in France	324.82091990596325
Yes for Mazarin has granted what I desire	128.40735119563374
Have I not always fought for your glory and interests	210.09279108307246
Too ardently perhaps it is what I have just reproached you for	75.13888638540601
But what is the meaning of all these questions	20.92417538334256
To tell you my lord that the moment has now arrived when with a single word you may recompense all these services	112.36949632132394
Oh said Oliver with a slight curl of his lip I forgot that every service merits some reward and that up to this moment you have not been paid	207.1422628900288
Sir I can take my pay at this moment to the full extent of my wishes	78.1794192502297
I have the payment under my hand I almost possess it	118.02819950438911
What is it Have they offered you money Do you wish a step or some place in the government	138.74030030147705
Sir will you grant me my request	70.3368035512311
Let us hear what it is first	27.5638964819919
Sir when you have told me to obey an order did I ever answer Let me see that order	143.70070311608617
If however your wish should be one impossible to fulfill	205.9342845354325
When you have cherished a wish and have charged me with its fulfillment have I ever replied It is impossible	176.67940847527302
But a request preferred with so much preparation	140.99797504004388
Ah do not fear sir said Mordaunt with apparent simplicity it will not ruin you	80.43929362989654
Well then said Cromwell I promise as far as lies in my power to grant your request proceed	178.2048868470419
Sir two prisoners were taken this morning will you let me have them	73.20156457609635
For their ransom have they then offered a large one inquired Cromwell	884.4214507657229
On the contrary I think they are poor sir	161.89170958452135
They are friends of yours then	283.23540774363914
Yes sir exclaimed Mordaunt they are friends dear friends of mine and I would lay down my life for them	70.9771175418023
Very well Mordaunt exclaimed Cromwell pleased at having his opinion of the young man raised once more I will give them to you I will not even ask who they are do as you like with them	103.26895975569342
Thank you sir exclaimed Mordaunt thank you my life is always at your service and should I lose it I should still owe you something thank you you have indeed repaid me munificently for my services	92.94665331544888
He threw himself at the feet of Cromwell and in spite of the efforts of the Puritan general who did not like this almost kingly homage he took his hand and kissed it	94.08574938881753
What said Cromwell arresting him for a moment as he arose is there nothing more you wish neither gold nor rank	250.01309169039018
You have given me all you can give me and from today your debt is paid	102.03331834497054
And Mordaunt darted out of the generals tent his heart beating and his eyes sparkling with joy	89.48880687021473
Cromwell gazed a moment after him	61.246300647696934
He has slain his uncle he murmured	47.309856639462666
Alas what are my servants Possibly this one who asks nothing or seems to ask nothing has asked more in the eyes of Heaven than those who tax the country and steal the bread of the poor	263.47055962762107
Charles who is my prisoner may still have friends but I have none	79.54882241014055
And with a deep sigh he again sank into the reverie that had been interrupted by Mordaunt	82.99472970018796
Whilst Mordaunt was making his way to Cromwells tent DArtagnan and Porthos had brought their prisoners to the house which had been assigned to them as their dwelling at Newcastle	218.09043958631239
The order given by Mordaunt to the sergeant had been heard by DArtagnan who accordingly by an expressive glance warned Athos and Aramis to exercise extreme caution	305.54101463835553
The prisoners therefore had remained silent as they marched along in company with their conquerorswhich they could do with the less difficulty since each of them had occupation enough in answering his own thoughts	183.2721484491967
It would be impossible to describe Mousquetons astonishment when from the threshold of the door he saw the four friends approaching followed by a sergeant with a dozen men	149.61272117714273
He rubbed his eyes doubting if he really saw before him Athos and Aramis and forced at last to yield to evidence he was on the point of breaking forth in exclamations when he encountered a glance from the eyes of Porthos the repressive force of which he was not inclined to dispute	150.80937148831205
Mousqueton remained glued to the door awaiting the explanation of this strange occurrence	170.90770896702114
What upset him completely was that the four friends seemed to have no acquaintance with one another	65.93124627773715
The house to which DArtagnan and Porthos conducted Athos and Aramis was the one assigned to them by General Cromwell and of which they had taken possession on the previous evening	120.12178983173422
It was at the corner of two streets and had in the rear bordering on the side street stables and a sort of garden	206.00830351188398
The windows on the ground floor according to a custom in provincial villages were barred so that they strongly resembled the windows of a prison	409.8510619462047
The two friends made the prisoners enter the house first whilst they stood at the door desiring Mousqueton to take the four horses to the stable	131.45644761197764
Why do nt we go in with them asked Porthos	151.06046933663677
We must first see what the sergeant wishes us to do replied DArtagnan	536.2799960934968
The sergeant and his men took possession of the little garden	62.047379324052045
DArtagnan asked them what they wished and why they had taken that position	105.7756076448642
We have had orders answered the man to help you in taking care of your prisoners	73.85532437823699
There could be no fault to find with this arrangement on the contrary it seemed to be a delicate attention to be gratefully received DArtagnan therefore thanked the man and gave him a crown piece to drink to General Cromwells health	204.68520177653218
The sergeant answered that Puritans never drank and put the crown piece in his pocket	156.97856969531395
Ah said Porthos what a fearful day my dear DArtagnan	337.94676204297326
What a fearful day when today we find our friends	126.52941316711389
Tis true that our position is an awkward one but let us go in and see more clearly what is to be done	50.0425595500521
Things look black enough replied Porthos I understand now why Aramis advised me to strangle that horrible Mordaunt	740.6134603836247
Silence cried the Gascon do not utter that name	63.44544478710927
But argued Porthos I speak French and they are all English	167.48489372843
DArtagnan looked at Porthos with that air of wonder which a cunning man can not help feeling at displays of crass stupidity	396.0354268333462
But as Porthos on his side could not comprehend his astonishment he merely pushed him indoors saying Let us go in	198.0060338433705
They found Athos in profound despondency Aramis looked first at Porthos and then at DArtagnan without speaking but the latter understood his meaningful look	664.774883662487
You want to know how we came here Tis easily guessed	1820.2329891892693
Mazarin sent us with a letter to General Cromwell	420.19305646461896
But how came you to fall into company with Mordaunt whom I bade you distrust asked Athos	564.775986683886
And whom I advised you to strangle Porthos said Aramis	1112.3452598473425
Cromwell had sent him to Mazarin	22937.956914688853
There is a certain fatality in it	70.28151076774711
Yes you are right DArtagnan a fatality that will separate and ruin us So my dear Aramis say no more about it and let us prepare to submit to destiny	185.1300643434288
Zounds on the contrary let us speak about it for it was agreed among us once for all that we should always hold together though engaged on opposing sides	136.3106700903707
Yes added Athos I now ask you DArtagnan what side you are on Ah behold for what end the wretched Mazarin has made use of you	329.3144576498068
Do you know in what crime you are today engaged In the capture of a king his degradation and his murder	317.7524162340104
Oh oh cried Porthos do you think so	18.15553894533966
You are exaggerating Athos we are not so far gone as that replied the lieutenant	105.3048328861769
Good heavens we are on the very eve of it	59.691609170309974
I say why is the king taken prisoner Those who wish to respect him as a master would not buy him as a slave	226.75515732896474
Do you think it is to replace him on the throne that Cromwell has paid for him two hundred thousand pounds sterling They will kill him you may be sure of it	117.08533488776149
I do nt maintain the contrary said DArtagnan	552.3143024287673
But what s that to us I am here because I am a soldier and have to obey ordersI have taken an oath to obey and I do obey but you who have taken no such oath why are you here and what cause do you represent	112.45862192268424
That most sacred in the world said Athos the cause of misfortune of religion royalty	346.21323209786425
A friend a wife a daughter have done us the honor to call us to their aid	71.55399933076778
We have served them to the best of our poor means and God will recompense the will forgive the want of power	160.16641811057949
You may see matters differently DArtagnan and think otherwise	1429.1274806188505
I will not attempt to argue with you but I blame you	192.01406967173895
Heyday cried DArtagnan what matters it to me after all if Cromwell who s an Englishman revolts against his king who is a Scotchman I am myself a Frenchman	308.50437023398894
I have nothing to do with these thingswhy hold me responsible	377.11822604069386
Because all gentlemen are brothers because you are a gentleman because the kings of all countries are the first among gentlemen because the blind populace ungrateful and brutal always takes pleasure in pulling down what is above them	468.10116816536106
And you you DArtagnan a man sprung from the ancient nobility of France bearing an honorable name carrying a good sword have helped to give up a king to beersellers shopkeepers and wagoners	397.33578926223987
Ah DArtagnan perhaps you have done your duty as a soldier but as a gentleman I say that you are very culpable	55.40605387326452
DArtagnan was chewing the stalk of a flower unable to reply and thoroughly uncomfortable for when turned from the eyes of Athos he encountered those of Aramis	273.29511967804314
And you Porthos continued the count as if in consideration for DArtagnans embarrassment you the best heart the best friend the best soldier that I knowyou with a soul that makes you worthy of a birth on the steps of a throne and who sooner or later must receive your reward from an intelligent kingyou my dear Porthos you a gentleman in manners in tastes and in courage you are as culpable as DArtagnan	258.78060774438586
Porthos blushed but with pleasure rather than with confusion and yet bowing his head as if humiliated he said	149.5600866359608
Yes yes my dear count I feel that you are right	18.574781463829773
Come he said stretching out his hand to DArtagnan come do nt be sullen my dear son for I have said all this to you if not in the tone at least with the feelings of a father	60.90292912153681
It would have been easier to me merely to have thanked you for preserving my life and not to have uttered a word of all this	54.33894015654473
But here it is you have sentiments the devil knows what such as every one ca nt entertain	428.6667834211552
Who could suppose that a sensible man could leave his house France his warda charming youth for we saw him in the campto fly to the aid of a rotten wormeaten royalty which is going to crumble one of these days like an old hovel	386.976662214675
The sentiments you air are certainly fine so fine that they are superhuman	297.3968923315355
However that may be DArtagnan replied Athos without falling into the snare which his Gascon friend had prepared for him by an appeal to his parental love however that may be you know in the bottom of your heart that it is true but I am wrong to dispute with my master	110.39149403112438
DArtagnan I am your prisonertreat me as such	497.07734539691376
Ah pardieu said DArtagnan you know you will not be my prisoner very long	71.2085121410768
No said Aramis they will doubtless treat us like the prisoners of the Philipghauts	240.37627548854562
And how were they treated asked DArtagnan	725.9038750447604
Why said Aramis onehalf were hanged and the other half were shot	425.56864621945556
Well I said DArtagnan I answer that while there remains a drop of blood in my veins you will be neither hanged nor shot	206.0844124668683
Sang Diou let them come on Besidesdo you see that door Athos	619.2500506937381
Well you can go out by that door whenever you please for from this moment you are free as the air	82.17305406975649
I recognize you there my brave DArtagnan replied Athos but you are no longer our masters	174.97451021956283
That door is guarded DArtagnan you know that	29.752940413270558
Very well you will force it said Porthos	190.65634099484538
There are only a dozen men at the most	59.154776504981164
That would be nothing for us four it is too much for us two	70.3960102405351
No divided as we now are we must perish	273.13292708394715
See the fatal example on the Vendomois road DArtagnan you so brave and you Porthos so valiant and so strongyou were beaten today Aramis and I are beaten in our turn	717.5110718865731
Now that never happened to us when we were four together	77.83691214214971
Let us die then as De Winter has died as for me I will fly only on condition that we all fly together	282.0204357245225
Impossible said DArtagnan we are under Mazarins orders	3759.1000724962278
I know it and I have nothing more to say my arguments lead to nothing doubtless they are bad since they have not determined minds so just as yours	201.5722841333003
Besides said Aramis had they taken effect it would be still better not to compromise two excellent friends like DArtagnan and Porthos	287.11851548773876
Be assured gentlemen we shall do you honor in our dying	117.80399998058985
As for myself I shall be proud to face the bullets or even the rope in company with you Athos for you have never seemed to me so grand as you are today	129.07542284623642
DArtagnan said nothing but after having gnawed the flower stalk he began to bite his nails	477.244661130331
Do you imagine he resumed that they mean to kill you And wherefore should they do so What interest have they in your death Moreover you are our prisoners	272.1931097330772
Fool cried Aramis knowest thou not then Mordaunt I have but exchanged with him one look yet that look convinced me that we were doomed	182.33212426092143
The truth is I m very sorry that I did not strangle him as you advised me said Porthos	89.0034878367562
Eh I make no account of the harm Mordaunt can do cried DArtagnan	770.5934501047869
Cap de Diou if he troubles me too much I will crush him the insect Do not fly then	339.39772644017313
It is useless for I swear to you that you are as safe here as you were twenty years agoyou Athos in the Rue Ferou and you Aramis in the Rue de Vaugirard	143.7113673752801
Stop cried Athos extending his hand to one of the grated windows by which the room was lighted you will soon know what to expect for here he is	71.3133665487754
In fact looking at the place to which Athos pointed DArtagnan saw a cavalier coming toward the house at full gallop	249.9822083928332
DArtagnan rushed out of the room	6.277873851268238
Stay said DArtagnan and do not come till you hear me drum my fingers on the door	91.60367563699772
When Mordaunt arrived opposite the house he saw DArtagnan on the threshold and the soldiers lying on the grass here and there with their arms	97.13168039452295
Halloo he cried are the prisoners still there	1068.2539700950786
Yes sir answered the sergeant uncovering	646252.9724443825
Tis well order four men to conduct them to my lodging	156.0850377274131
Four men prepared to do so	3.0966703795486508
What is it said DArtagnan with that jeering manner which our readers have so often observed in him since they made his acquaintance	121.85330069199331
What is the matter if you please	5.060277718792045
Sir replied Mordaunt I have ordered the two prisoners we made this morning to be conducted to my lodging	195.36896753490316
Wherefore sir Excuse curiosity but I wish to be enlightened on the subject	42.19558293082968
Because these prisoners sir are at my disposal and I choose to dispose of them as I like	61.9666394309637
Allow meallow me sir said DArtagnan to observe you are in error	201.72499759294138
The prisoners belong to those who take them and not to those who only saw them taken	128.51774802880905
You might have taken Lord Winterwho tis said was your uncleprisoner but you preferred killing him tis well we that is Monsieur du Vallon and I could have killed our prisonerswe preferred taking them	577.8243604512187
Mordaunts very lips grew white with rage	7.493284434802995
DArtagnan now saw that affairs were growing worse and he beat the guards march upon the door	362.9009121138518
At the first beat Porthos rushed out and stood on the other side of the door	14.22253733433267
This movement was observed by Mordaunt	43414.83327656087
Sir he thus addressed DArtagnan your resistance is useless these prisoners have just been given me by my illustrious patron Oliver Cromwell	350.2147106220192
These words struck DArtagnan like a thunderbolt	46.254390723047905
The blood mounted to his temples his eyes became dim he saw from what fountainhead the ferocious hopes of the young man arose and he put his hand to the hilt of his sword	64.50749696819865
As for Porthos he looked inquiringly at DArtagnan	1375.7404219680084
This look of Porthoss made the Gascon regret that he had summoned the brute force of his friend to aid him in an affair which seemed to require chiefly cunning	154.51961738007313
Violence he said to himself would spoil all DArtagnan my friend prove to this young serpent that thou art not only stronger but more subtle than he is	272.4686931285671
Ah he said making a low bow why did you not begin by saying that Monsieur Mordaunt What are you sent by General Oliver Cromwell the most illustrious captain of the age	159.9628173578435
I have this instant left him replied Mordaunt alighting in order to give his horse to a soldier to hold	122.58796361717668
Why did you not say so at once my dear sir all England is with Cromwell and since you ask for my prisoners I bend sir to your wishes	146.44594258646904
Mordaunt delighted advanced Porthos looking at DArtagnan with openmouthed astonishment	610.24894039346
Then DArtagnan trod on his foot and Porthos began to understand that this was merely acting	129.7987749742994
Mordaunt put his foot on the first step of the door and with his hat in hand prepared to pass by the two friends motioning to the four men to follow him	40.57196969878886
But pardon said DArtagnan with the most charming smile and putting his hand on the young mans shoulder if the illustrious General Oliver Cromwell has disposed of our prisoners in your favour he has of course made that act of donation in writing	172.4267471612667
He has given you some little writing for methe least bit of paper which may show that you come in his name	232.34927580825698
Be pleased to give me that scrap of paper so that I may justify by a pretext at least my abandoning my countrymen	228.33083092529662
Otherwise you see although I am sure that General Oliver Cromwell can intend them no harm it would have a bad appearance	184.96582919300675
Mordaunt recoiled he felt the blow and discharged a terrible look at DArtagnan who responded by the most amiable expression that ever graced a human countenance	297.6091722065417
When I tell you a thing sir said Mordaunt you insult me by doubting it	237.53264515208485
I cried DArtagnan I doubt what you say God keep me from it my dear Monsieur Mordaunt On the contrary I take you to be a worthy and accomplished gentleman	76.94018613144604
And then sir do you wish me to speak freely to you continued DArtagnan with his frank expression	106.18530336638574
Monsieur du Vallon yonder is rich and has forty thousand francs yearly so he does not care about money	103.77367247236484
I do not speak for him but for myself	75.3914418429999
In Gascony tis no dishonor sir nobody is rich and Henry IV	558.6115064940811
of glorious memory who was the king of the Gascons as His Majesty Philip IV	746.3548944725184
is the king of the Spaniards never had a penny in his pocket	259.31245759383324
Go on sir I see what you wish to get at and if it is simply what I think that stops you I can obviate the difficulty	138.11815069104773
Ah I knew well said the Gascon that you were a man of talent	40.55199570123532
Well heres the case heres where the saddle hurts me as we French say	1025.3476122881737
I am an officer of fortune nothing else I have nothing but what my sword brings me inthat is to say more blows than banknotes	169.4822777661481
Now on taking prisoners this morning two Frenchmen who seemed to me of high birthin short two knights of the GarterI said to myself my fortune is made	317.37768852687384
I say two because in such circumstances Monsieur du Vallon who is rich always gives me his prisoners	96.2969162732041
Mordaunt completely deceived by the wordy civility of DArtagnan smiled like a man who understands perfectly the reasons given him and said	457.4998406110851
I shall have the order signed directly sir and with it two thousand pistoles meanwhile let me take these men away	388.8451375581407
No replied DArtagnan what signifies a delay of half an hour I am a man of order sir let us do things in order	81.79614545610505
Nevertheless replied Mordaunt I could compel you I command here	494.30847292621655
Ah sir said DArtagnan I see that although we have had the honor of traveling in your company you do not know us	43.79106784945223
We are gentlemen we are both of us able to kill you and your eight menwe two only	371.8057293120391
For Heavens sake do nt be obstinate for when others are obstinate I am obstinate likewise and then I become ferocious and headstrong and there s my friend who is even more headstrong and ferocious than myself	325.4143089959775
Besides we are sent here by Cardinal Mazarin and at this moment represent both the king and the cardinal and are therefore as ambassadors able to act with impunity a thing that General Oliver Cromwell who is assuredly as great a politician as he is a general is quite the man to understand	279.1089542796566
Ask him then for the written order	10725.980033560163
What will that cost you my dear Monsieur Mordaunt	162.07846746021488
Yes the written order said Porthos who now began to comprehend what DArtagnan was aiming at we ask only for that	320.4990759738163
However inclined Mordaunt was to have recourse to violence he understood the reasons DArtagnan had given him besides completely ignorant of the friendship which existed between the four Frenchmen all his uneasiness disappeared when he heard of the plausible motive of the ransom	229.8461616759668
He decided therefore not only to fetch the order but the two thousand pistoles at which he estimated the prisoners	176.20999637477615
He therefore mounted his horse and disappeared	34.85501786905594
Good thought DArtagnan a quarter of an hour to go to the tent a quarter of an hour to return it is more than we need	25.491614224795686
Then turning without the least change of countenance to Porthos he said looking him full in the face Friend Porthos listen to this first not a syllable to either of our friends of what you have heard it is unnecessary for them to know the service we are going to render them	138.72156870477022
Go to the stable you will find Mousqueton there saddle your horses put your pistols in your saddlebags take out the horses and lead them to the street below this so that there will be nothing to do but mount them all the rest is my business	177.88778924144137
Porthos made no remark but obeyed with the sublime confidence he had in his friend	104.75984617687082
I go he said only shall I enter the chamber where those gentlemen are	92.66421069883293
No it is not worth while	472.4510713355144
Well do me the kindness to take my purse which I left on the mantelpiece	74.90449081531709
He then proceeded with his usual calm gait to the stable and went into the very midst of the soldiery who foreigner as he was could not help admiring his height and the enormous strength of his great limbs	212.71720737112108
At the corner of the street he met Mousqueton and took him with him	58.93453789793075
DArtagnan meantime went into the house whistling a tune which he had begun before Porthos went away	278.03435207801516
My dear Athos I have reflected on your arguments and I am convinced	116.0455080253459
I am sorry to have had anything to do with this matter	61.16510756114513
As you say Mazarin is a knave	1128.0856918850254
I have resolved to fly with you not a wordbe ready	237.7628669454621
Your swords are in the corner do not forget them they are in many circumstances very useful there is Porthoss purse too	428.75168101068033
He put it into his pocket	42.349592763772094
The two friends were perfectly stupefied	3193.709124598828
Well pray is there anything to be so surprised at he said	90.9152217441608
I was blind Athos has made me see that s all come here	99.25729691433591
The two friends went near him	28.558904110634284
Do you see that street There are the horses	144.4055431536485
Go out by the door turn to the right jump into your saddles all will be right do nt be uneasy at anything except mistaking the signal	194.29061913926287
That will be the signal when I call outJesus Seigneur	1959.5126692736462
But give us your word that you will come too DArtagnan said Athos	190.73183849103606
I swear I will by Heaven	3836.982027545785
Tis settled said Aramis at the cry Jesus Seigneur we go out upset all that stands in our way run to our horses jump into our saddles spur them is that all	489.9742976050415
See Aramis as I have told you DArtagnan is first amongst us all said Athos	297.36582872516294
Very true replied the Gascon but I always run away from compliments	161.01927843084152
Do nt forget the signal Jesus Seigneur and he went out as he came in whistling the selfsame air	433.830305025479
The soldiers were playing or sleeping two of them were singing in a corner out of tune the psalm On the rivers of Babylon	275.7333860018548
My dear friend General Cromwell has sent Monsieur Mordaunt to fetch me	178.2972732208803
Guard the prisoners well I beg of you	19.536981413987153
The sergeant made a sign as much as to say he did not understand French and DArtagnan tried to make him comprehend by signs and gestures	156.95390179622802
Then he went into the stable he found the five horses saddled his own amongst the rest	224.89843660358184
Each of you take a horse by the bridle he said to Porthos and Mousqueton turn to the left so that Athos and Aramis may see you clearly from the window	138.95953835433062
They are coming then said Porthos	1955.1165922927114
You did nt forget my purse	867.6108248199267
Porthos and Mousqueton each took a horse by the bridle and proceeded to their post	43.04777505108823
Then DArtagnan being alone struck a light and lighted a small bit of tinder mounted his horse and stopped at the door in the midst of the soldiers	67.71366996829816
There caressing as he pretended the animal with his hand he put this bit of burning tinder in his ear	114.29162533066406
It was necessary to be as good a horseman as he was to risk such a scheme for no sooner had the animal felt the burning tinder than he uttered a cry of pain and reared and jumped as if he had been mad	131.12248777017226
The soldiers whom he was nearly trampling ran away	1450.2900395637048
Help help cried DArtagnan stopmy horse has the staggers	830.4773026240103
In an instant the horses eyes grew bloodshot and he was white with foam	319.4351234408362
What will you let me be killed Jesus Seigneur	5470.743160571814
No sooner had he uttered this cry than the door opened and Athos and Aramis rushed out	86.40643645096266
The coast owing to the Gascons stratagem was clear	3768.215254212423
The prisoners are escaping the prisoners are escaping cried the sergeant	772.0972057697196
Stop stop cried DArtagnan giving rein to his famous steed who darting forth overturned several men	1318.676567840614
Stop stop cried the soldiers and ran for their arms	110.82027830716683
But the prisoners were in their saddles and lost no time hastening to the nearest gate	212.23291339076778
In the middle of the street they saw Grimaud and Blaisois who were coming to find their masters	164.43886214353702
With one wave of his hand Athos made Grimaud who followed the little troop understand everything and they passed on like a whirlwind DArtagnan still directing them from behind with his voice	391.2234442347225
They passed through the gate like apparitions without the guards thinking of detaining them and reached the open country	356.16481778294786
All this time the soldiers were calling out Stop stop and the sergeant who began to see that he was the victim of an artifice was almost in a frenzy of despair	108.51153846981475
Whilst all this was going on a cavalier in full gallop was seen approaching	172.9123693014072
It was Mordaunt with the order in his hand	85.76335262975051
The prisoners he exclaimed jumping off his horse	25.109721401785407
The sergeant had not the courage to reply he showed him the open door the empty room	88.18302664084108
Mordaunt darted to the steps understood all uttered a cry as if his very heart was pierced and fell fainting on the stone steps	184.462938917383
Noble Natures never lose Courage nor good Stomachs their Appetites	1365.4080790883017
The little troop without looking behind them or exchanging a word fled at a rapid gallop fording a little stream of which none of them knew the name and leaving on their left a town which Athos declared to be Durham	301.2748193501677
At last they came in sight of a small wood and spurring their horses afresh rode in its direction	257.4574055894783
As soon as they had disappeared behind a green curtain sufficiently thick to conceal them from the sight of any one who might be in pursuit they drew up to hold a council together	157.16337080701396
The two grooms held the horses that they might take a little rest without being unsaddled and Grimaud was posted as sentinel	243.69083115560395
Come first of all said Athos to DArtagnan my friend that I may shake hands with youyou our rescueryou the true hero of us all	414.61576084504
Athos is rightyou have my adoration said Aramis in his turn pressing his hand	127.08938368748014
To what are you not equal with your superior intelligence infallible eye your arm of iron and your enterprising mind	435.9129496085177
Now said the Gascon that is all well I accept for Porthos and myself everythingthanks and compliments we have plenty of time to spare	206.2501620628429
The two friends recalled by DArtagnan to what was also due to Porthos pressed his hand in their turn	196.85364861930623
And now said Athos it is not our plan to run anywhere and like madmen but we must map up our campaign	362.7058589470298
What are we going to do ifaith It is not very difficult to say	72.03457916298524
We are going to reach the nearest seaport unite our little resources hire a vessel and return to France	607.8307112845449
As for me I will give my last sou for it	208.52261871744238
Life is the greatest treasure and speaking candidly ours hangs by a thread	1931.71573279428
What do you say to this Du Vallon	567.9533398651577
I said Porthos I am entirely of DArtagnans opinion this is a beastly country this England	940.3559842698288
You are quite decided then to leave it asked Athos of DArtagnan	332.3145213851314
Egad I do nt see what is to keep me here	35.4750043030818
A glance was exchanged between Athos and Aramis	109.16063893402637
Go then my friends said the former sighing	1140.1117242316468
No my friend said Athos you must leave us	22.799832992003108
Leave you cried DArtagnan quite bewildered at this unexpected announcement	136.91715563197116
Bah said Porthos why separate since we are all together	89.61544200397665
Because you can and ought to return to France your mission is accomplished but ours is not	95.4257840164626
Your mission is not accomplished exclaimed DArtagnan looking in astonishment at Athos	711.3469602293446
No my friend replied Athos in his gentle but decided voice we came here to defend King Charles we have but ill defended himit remains for us to save him	461.8616879606732
To save the king said DArtagnan looking at Aramis as he had looked at Athos	224.85632608495317
Aramis contented himself by making a sign with his head	18.06573202954767
DArtagnans countenance took an expression of the deepest compassion he began to think he had to do with madmen	101.67790461388442
You can not be speaking seriously Athos said he the king is surrounded by an army which is conducting him to London	226.6003422397284
This army is commanded by a butcher or the son of a butcherit matters littleColonel Harrison	747.3507890289061
His majesty I can assure you will be tried on his arrival in London I have heard enough from the lips of Oliver Cromwell to know what to expect	133.07569344889527
A second look was exchanged between Athos and Aramis	174.28745627434338
And when the trial is ended there will be no delay in putting the sentence into execution continued DArtagnan	319.45779160064217
And to what penalty do you think the king will be condemned asked Athos	100.51523580435425
The penalty of death I greatly fear they have gone too far for him to pardon them and there is nothing left to them but one thing and that is to kill him	68.90559588337057
Have you never heard what Oliver Cromwell said when he came to Paris and was shown the dungeon at Vincennes where Monsieur de Vendome was imprisoned	244.1872174304986
What did he say asked Porthos	3037.822038411717
Princes must be knocked on the head	22.754604986112266
And you fancy he will not put his maxim into execution now that he has got hold of the king	224.96050446827022
On the contrary I am certain he will do so	39.694730003588305
But then that is all the more reason why we should not abandon the august head so threatened	284.94808768357797
No my friend Athos gently replied but De Winter sought us out in France and introduced us Monsieur dHerblay and myself to Madame Henrietta	541.2900317485983
Her majesty did us the honor to ask our aid for her husband	113.69767126620619
We engaged our word our word included everything	2483.2758063734304
It was our strength our intelligence our life in short that we promised	305.83005861963227
It remains now for us to keep our word	28.520750854136995
Yes said Aramis we have promised	46.28623372989014
Then continued Athos we have another reason it is thislisten In France at this moment everything is poor and paltry	299.78242790696123
We have a king ten years old who does nt yet know what he wants we have a queen blinded by a belated passion we have a minister who governs France as he would govern a great farmthat is to say intent only on turning out all the gold he can by the exercise of Italian cunning and invention we have princes who set up a personal and egotistic opposition who will draw from Mazarins hands only a few ingots of gold or some shreds of power granted as bribes	393.3297900584387
I have served them without enthusiasmGod knows that I estimated them at their real value and that they are not high in my esteembut on principle	404.08351217605394
Today I am engaged in a different affair	57.8127909575807
I have encountered misfortune in a high place a royal misfortune a European misfortune I attach myself to it	231.4610758583058
If we can succeed in saving the king it will be good if we die for him it will be grand	58.86647833240761
So you know beforehand you must perish said DArtagnan	593.1123163987596
We fear so and our only regret is to die so far from both of you	87.67984631063334
What will you do in a foreign land an enemys country	1995.6753555995672
I traveled in England when I was young I speak English like an Englishman and Aramis too knows something of the language	317.743274252307
Ah if we had you my friends With you DArtagnan with you Porthosall four reunited for the first time for twenty yearswe would dare not only England but the three kingdoms put together	533.1317945345783
And did you promise the queen resumed DArtagnan petulantly to storm the Tower of London to kill a hundred thousand soldiers to fight victoriously against the wishes of the nation and the ambition of a man and when that man is Cromwell Do not exaggerate your duty	257.9950166664257
In Heavens name my dear Athos do not make a useless sacrifice	101.08980563503108
When I see you merely you look like a reasonable being when you speak I seem to have to do with a madman	108.79367168255352
Come Porthos join me say frankly what do you think of this business	56.76495062902781
Come continued DArtagnan who irritated that instead of listening to him Athos seemed to be attending to his own thoughts you have never found yourself the worse for my advice	104.94550741090413
Well then believe me Athos your mission is ended and ended nobly return to France with us	219.0155586949031
Friend said Athos our resolution is irrevocable	980.4666400719797
Then you have some other motive unknown to us	241.85574434968453
Athos smiled and DArtagnan struck his hands together in anger and muttered the most convincing reasons that he could discover but to all these reasons Athos contented himself by replying with a calm sweet smile and Aramis by nodding his head	179.1145681696735
Very well cried DArtagnan at last furious very well since you wish it let us leave our bones in this beggarly land where it is always cold where fine weather is a fog fog is rain and rain a deluge where the sun represents the moon and the moon a cream cheese in truth whether we die here or elsewhere matters little since we must die	365.43694913431597
Only reflect my good fellow said Athos it is but dying rather sooner	262.3845394435295
Pooh a little sooner or a little later it is nt worth quarreling over	341.6972195635707
If I am astonished at anything remarked Porthos sententiously it is that it has not already happened	497.9868857223486
Oh it will happen you may be sure said DArtagnan	133.87772772512452
So it is agreed and if Porthos makes no objection	1162.0284940265435
I said Porthos I will do whatever you please and besides I think what the Comte de la Fere said just now is very good	43.57525349069058
But your future career DArtagnanyour ambition Porthos	41830.510299692185
Our future our ambition replied DArtagnan with feverish volubility	757.9306564158114
Need we think of that since we are to save the king The king savedwe shall assemble our friends togetherwe will head the Puritansreconquer England we shall reenter Londonplace him securely on his throne	866.205171968218
And he will make us dukes and peers said Porthos whose eyes sparkled with joy at this imaginary prospect	291.4608525909528
Or he will forget us added DArtagnan	1976.4530225517553
Well that has happened friend Porthos	34090.37751529576
It seems to me that we once rendered Anne of Austria a service not much less than that which today we are trying to perform for Charles I	173.35561928939728
but none the less Anne of Austria has forgotten us for twenty years	28.57580398043942
Well in spite of that DArtagnan said Athos you are not sorry that you were useful to her	91.11047602313694
No indeed said DArtagnan I admit even that in my darkest moments I find consolation in that remembrance	484.6397983415382
You see then DArtagnan though princes often are ungrateful God never is	1636.6459643687667
Athos said DArtagnan I believe that were you to fall in with the devil you would conduct yourself so well that you would take him with you to Heaven	56.834320673681724
So then said Athos offering his hand to DArtagnan	32.00014430989186
I find England a charming country and I staybut on one condition only	623.7411348464759
That I am not forced to learn English	1009.4843778546244
Well now said Athos triumphantly I swear to you my friend by the God who hears usI believe that there is a power watching over us and that we shall all four see France again	109.48728943378823
So be it said DArtagnan but II confess I have a contrary conviction	452.5777280487554
Our good DArtagnan said Aramis represents among us the opposition in parliament which always says no and always does aye	1336.4507191629864
But in the meantime saves the country added Athos	917.6714709536365
Well now that everything is decided cried Porthos rubbing his hands suppose we think of dinner It seems to me that in the most critical positions of our lives we have always dined	212.08544676882764
Oh yes speak of dinner in a country where for a feast they eat boiled mutton and as a treat drink beer	651.9510441487236
What the devil did you come to such a country for Athos But I forgot added the Gascon smiling pardon I forgot you are no longer Athos but never mind let us hear your plan for dinner Porthos	211.59482380412243
No I am hungry that is all	68.40942429506404
Pardieu if that is all I am hungry too but it is not everything to be hungry one must find something to eat unless we browse on the grass like our horses	159.79369792513322
Ah exclaimed Aramis who was not quite so indifferent to the good things of the earth as Athos do you remember when we were at Parpaillot the beautiful oysters that we ate	200.76222385104884
And the legs of mutton of the salt marshes said Porthos smacking his lips	879.0415306741374
But suggested DArtagnan have we not our friend Mousqueton who managed for us so well at Chantilly Porthos	406.6250800299818
Yes said Porthos we have Mousqueton but since he has been steward he has become very heavy never mind let us call him and to make sure that he will reply agreeably	241.20289100197462
Mouston appeared with a most piteous face	778.5346373191685
What is the matter my dear M	10.315622256270116
Sir I am very hungry replied Mouston	3105.5370850456266
Well it is just for that reason that we have called you my good M	87.39619831137416
Could you not procure us a few of those nice little rabbits and some of those delicious partridges of which you used to make fricassees at the hotel Faith I do not remember the name of the hotel	187.5329540610779
At the hotel of said Porthos by my faithnor do I remember it either	461.4725721138995
It does not matter and a few of those bottles of old Burgundy wine which cured your master so quickly of his sprain	601.2029329999843
Alas sir said Mousqueton I much fear that what you ask for are very rare things in this detestable and barren country and I think we should do better to go and seek hospitality from the owner of a little house we see on the fringe of the forest	107.39067122242801
How is there a house in the neighborhood asked DArtagnan	271.8723386689927
Well let us as you say go and ask a dinner from the master of that house	101.50068225740539
What is your opinion gentlemen and does not M	82.908714818761
Moustons suggestion appear to you full of sense	346.7064568329426
Oh said Aramis suppose the master is a Puritan	382.9388975845856
So much the better mordioux replied DArtagnan if he is a Puritan we will inform him of the capture of the king and in honor of the news he will kill for us his fatted hens	133.9246427786259
But if he should be a cavalier said Porthos	732.8040134221004
In that case we will put on an air of mourning and he will pluck for us his black fowls	212.12373567359919
You are very happy exclaimed Athos laughing in spite of himself at the sally of the irresistible Gascon for you see the bright side of everything	205.6157710436915
What would you have said DArtagnan	2248.6156298407373
I come from a land where there is not a cloud in the sky	46.5593125201588
It is not like this then said Porthos stretching out his hand to assure himself whether a chill sensation he felt on his cheek was not really caused by a drop of rain	183.14709471906608
Come come said DArtagnan more reason why we should start on our journey	117.30540689907417
Well Grimaud my friend have you seen anything asked the Gascon	83.60181964987186
Those idiots cried Porthos they have not even pursued us	79.65231485005765
Oh if we had been in their place	124.99623637236832
Yes they are wrong said DArtagnan	3434.073278611393
I would willingly have said two words to Mordaunt in this little desert	217.17447550508973
It is an excellent spot for bringing down a man in proper style	386.97109594722224
I think decidedly observed Aramis gentlemen that the son has nt his mothers energy	516.6301398928531
What my good fellow replied Athos wait awhile we have scarcely left him two hours agohe does not know yet in what direction we came nor where we are	410.0754383017446
We may say that he is not equal to his mother when we put foot in France if we are not poisoned or killed before then	100.48254994113368
Meanwhile let us dine suggested Porthos	13552.962374761566
Ifaith yes said Athos for I am hungry	40.640298738346054
Look out for the black fowls cried Aramis	7526.082829767801
And the four friends guided by Mousqueton took up the way toward the house already almost restored to their former gayety for they were now as Athos had said all four once more united and of single mind	241.33031492261534
As our fugitives approached the house they found the ground cut up as if a considerable body of horsemen had preceded them	160.976682309701
Before the door the traces were yet more apparent these horsemen whoever they might be had halted there	444.1376569645824
Egad cried DArtagnan its quite clear that the king and his escort have been by here	164.0560613006478
The devil said Porthos in that case they have eaten everything	173.1194132120445
Bah said DArtagnan they will have left a chicken at least	185.31904724680277
He dismounted and knocked on the door	13.097375088341908
He pushed open the door and found the first room empty and deserted	41.42426562095808
I can see nobody said DArtagnan	1478.1510096615082
At this word the three friends leaped from their horses and entered	133.97154206640866
DArtagnan had already opened the door of the second room and from the expression of his face it was clear that he there beheld some extraordinary object	60.162378585201346
The three friends drew near and discovered a young man stretched on the ground bathed in a pool of blood	63.34930362492947
It was evident that he had attempted to regain his bed but had not had sufficient strength to do so	70.14804766677115
Athos who imagined that he saw him move was the first to go up to him	47.84809559060142
Well if he is dead said Athos he has not been so long for he is still warm	58.84505902529722
But no his heart is beating	22726.15935598255
The wounded man heaved a sigh	162.7115541552884
DArtagnan took some water in the hollow of his hand and threw it upon his face	27.44812364395465
The man opened his eyes made an effort to raise his head and fell back again	25.727297277653168
The wound was in the top of his skull and blood was flawing copiously	576.1351370629441
Aramis dipped a cloth into some water and applied it to the gash	162.47950941046238
Again the wounded man opened his eyes and looked in astonishment at these strangers who appeared to pity him	43.871380971650545
You are among friends said Athos in English so cheer up and tell us if you have the strength to do so what has happened	98.88028986843187
The king muttered the wounded man the king is a prisoner	52.38512485153829
You have seen him asked Aramis in the same language	48.66963166900103
Make your mind easy resumed Athos we are all faithful servants of his majesty	183.15624734584938
Is what you tell me true asked the wounded man	123.9150106911304
Then I may tell you all	28.54139679960734
I am brother to Parry his majestys lackey	3275.145719060006
Athos and Aramis remembered that this was the name by which De Winter had called the man they had found in the passage of the kings tent	81.3206817055519
We know him said Athos he never left the king	184.65653181866605
Well he thought of me when he saw the king was taken and as they were passing before the house he begged in the kings name that they would stop as the king was hungry	83.62020051235861
They brought him into this room and placed sentinels at the doors and windows	207.84657166113695
Parry knew this room as he had often been to see me when the king was at Newcastle	109.36303776287374
He knew that there was a trapdoor communicating with a cellar from which one could get into the orchard	268.15892934446515
He made a sign which I understood but the kings guards must have noticed it and held themselves on guard	156.0241086755779
I went out as if to fetch wood passed through the subterranean passage into the cellar and whilst Parry was gently bolting the door pushed up the board and beckoned to the king to follow me	232.7440891493381
But Parry clasped his hands and implored him and at last he agreed	190.10025486911437
The king was a few steps behind me when suddenly I saw something rise up in front of me like a huge shadow	116.2547236396304
I wanted to cry out to warn the king but that very moment I felt a blow as if the house was falling on my head and fell insensible	99.8846173250976
When I came to myself again I was stretched in the same place	55.721554181666974
I dragged myself as far as the yard	24.056439723811017
The king and his escort were no longer there	51.506204516845045
I spent perhaps an hour in coming from the yard to this place then my strength gave out and I fainted again	180.51040952247567
And now how are you feeling	15702.74122119783
Very ill replied the wounded man	1.6924633907847055
Can we do anything for you asked Athos	216.99049841756062
Help to put me on the bed I think I shall feel better there	47.736360576521726
Have you any one to depend on for assistance	674.1101877867869
My wife is at Durham and may return at any moment	46.892378208483876
But youis there nothing that you want	35.52127802557129
We came here with the intention of asking for something to eat	122.23873121825442
Alas they have taken everything there is nt a morsel of bread in the house	61.4314305708627
You hear DArtagnan said Athos we shall have to look elsewhere for our dinner	179.32679627659306
It is all one to me now said DArtagnan I am no longer hungry	78.72214942431803
Faith neither am I said Porthos	2173.9485963501174
They carried the man to his bed and called Grimaud to dress the wound	219.64083160192376
In the service of the four friends Grimaud had had so frequent occasion to make lint and bandages that he had become something of a surgeon	344.49527783995524
In the meantime the fugitives had returned to the first room where they took counsel together	108.85823039889627
Now said Aramis we know how the matter stands	330.999699303025
The king and his escort have gone this way we had better take the opposite direction eh	554.8324520522484
Athos did not reply he reflected	708.3019617899721
Yes said Porthos let us take the opposite direction if we follow the escort we shall find everything devoured and die of hunger	193.75613341113407
What a confounded country this England is This is the first time I have gone without my dinner for ten years and it is generally my best meal	89.45828863194907
What do you think DArtagnan asked Athos	164.67810679609434
Not at all said DArtagnan I am precisely of the contrary opinion	125.45396943601608
What you would follow the escort exclaimed Porthos in dismay	2356.612999872383
No I would join the escort	10758.055183232305
Let DArtagnan speak said Athos you know he always has wise advice to give	161.24602966142416
Clearly said DArtagnan we must go where they will not look for us	51.13858285951054
Now they will be far from looking for us among the Puritans therefore with the Puritans we must go	238.55779856182002
Good my friend good said Athos	6614.074177092907
I was about to give it when you anticipated me	93.52096132528743
That then is your opinion asked Aramis	469.4696713181957
They will think we are trying to leave England and will search for us at the ports meanwhile we shall reach London with the king	161.642357114813
Once in London we shall be hard to findwithout considering continued Athos throwing a glance at Aramis the chances that may come to us on the way	379.1663182881465
I however do not understand said Porthos	566.2624616843709
But no matter since it is at the same time the opinion of DArtagnan and of Athos it must be the best	49.17470461664838
But said Aramis shall we not be suspected by Colonel Harrison	422.26676123338984
Egad cried DArtagnan he s just the man I count upon	151.7228689149917
Colonel Harrison is one of our friends	17.95667842587528
We have met him twice at General Cromwells	2890.9595254694427
He knows that we were sent from France by Monsieur Mazarin he will consider us as brothers	211.86996781771035
Besides is he not a butchers son Well then Porthos shall show him how to knock down an ox with a blow of the fist and I how to trip up a bull by taking him by the horns	230.78526474854613
You are the best companion that I know DArtagnan he said offering his hand to the Gascon and I am very happy in having found you again my dear son	88.63702128231795
This was as we have seen the term which Athos applied to DArtagnan in his more expansive moods	1055.107359979848
At this moment Grimaud came in	19.10993175546618
He had stanched the wound and the man was better	48.47809753343115
The four friends took leave of him and asked if they could deliver any message for him to his brother	76.93545952477633
Tell him answered the brave man to let the king know that they have not killed me outright	102.0258402615208
However insignificant I am I am sure that his majesty is concerned for me and blames himself for my death	122.36947298155094
Be easy said DArtagnan he will know all before night	216.23819158643846
The little troop recommenced their march and at the end of two hours perceived a considerable body of horsemen about half a league ahead	154.4969849343716
My dear friends said DArtagnan give your swords to Monsieur Mouston who will return them to you at the proper time and place and do not forget you are our prisoners	99.88516059140098
It was not long before they joined the escort	251.94411302833134
The king was riding in front surrounded by troopers and when he saw Athos and Aramis a glow of pleasure lighted his pale cheeks	222.63380963280898
DArtagnan passed to the head of the column and leaving his friends under the guard of Porthos went straight to Harrison who recognized him as having met him at Cromwells and received him as politely as a man of his breeding and disposition could	141.58209584204604
It turned out as DArtagnan had foreseen	188.2524552033819
The colonel neither had nor could have any suspicion	65.90312565438101
They halted for the king to dine	178.69618353755072
This time however due precautions were taken to prevent any attempt at escape	257.3742313159368
In the large room of the hotel a small table was placed for him and a large one for the officers	64.12478796716911
Will you dine with me asked Harrison of DArtagnan	890.9817918753248
Gad I should be very happy but I have my companion Monsieur du Vallon and the two prisoners whom I can not leave	48.99725566977845
Have a table set for us in a corner and send us whatever you like from yours	146.5174901432572
The matter was arranged as DArtagnan had suggested and when he returned he found the king already seated at his little table where Parry waited on him Harrison and his officers sitting together at another table and in a corner places reserved for himself and his companions	264.66963917126805
The table at which the Puritan officers were seated was round and whether by chance or coarse intention Harrison sat with his back to the king	408.04050631142167
The king saw the four gentlemen come in but appeared to take no notice of them	99.57122645981612
They sat down in such a manner as to turn their backs on nobody	201.35950602818565
The officers table and that of the king were opposite to them	105.17981857483949
Ifaith colonel said DArtagnan we are very grateful for your gracious invitation for without you we ran the risk of going without dinner as we have without breakfast	215.49242993985428
My friend here Monsieur du Vallon shares my gratitude for he was particularly hungry	349.5125564201763
And I am so still said Porthos bowing to Harrison	429.6187070415213
And how said Harrison laughing did this serious calamity of going without breakfast happen to you	678.356357862035
In a very simple manner colonel said DArtagnan	2540.6263725401263
I was in a hurry to join you and took the road you had already gone by	56.9762892036407
You can understand our disappointment when arriving at a pretty little house on the skirts of a wood which at a distance had quite a gay appearance with its red roof and green shutters we found nothing but a poor wretch bathedAh colonel pay my respects to the officer of yours who struck that blow	174.36525296614798
Yes said Harrison laughing and looking over at one of the officers seated at his table	90.50121340884286
When Groslow undertakes this kind of thing there s no need to go over the ground a second time	75.86828983359678
Ah it was this gentleman said DArtagnan bowing to the officer	80.13868799567794
I am sorry he does not speak French that I might tender him my compliments	189.12260046132803
I am ready to receive and return them sir said the officer in pretty good French for I resided three years in Paris	202.66942851054043
Then sir allow me to assure you that your blow was so well directed that you have nearly killed your man	122.33556557300871
Nearly I thought I had quite said Groslow	731.9202023250829
It was a very near thing but he is not dead	47.76459944747942
As he said this DArtagnan gave a glance at Parry who was standing in front of the king to show him that the news was meant for him	84.79016702896897
The king too who had listened in the greatest agony now breathed again	293.9741858251371
Hang it said Groslow I thought I had succeeded better	119.93502755049778
If it were not so far from here to the house I would return and finish him	58.303736304708785
And you would do well if you are afraid of his recovering for you know if a wound in the head does not kill at once it is cured in a week	95.59990444229561
And DArtagnan threw a second glance toward Parry on whose face such an expression of joy was manifested that Charles stretched out his hand to him smiling	135.37558981089828
Parry bent over his masters hand and kissed it respectfully	106.69625733007082
I ve a great desire to drink the kings health said Athos	207.44435495031038
Let me propose it then said DArtagnan	286.82718058146133
Porthos looked at DArtagnan quite amazed at the resources with which his companions Gascon sharpness continually supplied him	711.3832058071494
DArtagnan took up his camp tin cup filled it with wine and arose	205.93009094741763
Gentlemen said he let us drink to him who presides at the repast	271.02859181673716
Heres to our colonel and let him know that we are always at his commands as far as London and farther	110.72585166214363
And as DArtagnan as he spoke looked at Harrison the colonel imagined the toast was for himself	973.530942534568
He arose and bowed to the four friends whose eyes were fixed on Charles while Harrison emptied his glass without the slightest misgiving	225.42950560199094
The king in return looked at the four gentlemen and drank with a smile full of nobility and gratitude	49.94999109298658
Come gentlemen cried Harrison regardless of his illustrious captive let us be off	206.0804334308364
Parry said the king rising too my horse I desire to go to Thirsk	237.70841264001237
Egad said DArtagnan to Athos your king has thoroughly taken me and I am quite at his service	93.78772579636876
If what you say is sincere replied Athos he will never reach London	566.2263314571435
Because before then we shall have carried him off	87.20429746170646
Well this time Athos said DArtagnan upon my word you are mad	151.90924090151225
Have you some plan in your head then asked Aramis	153.90640705262442
Ay said Porthos the thing would not be impossible with a good plan	53.0546764705412
I have none said Athos but DArtagnan will discover one	474.8823110214231
DArtagnan shrugged his shoulders and they proceeded	232.77948762949765
As night closed in they arrived at Thirsk	761.7798691926939
The four friends appeared to be entire strangers to one another and indifferent to the precautions taken for guarding the king	321.29188875049573
They withdrew to a private house and as they had reason every moment to fear for their safety they occupied but one room and provided an exit which might be useful in case of an attack	145.6822534945732
The lackeys were sent to their several posts except that Grimaud lay on a truss of straw across the doorway	589.3416461949992
DArtagnan was thoughtful and seemed for the moment to have lost his usual loquacity	98.38359784910679
Porthos who could never see anything that was not selfevident talked to him as usual	188.5117200132465
He replied in monosyllables and Athos and Aramis looked significantly at one another	311.9534287156082
Next morning DArtagnan was the first to rise	104.4492046219681
He had been down to the stables already taken a look at the horses and given the necessary orders for the day whilst Athos and Aramis were still in bed and Porthos snoring	236.5175969008285
At eight oclock the march was resumed in the same order as the night before except that DArtagnan left his friends and began to renew the acquaintance which he had already struck up with Monsieur Groslow	115.92492398654925
Groslow whom DArtagnans praises had greatly pleased welcomed him with a gracious smile	194.38909359722942
Really sir DArtagnan said to him I am pleased to find one with whom to talk in my own poor tongue	75.8038721088947
My friend Monsieur du Vallon is of a very melancholy disposition so much so that one can scarcely get three words out of him all day	90.6023554724689
As for our two prisoners you can imagine that they are but little in the vein for conversation	147.67659422045875
They are hot royalists said Groslow	13584.627056769605
The more reason they should be sulky with us for having captured the Stuart for whom I hope you re preparing a pretty trial	268.49591825550254
Why said Groslow that is just what we are taking him to London for	194.61160233694653
And you never by any chance lose sight of him I presume	51.04612783366634
You see he has a truly royal escort	17918.32303587227
Ay there s no fear in the daytime but at night	155.13259936807404
And what method of surveillance do you employ	105.57236568186134
Eight men remain constantly in his room	29.079958867521746
The deuce he is well guarded then	2789.5330990121943
But besides these eight men you doubtless place some guard outside	1408.2711505172772
What would you have two men without arms do against eight armed men	539.7417671828846
Yes the king and his lackey	34838.020849160996
Oh then they allow the lackey to remain with him	158.13155374341298
Yes Stuart begged this favor and Harrison consented	5605.642360483318
Under pretense that he s a king it appears he can not dress or undress without assistance	264.0323254441152
Really captain said DArtagnan determined to continue on the laudatory tack on which he had commenced the more I listen to you the more surprised I am at the easy and elegant manner in which you speak French	110.60642588734612
You have lived three years in Paris May I ask what you were doing there	57.10633772369399
My father who is a merchant placed me with his correspondent who in turn sent his son to join our house in London	270.0468386729431
Were you pleased with Paris sir	233.00564466231427
Yes but you are much in want of a revolution like our ownnot against your king who is a mere child but against that lazar of an Italian the queens favorite	379.77788052115187
Ah I am quite of your opinion sir and we should soon make an end of Mazarin if we had only a dozen officers like yourself without prejudices vigilant and incorruptible	330.96945139212545
But said the officer I thought you were in his service and that it was he who sent you to General Cromwell	58.40698644137522
That is to say I am in the kings service and that knowing he wanted to send some one to England I solicited the appointment so great was my desire to know the man of genius who now governs the three kingdoms	160.8170325095022
So that when he proposed to us to draw our swords in honor of old England you see how we snapped up the proposition	204.21749224793584
Yes I know that you charged by the side of Mordaunt	296.5023887930264
On his right and left sir	21197.47811931765
Ah there s another brave and excellent young man	93.48188261513008
Do you know him asked the officer	120.06084744366163
Monsieur du Vallon and myself came from France with him	103.84014404655304
It appears too you kept him waiting a long time at Boulogne	101.03321866492035
What would you have I was like you and had a king in keeping	126.86254494437038
Our own to be sure the little oneLouis XIV	2530.1064475534217
And how long had you to take care of him	20.82034127474651
Three nights and by my troth I shall always remember those three nights with a certain pleasure	270.85875559055955
I mean that my friends officers in the guards and mousquetaires came to keep me company and we passed the night in feasting drinking dicing	631.9865019660608
Ah true said the Englishman with a sigh you Frenchmen are born boon companions	753.7064637631016
And do nt you play too when you are on guard	77.0255137933229
In that case you must be horribly bored and have my sympathy	549.5903834461876
The fact is I look to my turn for keeping guard with horror	377.4929892322153
Its tiresome work to keep awake a whole night	508.08599918279265
Yes but with a jovial partner and dice and guineas clinking on the cloth the night passes like a dream	474.4122360939788
You do nt like playing then	270.9138621689703
I used to play almost every night in France	85.8630771646529
And since your return to England	2921.189986024869
I have not handled a card or dicebox	3124.393554741765
I sincerely pity you said DArtagnan with an air of profound compassion	48.63140814236687
Yes come and pass the night with me	48.80452845966486
I play with Monsieur du Vallon every night	121.96971392332298
Sometimes we do nt go to bed at all	27.068040961013672
Why he would be annoyed if I did not play with him	44.16526274173067
I have seen him lose as much as two thousand pistoles laughing all the while till the tears rolled down	138.73572697196158
Yes and give them a chance of escaping said DArtagnan	410.6610165475749
Why one of them is a rich lord from Touraine and the other a knight of Malta of noble family	201.85783019357592
We have arranged the ransom of each of them2000 on arriving in France	202.85558212419423
We are reluctant to leave for a single moment men whom our lackeys know to be millionaires	288.63185939761934
It is true we plundered them a little when we took them and I will even confess that it is their purse that Monsieur du Vallon and I draw on in our nightly play	179.9832093349575
Still they may have concealed some precious stone some valuable diamond so that we are like those misers who are unable to absent themselves from their treasures	189.11385016561397
We have made ourselves the constant guardians of our men and while I sleep Monsieur du Vallon watches	413.9536891394421
You see then why I must decline your polite invitation which is especially attractive to me because nothing is so wearisome as to play night after night with the same person the chances always balance and at the months end nothing is gained or lost	397.50858610995704
Ah said Groslow sighing there is something still more wearisome and that is not to play at all	86.34214786932436
I can understand that said DArtagnan	1737.6087399194307
But come resumed the Englishman are these men of yours dangerous	311.65361961158186
Are they capable of attempting violence	8889.792581598324
DArtagnan burst out laughing at the idea	26.244991944733872
Jesus Dieu he cried one of them is trembling with fever having failed to adapt himself to this charming country of yours and the other is a knight of Malta as timid as a young girl and for greater security we have taken from them even their penknives and pocket scissors	180.08377648340817
Well then said Groslow bring them with you	19.694172077689636
I have eight men on guard you know	144.8709735998942
Four of them can guard the king and the other four your prisoners	134.44650390672837
Ill manage it somehow you will see	18.716481459246122
But said DArtagnan now I think of itwhat is to prevent our beginning tonight	262.15260203746664
Come to us this evening and tomorrow well return your visit	147.5410279543686
Capital This evening with you tomorrow at Stuarts the next day with me	194.25824504587382
You see that with a little forethought one can lead a merry life anywhere and everywhere said DArtagnan	667.7640283992295
Yes with Frenchmen and Frenchmen like you	122.36695519150153
And Monsieur du Vallon added the other	19.656410292703246
You will see what a fellow he is a man who nearly killed Mazarin between two doors	388.60582300316685
They employ him because they are afraid of him	43.31767443856269
Ah there he is calling me now	81.44514791052788
You ll excuse me I know	45.47334245303049
They exchanged bows and DArtagnan returned to his companions	47.690060310720526
What on earth can you have been saying to that bulldog exclaimed Porthos	418.20752508506894
My dear fellow do nt speak like that of Monsieur Groslow	188.08894310895485
He s one of my most intimate friends	61.95386900448597
One of your friends cried Porthos this butcher of unarmed farmers	5584.13595040449
Monsieur Groslow is perhaps rather hasty its true but at bottom I have discovered two good qualities in himhe is conceited and stupid	658.1226945908228
Porthos opened his eyes in amazement Athos and Aramis looked at one another and smiled they knew DArtagnan and knew that he did nothing without a purpose	200.1183053885412
But continued DArtagnan you shall judge of him for yourself	76.91879196625733
He is coming to play with us this evening	35.95474576150453
Oho said Porthos his eyes glistening at the news	473.4686601564537
He s the son of one of the wealthiest merchants in London	330.1810318876743
Good said Porthos we shall pass an agreeable evening	445.8188231793402
The more so as it will be the prelude to a better	138.9222238191711
We invite him to play tonight he has invited us in return tomorrow	199.26276052708934
Tonight we stop at Derby and if there is a bottle of wine in the town let Mousqueton buy it	86.95859169689768
It will be well to prepare a light supper of which you Athos and Aramis are not to partakeAthos because I told him you had a fever Aramis because you are a knight of Malta and wo nt mix with fellows like us	205.66693367909048
That s no doubt very fine said Porthos but deuce take me if I understand at all	188.29284290902717
Porthos my friend you know I am descended on the fathers side from the Prophets and on the mothers from the Sybils and that I only speak in parables and riddles	186.72255240042537
Let those who have ears hear and those who have eyes see I can tell you nothing more at present	103.0288140035691
Go ahead my friend said Athos I am sure that whatever you do is well done	95.7490752485857
And you Aramis are you of that opinion	211.02788948676613
Very good said DArtagnan here indeed are true believers it is a pleasure to work miracles before them they are not like that unbelieving Porthos who must see and touch before he will believe	281.23776808565793
The fact is said Porthos with an air of finesse I am rather incredulous	79.95657772019555
DArtagnan gave him playful buffet on the shoulder and as they had reached the station where they were to breakfast the conversation ended there	79.69276248290524
At five in the evening they sent Mousqueton on before as agreed upon	1053.7280864628492
In crossing the principal street in Derby the four friends perceived Blaisois standing in the doorway of a handsome house	223.1208170606899
It was there a lodging was prepared for them	100.4996166936098
At the hour agreed upon Groslow came	28399.31629909633
DArtagnan received him as he would have done a friend of twenty years standing	57.07580711884418
Porthos scanned him from head to foot and smiled when he discovered that in spite of the blow he had administered to Parrys brother he was not nearly so strong as himself	113.0541663349944
Athos and Aramis suppressed as well as they could the disgust they felt in the presence of such coarseness and brutality	98.17507605208709
In short Groslow seemed to be pleased with his reception	105.91348640041075
Athos and Aramis kept themselves to their role	312.2608655581918
At midnight they withdrew to their chamber the door of which was left open on the pretext of kindly consideration	127.27016717011392
Furthermore DArtagnan went with them leaving Porthos at play with Groslow	2104.7067911596228
Porthos gained fifty pistoles from Groslow and found him a more agreeable companion than he had at first believed him to be	153.1520232122341
As to Groslow he promised himself that on the following evening he would recover from DArtagnan what he had lost to Porthos and on leaving reminded the Gascon of his appointment	177.97368146099342
The next day was spent as usual	43.35538321433072
DArtagnan went from Captain Groslow to Colonel Harrison and from Colonel Harrison to his friends	476.67751623349693
To any one not acquainted with him he seemed to be in his normal condition but to his friendsto Athos and Aramiswas apparent a certain feverishness in his gayety	244.64936300728007
What is he contriving asked Aramis	2483.8663568470533
Porthos said nothing but he handled in his pocket the fifty pistoles he had gained from Groslow with a degree of satisfaction which betrayed itself in his whole bearing	152.71106689481132
Arrived at Ryston DArtagnan assembled his friends	133.39985920330096
His face had lost the expression of careless gayety it had worn like a mask the whole day	388.4440844291551
The moment is at hand he said	10.27721237784312
Yes returned DArtagnan who had overheard him tonight gentlemen we rescue the king	952.7166840304832
DArtagnan said Athos this is no joke I trust It would quite cut me up	330.31128592604324
You are a very odd man Athos he replied to doubt me thus	278.6629052593239
Where and when have you seen me trifle with a friends heart and a kings life I have told you and I repeat it that tonight we rescue Charles I	140.40044425499218
You left it to me to discover the means and I have done so	46.67861221317323
Porthos looked at DArtagnan with an expression of profound admiration	9.786836421607749
Aramis smiled as one who hopes	434743.9317338253
Athos was pale and trembled in every limb	597.9749634784229
We are invited replied DArtagnan to pass the night with M	48.90331436279241
Yes gentlemen in the kings room	39.47961052683535
Groslow is on guard there this evening and to pass the time away he has invited us to keep him company	117.67979869546299
All four of us asked Athos	4952.607323223731
Pardieu certainly all four we could nt leave our prisoners could we	274.0497117377532
Tell us about it said Athos palpitating	59024.85815049483
We are going then we two with our swords you with daggers	347.4987991152549
We four have got to master these eight fools and their stupid captain	2352.253573582785
Monsieur Porthos what do you say to that	41.718862952159576
I say it is easy enough answered Porthos	969.6063675587015
We dress the king in Groslows clothes	26799.062096696245
Mousqueton Grimaud and Blaisois have our horses saddled at the end of the first street	85.27080806398148
We mount them and before daylight are twenty leagues distant	836.5025305555068
Athos placed his two hands on DArtagnans shoulders and gazed at him with his calm sad smile	99.12701393867836
I declare my friend said he that there is not a creature under the sky who equals you in prowess and in courage	235.37592858330737
Whilst we thought you indifferent to our sorrows which you could nt share without crime you alone among us have discovered what we were searching for in vain	188.87510276834084
I repeat it DArtagnan you are the best one among us I bless and love you my dear son	62.82903902642866
And to think that I could nt find that out said Porthos scratching his head it is so simple	145.67568153566728
But said Aramis if I understand rightly we are to kill them all eh	346.75248384092777
Mordioux answered DArtagnan I believe we must	89.11874824693662
I confess I can discover no other safe and satisfactory way	671.9861388874492
Let us see said Aramis how are we to act	184.81737432378955
Firstly at a given signal which shall be the words At last you each plunge a dagger into the heart of the soldier nearest to you	138.82719604775352
We on our side do the same	17.524332779296035
We shall then be matched four against the remaining five	318.6552591474043
If these five men give themselves up we gag them if they resist we kill them	366.15111515800754
If by chance our Amphitryon changes his mind and receives only Porthos and myself why then we must resort to heroic measures and each give two strokes instead of one	594.434574992295
It will take a little longer time and may make a greater disturbance but you will be outside with swords and will rush in at the proper time	126.83765775025616
But if you yourselves should be struck said Athos	150.3662583715981
Impossible said DArtagnan those beer drinkers are too clumsy and awkward	1415.7029130740573
Besides you will strike at the throat Porthos it kills as quickly and prevents all outcry	2277.533367286994
Very good said Porthos it will be a nice little throat cutting	430.88042067152446
Nonsense said DArtagnan you would do as much Mr	232.749367520681
But if you think the kings life is not worth what it must cost there s an end of the matter and I send to Groslow to say I am ill	104.62849915917198
No you are right said Athos	9099.957034482002
At this moment a soldier entered to inform them that Groslow was waiting for them	139.52943735695231
In the room of the English Nebuchadnezzar replied the staunch Puritan	3525.5015027136506
Good replied Athos whose blood mounted to his face at the insult offered to royalty tell the captain we are coming	198.74008635051726
The lackeys had been ordered to saddle eight horses and to wait keeping together and without dismounting at the corner of a street about twenty steps from the house where the king was lodged	122.29729846023697
It was nine oclock in the evening the sentinels had been relieved at eight and Captain Groslow had been on guard for an hour	97.67535589637208
DArtagnan and Porthos armed with their swords and Athos and Aramis each carrying a concealed poniard approached the house which for the time being was Charles Stuarts prison	484.69830234203
The two latter followed their captors in the humble guise of captives without arms	887.6329482118032
Ods bodikins said Groslow as the four friends entered I had almost given you up	117.71355914989002
DArtagnan went up to him and whispered in his ear	40.0580574400098
The fact is we that is Monsieur du Vallon and I hesitated a little	103.71069233396233
DArtagnan looked significantly toward Athos and Aramis	17.520812016890922
Aha said Groslow on account of political opinions No matter	1260.7010414306064
On the contrary he added laughing if they want to see their Stuart they shall see him	207.34045435368407
Are we to pass the night in the kings room asked DArtagnan	77.01359627587121
No but in the one next to it and as the door will remain open it comes to the same thing	98.55926905936478
Have you provided yourself with money I assure you I intend to play the devils game tonight	247.56403004271624
DArtagnan rattled the gold in his pockets	53.86819652929708
Very good said Groslow and opened the door of the room	13.998484675162176
I will show you the way and he went in first	155.17364439417366
DArtagnan turned to look at his friends	113.92239851599825
Porthos was perfectly indifferent Athos pale but resolute Aramis was wiping a slight moisture from his brow	216.18020491554995
The eight guards were at their posts	1036.5538885288388
Four in the kings room two at the door between the rooms and two at that by which the friends had entered	90.59749360448359
Athos smiled when he saw their bare swords he felt it was no longer to be a butchery but a fight and he resumed his usual good humor	174.1210129384631
Charles was perceived through the door lying dressed upon his bed at the head of which Parry was seated reading in a low voice a chapter from the Bible	100.67629987962788
A candle of coarse tallow on a black table lighted up the handsome and resigned face of the king and that of his faithful retainer far less calm	197.0344763509144
From time to time Parry stopped thinking the king whose eyes were closed was really asleep but Charles would open his eyes and say with a smile	112.22337518233225
Go on my good Parry I am listening	23.775622704667363
Groslow advanced to the door of the kings room replaced on his head the hat he had taken off to receive his guests looked for a moment contemptuously at this simple yet touching scene then turning to DArtagnan assumed an air of triumph at what he had achieved	143.07315241353717
Capital cried the Gascon you would make a distinguished general	173.64470225078745
And do you think asked Groslow that Stuart will ever escape while I am on guard	417.4385630283066
No to be sure replied DArtagnan unless forsooth the sky rains friends upon him	5297.949140669321
It is impossible to say whether Charles who kept his eyes constantly closed had noticed the insolence of the Puritan captain but the moment he heard the clear tone of DArtagnans voice his eyelids rose in spite of himself	210.1233982622091
Parry too started and stopped reading	1827.2200195302253
What are you thinking about said the king go on my good Parry unless you are tired	210.95127255322316
On a table in the next room were lighted candles cards two diceboxes and dice	1250.4549891580086
Gentlemen said Groslow I beg you will take your places	38.87066911001275
I will sit facing Stuart whom I like so much to see especially where he now is and you Monsieur dArtagnan opposite to me	172.1154334747062
That s it said DArtagnan you Monsieur le Comte de la Fere to the right of Monsieur Groslow	74.09887438858317
You Chevalier dHerblay to his left	766.5120902414333
You ll bet for me and those gentlemen for Monsieur Groslow	328.1360606901195
By this arrangement DArtagnan could nudge Porthos with his knee and make signs with his eyes to Athos and Aramis	168.18250451544424
At the names Comte de la Fere and Chevalier dHerblay Charles opened his eyes and raising his noble head in spite of himself threw a glance at all the actors in the scene	90.0758987762208
At that moment Parry turned over several leaves of his Bible and read with a loud voice this verse in Jeremiah	242.70121800439205
God said Hear ye the words of the prophets my servants whom I have sent unto you	108.57709106564226
The words that Parry had read assured them that their presence was understood by the king and was assigned to its real motive	183.72496765402533
You asked me just now if I was in funds said DArtagnan placing some twenty pistoles upon the table	245.46905292398168
Well in my turn I advise you to keep a sharp lookout on your treasure my dear Monsieur Groslow for I can tell you we shall not leave this without robbing you of it	96.84913372897367
Not without my defending it said Groslow	1078.7854238343841
So much the better said DArtagnan	4633.5304436367005
You know or you do nt know that that is what we ask of you	45.17824361096513
Oh yes said Groslow bursting with his usual coarse laugh I know you Frenchmen want nothing but cuts and bruises	369.1100567191137
Charles had heard and understood it all	45.86839048474926
A slight color mounted to his cheeks	22.953945689172986
The soldiers then saw him stretch his limbs little by little and under the pretense of much heat throw off the Scotch plaid which covered him	428.65346812765154
Athos and Aramis started with delight to find that the king was lying with his clothes on	69.50049549806944
The luck had turned and Groslow having won some hundred pistoles was in the merriest possible humor	1402.22849029351
Porthos who had lost the fifty pistoles he had won the night before and thirty more besides was very cross and questioned DArtagnan with a nudge of the knee as to whether it would not soon be time to change the game	234.7190514917635
Athos and Aramis looked at him inquiringly	1204.9541512157068
They heard the guard going its rounds	14649.607290598009
How many rounds do they make a night asked DArtagnan drawing more pistoles from his pocket	239.90654677983156
Five answered Groslow one every two hours	170.06488542849644
DArtagnan glanced at Athos and Aramis and for the first time replied to Porthoss nudge of the knee by a nudge responsive	468.1172352913594
Meanwhile the soldiers whose duty it was to remain in the kings room attracted by that love of play so powerful in all men had stolen little by little toward the table and standing on tiptoe lounged watching the game over the shoulders of DArtagnan and Porthos	203.59435062210937
Those on the other side had followed their example thus favoring the views of the four friends who preferred having them close at hand to chasing them about the chamber	363.8162414020753
The two sentinels at the door still had their swords unsheathed but they were leaning on them while they watched the game	223.80031980046826
Athos seemed to grow calm as the critical moment approached	476.5478492544403
With his white aristocratic hands he played with the louis bending and straightening them again as if they were made of pewter	232.78640551375975
Aramis less selfcontrolled fumbled continually with his hidden poniard	447.2124588125913
Porthos impatient at his continued losses kept up a vigorous play with his knee	312.4964069254946
DArtagnan turned mechanically looking behind him and between the figures of two soldiers he could see Parry standing up and Charles leaning on his elbow with his hands clasped and apparently offering a fervent prayer to God	155.82530432787553
DArtagnan saw that the moment was come	82.56970810495108
He darted a preparatory glance at Athos and Aramis who slyly pushed their chairs a little back so as to leave themselves more space for action	310.8319116739372
He gave Porthos a second nudge of the knee and Porthos got up as if to stretch his legs and took care at the same time to ascertain that his sword could be drawn smoothly from the scabbard	113.72283363397605
Hang it cried DArtagnan another twenty pistoles lost	1759.3417858249898
Really Captain Groslow you are too much in fortunes way	252.71771170981341
This ca nt last and he drew another twenty from his pocket	57.468096696737895
One more turn captain twenty pistoles on one throwonly one the last	532.6835872957223
And he turned up two cards as usual a king for DArtagnan and an ace for himself	230.67336526328577
A king said DArtagnan its a good omen Master Groslowlook out for the king	844.3097504422444
And in spite of his extraordinary selfcontrol there was a strange vibration in the Gascons voice which made his partner start	296.0812174250885
Groslow began turning the cards one after another	337.05197930819355
If he turned up an ace first he won if a king he lost	482.08906458414856
At this word Athos and Aramis jumped up	417.00185528079624
Daggers and swords were just about to shine when suddenly the door was thrown open and Harrison appeared in the doorway accompanied by a man enveloped in a large cloak	71.15028028202173
Behind this man could be seen the glistening muskets of half a dozen soldiers	397.625492110131
Groslow jumped up ashamed at being surprised in the midst of wine cards and dice	304.23663000797006
But Harrison paid not the least attention to him and entering the kings room followed by his companion	44.96212555896476
Charles Stuart said he an order has come to conduct you to London without stopping day or night	173.12034216402097
Prepare yourself then to start at once	23.537616735282267
And by whom is this order given asked the king	250.681342782316
Mordaunt who has brought it and is charged with its execution	307.5177811174515
Mordaunt muttered the four friends exchanging glances	23363.280519743177
DArtagnan swept up the money that he and Porthos had lost and buried it in his huge pocket	233.83827673396834
Athos and Aramis placed themselves behind him	56.49108454017606
At this movement Mordaunt turned around recognized them and uttered an exclamation of savage delight	170.37817130530425
I m afraid we are prisoners whispered DArtagnan to his friend	502.3761719700745
Colonel colonel cried Mordaunt you are betrayed	82.39522732770737
These four Frenchmen have escaped from Newcastle and no doubt want to carry off the king	169.38028263972188
Ah my young man said DArtagnan drawing his sword that is an order sooner given than executed	406.768050985723
Fly friends fly he added whirling his sword around him	196.87873977182957
The next moment he darted to the door and knocked down two of the soldiers who guarded it before they had time to cock their muskets	121.04933081502048
Porthos brought up the rear and before soldiers officers or colonel had time to recover their surprise all four were in the street	329.8478505751041
Fire cried Mordaunt fire upon them	63.980747036082384
Three or four shots were fired but with no other result than to show the four fugitives turning the corner of the street safe and sound	140.42792192178473
The horses were at the place fixed upon and they leaped lightly into their saddles	320.3639209245895
Forward cried DArtagnan and spur for your dear lives	204.2524887186598
They galloped away and took the road they had come by in the morning namely in the direction toward Scotland	158.25479893884562
A few hundred yards beyond the town DArtagnan drew rein	1268.8059763259575
Halt he cried this time we shall be pursued	72.0276074168845
We must let them leave the village and ride after us on the northern road and when they have passed we will take the opposite direction	133.8668383384651
There was a stream close by and a bridge across it	473.98276461993305
DArtagnan led his horse under the arch of the bridge	119.71802418678408
Ten minutes later they heard the rapid gallop of a troop of horsemen	87.62684756154393
A few minutes more and the troop passed over their heads	93.13912412435546
As soon as the noise of the hoofs was lost in the distance DArtagnan remounted the bank of the stream and scoured the plain followed by his three friends directing their course as well as they could guess toward London	210.88816331086028
This time said DArtagnan when they were sufficiently distant to proceed at a trot I think all is lost and we have nothing better to do than to reach France	112.56055457068622
What do you say Athos to that proposition Is nt it reasonable	912.8800373296726
Yes dear friend Athos replied but you said a word the other day that was more than reasonableit was noble and generous	140.22641351034486
You said Let us die here I recall to you that word	68.39776707782748
Oh said Porthos death is nothing it is nt death that can disquiet us since we do nt know what it is	66.95542823929227
What troubles me is the idea of defeat	204.47558455048627
As things are turning out I foresee that we must give battle to London to the provinces to all England and certainly in the end we ca nt fail to be beaten	287.8183780645229
We ought to witness this great tragedy even to its last scene said Athos	576.0430303061503
Whatever happens let us not leave England before the crisis	823.1327830657538
Do nt you agree with me Aramis	263.2106951009293
Then too I confess I should not be sorry to come across Mordaunt again	209.6045996287551
It appears to me that we have an account to settle with him and that it is not our custom to leave a place without paying our debts of this kind at least	79.12415196899552
Ah that s another thing said DArtagnan and I should not mind waiting in London a whole year for a chance of meeting this Mordaunt in question	150.26440279926362
Only let us lodge with some one on whom we can count for I imagine just now that Noll Cromwell would not be inclined to trifle with us	190.86644468620645
Athos do you know any inn in the whole town where one can find white sheets roast beef reasonably cooked and wine which is not made of hops and gin	698.6133505511651
I think I know what you want replied Athos	196.9190767112395
De Winter took us to the house of a Spaniard who he said had become naturalized as an Englishman by the guineas of his new compatriots	177.098832887398
What do you say to it Aramis	4949.880440985686
Why the idea of taking quarters with Senor Perez seems to me very reasonable and for my part I agree to it	315.7385001587906
We will invoke the remembrance of that poor De Winter for whom he seemed to have a great regard we will tell him that we have come as amateurs to see what is going on we will spend with him a guinea each per day and I think that by taking all these precautions we can be quite undisturbed	122.08996191290429
You forget Aramis one precaution of considerable importance	531.4678110259831
The precaution of changing our clothes	443.44846929370357
I do nt see why we are very comfortable in those we wear	185.03163574036026
Our clothes have a cut which would proclaim the Frenchman at first sight	286.1402828081924
Now I do nt set sufficient store on the cut of my jerkin to risk being hung at Tyburn or sent for change of scene to the Indies	662.29009933912
I shall buy a chestnutcolored suit	11991.364254359045
I ve remarked that your Puritans revel in that color	1341.280730011786
But can you find your man said Aramis to Athos	652.1182099853291
He lives at the Bedford Tavern Greenhall Street	38606.845454785805
Besides I can find my way about the city with my eyes shut	149.308910843473
I wish we were already there said DArtagnan and my advice is that we reach London before daybreak even if we kill our horses	309.49022233569696
Come on then said Athos for unless I am mistaken in my calculations we have only eight or ten leagues to go	118.43854241397655
The friends urged on their horses and arrived in fact at about five oclock in the morning	24.69049573143694
They were stopped and questioned at the gate by which they sought to enter the city but Athos replied in excellent English that they had been sent forward by Colonel Harrison to announce to his colleague Monsieur Bridge the approach of the king	162.4089457692303
That reply led to several questions about the kings capture and Athos gave details so precise and positive that if the gatekeepers had any suspicions they vanished completely	715.3573481747426
The way was therefore opened to the four friends with all sorts of Puritan congratulations	134.24758627287832
He went direct to the Bedford Tavern and the host who recognized him was delighted to see him again with such a numerous and promising company	207.06450908169992
Though it was scarcely daylight our four travelers found the town in a great bustle owing to the reported approach of Harrison and the king	356.26938360656123
The plan of changing their clothes was unanimously adopted	2735.1434904351026
The landlord sent out for every description of garment as if he wanted to fit up his wardrobe	209.23041966545986
Athos chose a black coat which gave him the appearance of a respectable citizen	82.1438556914385
Aramis not wishing to part with his sword selected a darkblue cloak of a military cut	291.3554844468542
Porthos was seduced by a winecolored doublet and seagreen breeches	8614.759713144875
DArtagnan who had fixed on his color beforehand had only to select the shade and looked in his chestnut suit exactly like a retired sugar dealer	539.0059619513136
Now said DArtagnan for the actual man	1226.8158745740982
We must cut off our hair that the populace may not insult us	292.03126513915737
As we no longer wear the sword of the gentleman we may as well have the head of the Puritan	97.9767311479013
This as you know is the important point of distinction between the Covenanter and the Cavalier	435.5353325714527
After some discussion this was agreed to and Mousqueton played the role of barber	877.7797128644637
And smack of the Puritan to a frightful extent said Aramis	330.9612297556874
My head feels actually cold said Porthos	605.9050319771176
As for me I feel anxious to preach a sermon said DArtagnan	877.1969373535917
Now said Athos that we can not even recognize one another and have therefore no fear of others recognizing us let us go and see the kings entrance	129.46957000175234
They had not been long in the crowd before loud cries announced the kings arrival	271.40528212604175
A carriage had been sent to meet him and the gigantic Porthos who stood a head above the entire rabble soon announced that he saw the royal equipage approaching	200.88583051979487
DArtagnan raised himself on tiptoe and as the carriage passed saw Harrison at one window and Mordaunt at the other	183.58559916219937
The next day Athos leaning out of his window which looked upon the most populous part of the city heard the Act of Parliament which summoned the exking Charles I	161.67991054048477
Parliament can never have passed such an act as that	71.92701896371892
At this moment the landlord came in	96.47771949669956
Did parliament pass this act Athos asked of him in English	334.5479911282157
Yes my lord the pure parliament	5239.713311166907
What do you mean by the pure parliament Are there then two parliaments	659.1077824377019
My friend DArtagnan interrupted as I do nt understand English and we all understand Spanish have the kindness to speak to us in that language which since it is your own you must find pleasure in using when you have the chance	146.82916038088496
As to Porthos all his attention was concentrated on the allurements of the breakfast table	207.96073251056788
You were asking then said the host in Spanish	196.08420563284798
I asked said Athos in the same language if there are two parliaments a pure and an impure	151.13047471191055
Why how extraordinary said Porthos slowly raising his head and looking at his friends with an air of astonishment I understand English then I understand what you say	54.23558115223139
That is because we are talking Spanish my dear friend said Athos	150.97979582591273
Oh the devil said Porthos I am sorry for that it would have been one language more	74.03892734400121
When I speak of the pure parliament resumed the host I mean the one which Colonel Bridge has weeded	886.6499261754045
Ah really said DArtagnan these people are very ingenious	130.93295219616616
When I go back to France I must suggest some such convenient course to Cardinal Mazarin and the coadjutor	497.5716328140032
One of them will weed the parliament in the name of the court and the other in the name of the people and then there wo nt be any parliament at all	44.32871486181296
And who is this Colonel Bridge asked Aramis and how does he go to work to weed the parliament	384.718336240416
Colonel Bridge replied the Spaniard is a retired wagoner a man of much sense who made one valuable observation whilst driving his team namely that where there happened to be a stone on the road it was much easier to remove the stone than try and make the wheel pass over it	296.72160772836463
Now of two hundred and fiftyone members who composed the parliament there were one hundred and ninetyone who were in the way and might have upset his political wagon	346.7235130259468
He took them up just as he formerly used to take up the stones from the road and threw them out of the house	50.67914197707947
And all these one hundred and ninetyone were Royalists asked Athos	3699.050186134718
Without doubt senor and you understand that they would have saved the king	35.87604580641486
To be sure said Porthos with majestic common sense they were in the majority	315.597221581308
And you think said Aramis he will consent to appear before such a tribunal	174.05373115533885
He will be forced to do so smiled the Spaniard	196.24392229654995
Now Athos said DArtagnan do you begin to believe that its a ruined cause and that what with your Harrisons Joyces Bridges and Cromwells we shall never get the upper hand	316.39779738577795
The king will be delivered at the tribunal said Athos the very silence of his supporters indicates that they are at work	233.6301476840673
But said Aramis if they dare to condemn their king it can only be to exile or imprisonment	379.1001250528681
DArtagnan whistled a little air of incredulity	280.7076798902103
We shall see said Athos for we shall go to the sittings I presume	88.83241548418832
You will not have long to wait said the landlord they begin tomorrow	193.51396611028224
So then they drew up the indictments before the king was taken	148.96584445580416
Of course said DArtagnan they began the day he was sold	171.891519928574
And you know said Aramis that it was our friend Mordaunt who made if not the bargain at least the overtures	200.08336826615678
And you know added DArtagnan that whenever I catch him I will kill him this Mordaunt	159.8140162403582
Touching unanimity cried DArtagnan which well becomes good citizens like us	1740.549286294339
Let us take a turn around the town and imbibe a little fog	328.67743601422086
Yes said Porthos twill be at least a little change from beer	219.64723453338914
The next morning King Charles I	125.60634509069264
was haled by a strong guard before the high court which was to judge him	139.52857076965776
All London was crowding to the doors of the house	17.373586713239302
The throng was terrific and it was not till after much pushing and some fighting that our friends reached their destination	707.894377720923
When they did so they found the three lower rows of benches already occupied but being anxious not to be too conspicuous all with the exception of Porthos who had a fancy to display his red doublet were quite satisfied with their places the more so as chance had brought them to the centre of their row so that they were exactly opposite the armchair prepared for the royal prisoner	193.5059718304522
Toward eleven oclock the king entered the hall surrounded by guards but wearing his head covered and with a calm expression turned to every side with a look of complete assurance as if he were there to preside at an assembly of submissive subjects rather than to meet the accusations of a rebel court	181.09978471104515
The judges proud of having a monarch to humiliate evidently prepared to enjoy the right they had arrogated to themselves and sent an officer to inform the king that it was customary for the accused to uncover his head	305.98146290601755
Charles without replying a single word turned his head in another direction and pulled his felt hat over it	143.60657256931438
Then when the officer was gone he sat down in the armchair opposite the president and struck his boots with a little cane which he carried in his hand	37.73354931456255
Parry who accompanied him stood behind him	21.980318419745043
DArtagnan was looking at Athos whose face betrayed all those emotions which the king possessing more selfcontrol had banished from his own	281.7465636335946
This agitation in one so cold and calm as Athos frightened him	224.25196676238474
I hope he whispered to him that you will follow his majestys example and not get killed for your folly in this den	244.8901888492238
Set your mind at rest replied Athos	971.476965494235
Aha continued DArtagnan it is clear that they are afraid of something or other for look the sentinels are being reinforced	331.50291997512636
They had only halberds before now they have muskets	512.4738912810128
The halberds were for the audience in the rear the muskets are for us	271.95542824903316
Thirty forty fifty sixtyfive men said Porthos counting the reinforcements	1843.4623370885542
Ah said Aramis but you forget the officer	286.07421540090337
He recognized Mordaunt who with bare sword was marshalling the musketeers behind the king and opposite the benches	727.5189247826258
Do you think they have recognized us said DArtagnan	411.8289884986259
In that case I should beat a retreat	1519.1747953761565
I do nt care to be shot in a box	100.1705159884304
No said Aramis he has not seen us	29.689685067072226
He sees no one but the king	66.92322368712497
Mon Dieu how he stares at him the insolent dog Does he hate his majesty as much as he does us	238.8839479068927
Pardi answered Athos we only carried off his mother the king has spoiled him of his name and property	204.17392331730588
True said Aramis but silence the president is speaking to the king	91.43062773573583
Stuart Bradshaw was saying listen to the roll call of your judges and address to the court any observations you may have to make	139.3907811642386
The king turned his head away as if these words had not been intended for him	59.22690168342677
Bradshaw waited and as there was no reply there was a moment of silence	45.114313632966386
Out of the hundred and sixtythree members designated there were only seventythree present for the rest fearful of taking part in such an act had remained away	502.1336863033648
When the name of Colonel Fairfax was called one of those brief but solemn silences ensued which announced the absence of the members who had no wish to take a personal part in the trial	173.4924453957957
Fairfax answered a laughing voice the silvery tone of which betrayed it as that of a woman is not such a fool as to be here	87.20620729593055
A loud laugh followed these words pronounced with that boldness which women draw from their own weaknessa weakness which removes them beyond the power of vengeance	242.42759871469593
It is a womans voice cried Aramis faith I would give a good deal if she is young and pretty	168.8307170102826
And he mounted on the bench to try and get a sight of her	116.65600870803526
By my soul said Aramis she is charming	359.5051531147561
Look DArtagnan everybody is looking at her and in spite of Bradshaws gaze she has not turned pale	136.27307453614344
It is Lady Fairfax herself said DArtagnan	312.9034481180527
Do nt you remember Porthos we saw her at General Cromwells	562.4188516107087
These rascals will adjourn when they find that they are not in sufficient force said the Comte de la Fere	42.79217534763799
Is that the look of a man whose victim is likely to escape him Ah cursed basilisk it will be a happy day for me when I can cross something more than a look with you	112.95163767060713
The king is really very handsome said Porthos and look too though he is a prisoner how carefully he is dressed	166.34796765097443
The feather in his hat is worth at least fiveandtwenty pistoles	396.3156594850991
The roll call finished the president ordered them to read the act of accusation	203.48979697675003
A second time he was disappointed in his expectation	777.0871501606501
Notwithstanding the judges were so few the trial was to continue the king then was condemned in advance	275.180689868156
I told you so Athos said DArtagnan shrugging his shoulders	45.70650543904054
Now take your courage in both hands and hear what this gentleman in black is going to say about his sovereign with full license and privilege	177.50943401215798
Never till then had a more brutal accusation or meaner insults tarnished kingly majesty	9403.808984190058
Charles listened with marked attention passing over the insults noting the grievances and when hatred overflowed all bounds and the accuser turned executioner beforehand replying with a smile of lofty scorn	1053.903170934284
The fact is said DArtagnan if men are punished for imprudence and triviality this poor king deserves punishment	1223.2001390711453
But it seems to me that that which he is just now undergoing is hard enough	234.2731093924705
In any case Aramis replied the punishment should fall not on the king but on his ministers for the first article of the constitution is The king can do no wrong	197.0532390074251
As for me thought Porthos giving Mordaunt his whole attention were it not for breaking in on the majesty of the situation I would leap down from the bench reach Mordaunt in three bounds and strangle him I would then take him by the feet and knock the life out of these wretched musketeers who parody the musketeers of France	275.89677770262364
Meantime DArtagnan who is full of invention would find some way to save the king	86.79309635277241
I must speak to him about it	73.87587233210222
As to Athos his face aflame his fists clinched his lips bitten till they bled he sat there foaming with rage at that endless parliamentary insult and that long enduring royal patience the inflexible arm and steadfast heart had given place to a trembling hand and a body shaken by excitement	657.074382790068
At this moment the accuser concluded with these words The present accusation is preferred by us in the name of the English people	178.87574806919378
At these words there was a murmur along the benches and a second voice not that of a woman but a mans stout and furious thundered behind DArtagnan	384.9037945821815
Ninetenths of the English people are horrified at what you say	193.89379866705818
This voice was that of Athos who standing up with outstretched hand and quite out of his mind thus assailed the public accuser	294.6020366759548
King judges spectators all turned their eyes to the bench where the four friends were seated	68.40585841191702
Mordaunt did the same and recognized the gentleman around whom the three other Frenchmen were standing pale and menacing	346.84270886451884
He had discovered those to whose death he had devoted his life	129.44624762704385
A movement of fury called to his side some twenty of his musketeers and pointing to the bench where his enemies were Fire on that bench he cried	235.48533515777774
But with the rapidity of thought DArtagnan seized Athos by the waist and followed by Porthos with Aramis leaped down from the benches rushed into the passages and flying down the staircase were lost in the crowd without while the muskets within were pointed on some three thousand spectators whose piteous cries and noisy alarm stopped the impulse already given to bloodshed	283.54829464537266
Charles also had recognized the four Frenchmen	1702.090343668416
He put one hand on his heart to still its beating and the other over his eyes that he might not witness the slaying of his faithful friends	70.89006535931823
Mordaunt pale and trembling with anger rushed from the hall sword in hand followed by six pikemen pushing inquiring and panting in the crowd and then having found nothing returned	227.32371960531643
More than half an hour passed before any one could make himself heard	162.1517985613607
The judges were looking for a new outbreak from the benches	266.8931094498366
The spectators saw the muskets leveled at them and divided between fear and curiosity remained noisy and excited	607.5768693248133
What have you to say in your defense asked Bradshaw of the king	541.2447107857386
Then rising with his head still covered in the tone of a judge rather than a prisoner Charles began	129.4539777844203
Before questioning me he said reply to my question	225.6807017103227
I was free at Newcastle and had there concluded a treaty with both houses	445.1448545737271
Instead of performing your part of this contract as I performed mine you bought me from the Scotch cheaply I know and that does honor to the economic talent of your government	198.66574216041917
But because you have paid the price of a slave do you imagine that I have ceased to be your king No	67.25444777968778
To answer you would be to forget it	81.88068331070531
I shall only reply to you when you have satisfied me of your right to question me	48.45964423885322
To answer you would be to acknowledge you as my judges and I only acknowledge you as my executioners	179.473914917208
And in the middle of a deathlike silence Charles calm lofty and with his head still covered sat down again in his armchair	162.8568780174893
Why are not my Frenchmen here he murmured proudly and turning his eyes to the benches where they had appeared for a moment they would have seen that their friend was worthy of their defense while alive and of their tears when dead	97.8532845702207
Well said the president seeing that Charles was determined to remain silent so be it	291.5573947088176
We will judge you in spite of your silence	80.63414042508285
You are accused of treason of abuse of power and murder	299.00529086206694
Go and another sitting will accomplish what you have postponed in this	169.80823377175014
Charles rose and turned toward Parry whom he saw pale and with his temples dewed with moisture	301.72389763145947
Well my dear Parry said he what is the matter and what can affect you in this manner	47.486812342169706
Oh my king said Parry with tears in his eyes and in a tone of supplication do not look to the left as we leave the hall	52.22633089775298
Do not look I implore you my king	73.31021856737827
But what is the matter Speak said Charles attempting to look across the hedge of guards which surrounded him	371.81052764023127
It isbut you will not look will youit is because they have had the axe with which criminals are executed brought and placed there on the table	244.95937814056614
Fools said Charles do they take me for a coward like themselves You have done well to warn me	92.01119147583026
When the moment arrived the king followed his guards out of the hall	126.74638575849804
As he passed the table on which the axe was laid he stopped and turning with a smile said	102.00030209232776
Ah the axe an ingenious device and well worthy of those who know not what a gentleman is you frighten me not executioners axe added he touching it with the cane which he held in his hand and I strike you now waiting patiently and Christianly for you to return the blow	141.9627119268551
And shrugging his shoulders with unaffected contempt he passed on	358.5439780297026
When he reached the door a stream of people who had been disappointed in not being able to get into the house and to make amends had collected to see him come out stood on each side as he passed many among them glaring on him with threatening looks	144.59750358551537
How many people thought he and not one true friend	284.4330535893528
And as he uttered these words of doubt and depression within his mind a voice beside him said	136.9586800587961
The king turned quickly around with tears in his eyes and heart	26.400348138491285
It was an old soldier of the guards who could not see his king pass captive before him without rendering him this final homage	249.97265344472942
But the next moment the unfortunate man was nearly killed with heavy blows of swordhilts and among those who set upon him the king recognized Captain Groslow	342.51785284783347
Alas said Charles that is a severe chastisement for a very trifling fault	261.2822081999797
He continued his walk but he had scarcely gone a hundred paces when a furious fellow leaning between two soldiers spat in the kings face as once an infamous and accursed Jew spit in the face of Jesus of Nazareth	368.0511959730148
Loud roars of laughter and sullen murmurs arose together	5594.082526375398
The crowd opened and closed again undulating like a stormy sea and the king imagined that he saw shining in the midst of this living wave the bright eyes of Athos	150.65649119148634
Charles wiped his face and said with a sad smile Poor wretch for half a crown he would do as much to his own father	79.12723495371873
Athos and his friends again mingling with the throng were taking a last look at the martyr king	330.2266346696502
When the soldier saluted Charles Athoss heart bounded for joy and that unfortunate on coming to himself found ten guineas that the French gentleman had slipped into his pocket	356.75565762861754
But when the cowardly insulter spat in the face of the captive monarch Athos grasped his dagger	469.65478541650725
But DArtagnan stopped his hand and in a hoarse voice cried Wait	88.26110878485419
DArtagnan leaning on Athos made a sign to Porthos and Aramis to keep near them and then placed himself behind the man with the bare arms who was still laughing at his own vile pleasantry and receiving the congratulations of several others	119.09387620210188
The man took his way toward the city	66.23517029577971
The man who had the appearance of being a butcher descended a little steep and isolated street looking on to the river with two of his friends	196.76619224492453
Arrived at the bank of the river the three men perceived that they were followed turned around and looking insolently at the Frenchmen passed some jests from one to another	241.8394193795937
I do nt know English Athos said DArtagnan but you know it and will interpret for me	153.81760929796263
Then quickening their steps they passed the three men but turned back immediately and DArtagnan walked straight up to the butcher and touching him on the chest with the tip of his finger said to Athos	93.25774523812724
Say this to him in English You are a coward	143.30374778112943
You have insulted a defenseless man	5.245268020195806
You have befouled the face of your king	90.25159192404058
Athos pale as a ghost repeated these words to the man who seeing the bodeful preparations that were making put himself in an attitude of defense	260.68577130774383
Aramis at this movement drew his sword	49.7201822688017
And seizing the butcher by the throat	65.47131671489996
Porthos said he kill this fellow for me with a single blow	89.97450608337921
Porthos raised his terrible fist which whistled through the air like a sling and the portentous mass fell with a smothered crash on the insulters skull and crushed it	321.450913057296
The man fell like an ox beneath the poleaxe	127.95004845837535
His companions horrorstruck could neither move nor cry out	160.44986587415048
Tell them this Athos resumed DArtagnan thus shall all die who forget that a captive man is sacred and that a captive king doubly represents the Lord	566.5339470314786
The fellows looked at the body of their companion swimming in blood and then recovering voice and legs together ran screaming off	825.6568024842893
Justice is done said Porthos wiping his forehead	76.06720578176082
And now said DArtagnan to Athos entertain no further doubts about me I undertake all that concerns the king	588.0994750821036
The parliament condemned Charles to death as might have been foreseen	124.74713886825796
Political judgments are generally vain formalities for the same passions which give rise to the accusation ordain to the condemnation	213.71895138714885
Such is the atrocious logic of revolutions	573.5636910061786
Although our friends were expecting that condemnation it filled them with grief	429.7401626623566
DArtagnan whose mind was never more fertile in resources than in critical emergencies swore again that he would try all conceivable means to prevent the dnouement of the bloody tragedy	690.4837399492106
But by what means As yet he could form no definite plan all must depend on circumstances	453.3444674400553
Meanwhile it was necessary at all hazards in order to gain time to put some obstacle in the way of the execution on the following daythe day appointed by the judges	129.01165760726013
The only way of doing that was to cause the disappearance of the London executioner	193.70762055521794
The headsman out of the way the sentence could not be executed	132.19596644180461
True they could send for the headsman of the nearest town but at least a day would be gained and a day might be sufficient for the rescue	145.7371446057414
DArtagnan took upon himself that more than difficult task	708.0461452823474
Another thing not less essential was to warn Charles Stuart of the attempt to be made so that he might assist his rescuers as much as possible or at least do nothing to thwart their efforts	197.05107876055584
Charles Stuart had asked that Bishop Juxon might be permitted to visit him	470.7215814303005
Mordaunt had called on the bishop that very evening to apprise him of the religious desire expressed by the king and also of Cromwells permission	320.49329395475064
Aramis determined to obtain from the bishop through fear or by persuasion consent that he should enter in the bishops place and clad in his sacerdotal robes the prison at Whitehall	493.365047273746
Finally Athos undertook to provide in any event the means of leaving Englandin case either of failure or of success	463.7158712741306
The night having come they made an appointment to meet at eleven oclock at the hotel and each started out to fulfill his dangerous mission	147.73314484545278
The palace of Whitehall was guarded by three regiments of cavalry and by the fierce anxiety of Cromwell who came and went or sent his generals or his agents continually	347.7370917670248
Alone in his usual room lighted by two candles the condemned monarch gazed sadly on the luxury of his past greatness just as at the last hour one sees the images of life more mildly brilliant than of yore	414.7474309402946
Parry had not quitted his master and since his condemnation had not ceased to weep	85.96629942534535
Charles leaning on a table was gazing at a medallion of his wife and daughter he was waiting first for Juxon then for martyrdom	188.7293234329812
At times he thought of those brave French gentlemen who had appeared to him from a distance of a hundred leagues fabulous and unreal like the forms that appear in dreams	227.1705597969879
In fact he sometimes asked himself if all that was happening to him was not a dream or at least the delirium of a fever	81.2259068480398
He rose and took a few steps as if to rouse himself from his torpor and went as far as the window he saw glittering below him the muskets of the guards	94.17892876601162
He was thereupon constrained to admit that he was indeed awake and that his bloody dream was real	113.38358536119881
Charles returned in silence to his chair rested his elbow on the table bowed his head upon his hand and reflected	39.078237608597306
Alas he said to himself if I only had for a confessor one of those lights of the church whose soul has sounded all the mysteries of life all the littlenesses of greatness perhaps his utterance would overawe the voice that wails within my soul	264.3111587998237
But I shall have a priest of vulgar mind whose career and fortune I have ruined by my misfortune	271.2137251528225
He will speak to me of God and death as he has spoken to many another dying man not understanding that this one leaves his throne to an usurper his children to the cold contempt of public charity	228.695051123725
And he raised the medallion to his lips	30.81788923627292
It was a dull foggy night	7.108347911044599
A neighboring church clock slowly struck the hour	40.760649400060466
The flickering light of the two candles showed fitful phantom shadows in the lofty room	1315.253938551543
These were the ancestors of Charles standing back dimly in their tarnished frames	4454.595310443873
An awful sadness enveloped the heart of Charles	191.25521938150192
He buried his brow in his hands and thought of the world so beautiful when one is about to leave it of the caresses of children so pleasing and so sweet especially when one is parting from his children never to see them again then of his wife the noble and courageous woman who had sustained him to the last moment	120.42123648899359
He drew from his breast the diamond cross and the star of the Garter which she had sent him by those generous Frenchmen he kissed it and then as he reflected that she would never again see those things till he lay cold and mutilated in the tomb there passed over him one of those icy shivers which may be called forerunners of death	138.16892038289362
Then in that chamber which recalled to him so many royal souvenirs whither had come so many courtiers the scene of so much flattering homage alone with a despairing servant whose feeble soul could afford no support to his own the king at last yielded to sorrow and his courage sank to a level with that feebleness those shadows and that wintry cold	359.18815175241593
That king who was so grand so sublime in the hour of death meeting his fate with a smile of resignation on his lips now in that gloomy hour wiped away a tear which had fallen on the table and quivered on the gold embroidered cloth	114.97534702754798
Suddenly the door opened an ecclesiastic in episcopal robes entered followed by two guards to whom the king waved an imperious gesture	673.5032099369446
The guards retired the room resumed its obscurity	1759.9587794881043
Juxon cried Charles Juxon thank you my last friend you come at a fitting moment	106.87995821708378
The bishop looked anxiously at the man sobbing in the inglenook	381.2301056572512
Come Parry said the king cease your tears	2806.1779943104734
If its Parry said the bishop I have nothing to fear so allow me to salute your majesty and to tell you who I am and for what I am come	69.38860683994078
At this sight and this voice Charles was about to cry out when Aramis placed his finger on his lips and bowed low to the king of England	83.79793486688065
Yes sire interrupted Aramis raising his voice Bishop Juxon the faithful knight of Christ obedient to your majestys wishes	972.194936758483
Charles clasped his hands amazed and stupefied to find that these foreigners without other motive than that which their conscience imposed on them thus combated the will of a people and the destiny of a king	248.7627643142757
You he said you how did you penetrate hither If they recognize you you are lost	216.78532604414923
Care not for me sire think only of yourself	537.5631886040964
You see your friends are wakeful	160160.62471621166
I know not what we shall do yet but four determined men can do much	471.46447688249077
Meanwhile do not be surprised at anything that happens prepare yourself for every emergency	936.606907766563
Do you know that I die tomorrow at ten oclock	71.77060565668702
Something your majesty will happen between now and then to make the execution impossible	174.15470806288786
The king looked at Aramis with astonishment	27.508438762586405
At this moment a strange noise like the unloading of a cart and followed by a cry of pain was heard beneath the window	38.291454151730186
Do you hear said the king	404.53180832711865
I hear said Aramis but I understand neither the noise nor the cry of pain	70.78021520973675
I know not who can have uttered the cry said the king but the noise is easily understood	102.68500807719737
Do you know that I am to be beheaded outside this window Well these boards you hear unloaded are the posts and planks to build my scaffold	967.5939614572459
Some workmen must have fallen underneath them and been hurt	1123.6931679033275
Aramis shuddered in spite of himself	341.04601915860826
You see said the king that it is useless for you to resist	41.550332543815045
I am condemned leave me to my death	44.853535904994935
My king said Aramis they well may raise a scaffold but they can not make an executioner	194.48949716785557
What do you mean asked the king	40.33300107762153
I mean that at this hour the headsman has been got out of the way by force or persuasion	100.19692772811382
The scaffold will be ready by tomorrow but the headsman will be wanting and they will put it off till the day after tomorrow	66.10324283662867
Tomorrow night we shall rescue you	17.087943975824746
How can that be cried the king whose face was lighted up in spite of himself by a flash of joy	68.90888959443463
Oh sir cried Parry may you and yours be blessed	400.60736794558653
How can it be repeated the king	42.03134287374429
I must know so that I may assist you if there is any chance	35.049040266028705
I know nothing about it continued Aramis but the cleverest the bravest the most devoted of us four said to me when I left him Tell the king that tomorrow at ten oclock at night we shall carry him off	138.77364395022383
He has said it and will do it	69.4614228848077
Tell me the name of that generous friend said the king that I may cherish for him an eternal gratitude whether he succeeds or not	336.8584088093083
DArtagnan sire the same who had so nearly rescued you when Colonel Harrison made his untimely entrance	722.5574922516229
You are indeed wonderful men said the king if such things had been related to me I should not have believed them	48.64768738421955
Now sire resumed Aramis listen to me	8.291797722056199
Do not forget for a single instant that we are watching over your safety observe the smallest gesture the least bit of song the least sign from any one near you watch everything hear everything interpret everything	411.7009459724856
Oh chevalier cried the king what can I say to you There is no word though it should come from the profoundest depth of my heart that can express my gratitude	123.2900517560357
If you succeed I do not say that you will save a king no in presence of the scaffold as I am royalty I assure you is a very small affair but you will save a husband to his wife a father to his children	81.03897159198402
Chevalier take my hand it is that of a friend who will love you to his last sigh	62.940966890203065
Aramis stooped to kiss the kings hand but Charles clasped his and pressed it to his heart	144.70626146143616
At this moment a man entered without even knocking at the door	114.07296718860961
Aramis tried to withdraw his hand but the king still held it	134.65661029137877
The man was one of those Puritans half preacher and half soldier who swarmed around Cromwell	2830.236588258964
What do you want sir said the king	23.586497607994087
I desire to know if the confession of Charles Stuart is at an end said the stranger	167.46435688079706
And what is it to you replied the king we are not of the same religion	73.49130704904798
All men are brothers said the Puritan	298.00683860294544
One of my brothers is about to die and I come to prepare him	37.60818016525012
Bear with him whispered Aramis it is doubtless some spy	220.368848123862
After my reverend lord bishop said the king to the man I shall hear you with pleasure sir	51.492827036979236
The man retired but not before examining the supposed Juxon with an attention which did not escape the king	261.970233422584
Chevalier said the king when the door was closed I believe you are right and that this man only came here with evil intentions	65.60577419257108
Take care that no misfortune befalls you when you leave	311.613418779878
I thank your majesty said Aramis but under these robes I have a coat of mail a pistol and a dagger	210.82509771063135
Go then sir and God keep you	24.08312247495318
The king accompanied him to the door where Aramis pronounced his benediction upon him and passing through the anterooms filled with soldiers jumped into his carriage and drove to the bishops palace	153.4504987828203
Juxon was waiting for him impatiently	7733.875125991771
Well said he on perceiving Aramis	31206.658501144295
Everything has succeeded as I expected spies guards satellites all took me for you and the king blesses you while waiting for you to bless him	382.4981377851543
May God protect you my son for your example has given me at the same time hope and courage	78.81727708717966
Aramis resumed his own attire and left Juxon with the assurance that he might again have recourse to him	87.56351139406819
He had scarcely gone ten yards in the street when he perceived that he was followed by a man wrapped in a large cloak	28.257417481752544
He placed his hand on his dagger and stopped	106.50464447384861
The man came straight toward him	7.949707516069793
You see we had each our mission said Porthos mine was to guard you and I am doing so	176.85686880942765
We are to meet our friends at the hotel at eleven	49.73080774438241
It was then striking halfpast ten by St	1121.1538319667118
Arrived at the hotel it was not long before Athos entered	241.9353875263738
Alls well he cried as he entered I have hired a cedar wherry as light as a canoe as easy on the wing as any swallow	569.7123566097453
It is waiting for us at Greenwich opposite the Isle of Dogs manned by a captain and four men who for the sum of fifty pounds sterling will keep themselves at our disposition three successive nights	307.895987351194
Once on board we drop down the Thames and in two hours are on the open sea	109.9525674214326
In case I am killed the captains name is Roger and the skiff is called the Lightning	482.5920411929086
A handkerchief tied at the four corners is to be the signal	295.17245387588065
Empty your pockets said he I want a hundred pounds and as for my own and he emptied them inside out	124.3317545366438
The sum was collected in a minute	34.05830696268827
DArtagnan ran out and returned directly after	3917.875026988551
Ough and not without a deal of trouble too	468.6473828445811
Has the executioner left London asked Athos	304.69208235160716
Ah you see that plan was not sure enough he might go out by one gate and return by another	105.37558243353766
Mousqueton is propped against the door and heres the key	245.24892192653056
Bravo said Aramis how did you manage it	17.24055947788639
Like everything else with money but it cost me dear	139.46845007300337
And where did you get so much money said Athos	121.44291220601193
The queens famous diamond answered DArtagnan with a sigh	26.32036582948846
I recognized it on your finger	303.5945205118802
You bought it back then from Monsieur des Essarts asked Porthos	786.131961870068
Yes but it was fated that I should not keep it	38.21357887393867
So then we are all right as regards the executioner said Athos but unfortunately every executioner has his assistant his man or whatever you call him	395.200330046912
And this one had his said DArtagnan but as good luck would have it just as I thought I should have two affairs to manage our friend was brought home with a broken leg	188.54558345882484
In the excess of his zeal he had accompanied the cart containing the scaffolding as far as the kings window and one of the crossbeams fell on his leg and broke it	147.37529564302068
Ah cried Aramis that accounts for the cry I heard	69.4552326985667
Probably said DArtagnan but as he is a thoughtful young man he promised to send four expert workmen in his place to help those already at the scaffold and wrote the moment he was brought home to Master Tom Lowe an assistant carpenter and friend of his to go down to Whitehall with three of his friends	251.93887877811937
Heres the letter he sent by a messenger for sixpence who sold it to me for a guinea	167.99975508134168
And what on earth are you going to do with it asked Athos	29.551684766128012
Ca nt you guess my dear Athos You who speak English like John Bull himself are Master Tom Lowe we your three companions	1906.2020288411147
Athos uttered a cry of joy and admiration ran to a closet and drew forth workmens clothes which the four friends immediately put on they then left the hotel Athos carrying a saw Porthos a vise Aramis an axe and DArtagnan a hammer and some nails	397.8532446111748
The letter from the executioners assistant satisfied the master carpenter that those were the men he expected	666.9142298584899
Toward midnight Charles heard a great noise beneath his window	74.45369746045523
It arose from blows of hammer and hatchet clinking of pincers and cranching of saws	1669.4947388728442
Lying dressed upon his bed the noise awoke him with a start and found a gloomy echo in his heart	112.19621024794003
He could not endure it and sent Parry to ask the sentinel to beg the workmen to strike more gently and not disturb the last slumber of one who had been their king	218.19480337775354
The sentinel was unwilling to leave his post but allowed Parry to pass	291.48090601769405
Arriving at the window Parry found an unfinished scaffold over which they were nailing a covering of black serge	665.0495994806575
Raised to the height of twenty feet so as to be on a level with the window it had two lower stories	133.53533588709035
Parry odious as was this sight to him sought for those among some eight or ten workmen who were making the most noise and fixed on two men who were loosening the last hooks of the iron balcony	176.5123576270474
My friends said Parry mounting the scaffold and standing beside them would you work a little more quietly The king wishes to get a sleep	287.4465867150367
One of the two who was standing up was of gigantic size and was driving a pick with all his might into the wall whilst the other kneeling beside him was collecting the pieces of stone	221.5843635997371
The face of the first was lost to Parry in the darkness but as the second turned around and placed his finger on his lips Parry started back in amazement	99.76893121686847
Very well very well said the workman aloud in excellent English	1460.6203243996713
Tell the king that if he sleeps badly tonight he will sleep better tomorrow night	591.7263130902111
These blunt words so terrible if taken literally were received by the other workmen with a roar of laughter	453.6717943933196
But Parry withdrew thinking he was dreaming	815.1498828322108
Charles was impatiently awaiting his return	619.6258153691489
At the moment he reentered the sentinel who guarded the door put his head through the opening curious as to what the king was doing	108.26170972988525
The king was lying on his bed resting on his elbow	18.61808388715513
Parry closed the door and approaching the king his face radiant with joy	228.86612101894156
Sire he said in a low voice do you know who these workmen are who are making so much noise	59.969434424226016
I No how would you have me know	126.10885313101653
Parry bent his head and whispered to the king It is the Comte de la Fere and his friends	51.433689616015165
Raising my scaffold cried the king astounded	16486.41294014619
Yes and at the same time making a hole in the wall	24.416770157001903
The king clasped his hands and raised his eyes to Heaven then leaping down from his bed he went to the window and pulling aside the curtain tried to distinguish the figures outside but in vain	63.66528696612336
It was Athos he had recognized and Porthos who was boring a hole through the wall	128.04418768779453
This hole communicated with a kind of loftthe space between the floor of the kings room and the ceiling of the one below it	82.80998414759517
Their plan was to pass through the hole they were making into this loft and cut out from below a piece of the flooring of the kings room so as to form a kind of trapdoor	99.06348272791648
Through this the king was to escape the next night and hidden by the black covering of the scaffold was to change his dress for that of a workman slip out with his deliverers pass the sentinels who would suspect nothing and so reach the skiff that was waiting for him at Greenwich	176.37298788756985
Day gilded the tops of the houses	56.26696622469792
The aperture was finished and Athos passed through it carrying the clothes destined for the king wrapped in black cloth and the tools with which he was to open a communication with the kings room	132.79388867617354
He had only two hours work to do to open communication with the king and according to the calculations of the four friends they had the entire day before them since the executioner being absent another must be sent for to Bristol	140.93280862327268
DArtagnan returned to change his workmans clothes for his chestnutcolored suit and Porthos to put on his red doublet	414.09107195932035
As for Aramis he went off to the bishops palace to see if he could possibly pass in with Juxon to the kings presence	175.5768075042271
All three agreed to meet at noon in Whitehall Place to see how things went on	494.02001392447625
Before leaving the scaffold Aramis had approached the opening where Athos was concealed to tell him that he was about to make an attempt to gain another interview with the king	69.57352635735651
Adieu then and be of good courage said Athos	294.1173378369942
Report to the king the condition of affairs	272.46766986762555
Say to him that when he is alone it will help us if he will knock on the floor for then I can continue my work in safety	82.79880840144997
Try Aramis to keep near the king	88.28709781812499
Speak loud very loud for they will be listening at the door	42.84263439878135
If there is a sentinel within the apartment kill him without hesitation	525.0113779704684
If there are two let Parry kill one and you the other	222.3381519432302
If there are three let yourself be slain but save the king	212.34758715654502
Be easy said Aramis I will take two poniards and give one to Parry	285.94964640654945
Yes go but urge the king strongly not to stand on false generosity	748.4933596464709
While you are fighting if there is a fight he must flee	256.12618593857366
The trap once replaced over his head you being on the trap dead or alive they will need at least ten minutes to find the hole by which he has escaped	92.01078877280962
In those ten minutes we shall have gained the road and the king will be saved	61.838186742890855
Everything shall be done as you say Athos	143.51394010161894
Your hand for perhaps we shall not see each other again	25.94956573943195
Athos put his arm around Aramiss neck and embraced him	556.4673947538367
Now if I die say to DArtagnan that I love him as a son and embrace him for me	100.03307626352421
Embrace also our good and brave Porthos	5321.891805725727
I am as sure now that the king will be saved as I am sure that I clasp the most loyal hand in the world	61.507758568982155
Aramis parted from Athos went down from the scaffold in his turn and took his way to the hotel whistling the air of a song in praise of Cromwell	67.03779027796249
He found the other two friends sitting at table before a good fire drinking a bottle of port and devouring a cold chicken	262.3932750276597
Porthos was cursing the infamous parliamentarians DArtagnan ate in silence revolving in his mind the most audacious plans	1120.4495566889857
Aramis related what had been agreed upon	849.269172472917
DArtagnan approved with a movement of the head and Porthos with his voice	56.125788201010394
Bravo he said besides we shall be there at the time of the flight	22.461935365903116
What with DArtagnan Grimaud and Mousqueton we can manage to dispatch eight of them	819.3629443205119
I say nothing about Blaisois for he is only fit to hold the horses	97.19843621259933
Two minutes a man makes four minutes	273.61173381067823
Mousqueton will lose another that s five and in five minutes we shall have galloped a quarter of a league	63.044306808512836
Aramis swallowed a hasty mouthful gulped a glass of wine and changed his clothes	86.37772356834259
Now said he I m off to the bishops	628.021150716861
Take care of the executioner DArtagnan	19337.223887710607
Grimaud has relieved Mousqueton and has his foot on the cellar door	143.2811932249234
Inactive my dear fellow Ask Porthos	5432.12788664506
I pass my life upon my legs	46.358100208941266
Aramis again presented himself at the bishops	276.06130557856164
Juxon consented the more readily to take him with him as he would require an assistant priest in case the king should wish to communicate	111.60916980535923
Dressed as Aramis had been the night before the bishop got into his carriage and the former more disguised by his pallor and sad countenance than his deacons dress got in by his side	185.51455337060176
The carriage stopped at the door of the palace	8.523902265138817
It was about nine oclock in the morning	2.179995771523349
The anterooms were still full of soldiers the passages still lined by guards	664.8273479941306
The king was already sanguine but when he perceived Aramis his hope turned to joy	374.17474088845125
He embraced Juxon and pressed the hand of Aramis	54.446240972726834
The bishop affected to speak in a loud voice before every one of their previous interview	94.16265157219134
The king replied that the words spoken in that interview had borne their fruit and that he desired another under the same conditions	308.2380434836601
Juxon turned to those present and begged them to leave him and his assistant alone with the king	89.26360589805653
As soon as the door was closed	6.565985659990521
Sire said Aramis speaking rapidly you are saved the London executioner has vanished	366.7236647267624
His assistant broke his leg last night beneath your majestys windowthe cry we heard was hisand there is no executioner nearer at hand than Bristol	1052.3609164386778
But the Comte de la Fere asked the king	93.70179009487146
Two feet below you take the poker from the fireplace and strike three times on the floor	111.43114104537771
The king did so and the moment after three muffled knocks answering the given signal sounded beneath the floor	966.5972960786341
So said Charles he who knocks down there	4528.39246638336
Is the Comte de la Fere sire said Aramis	321.08070674800393
He is preparing a way for your majesty to escape	67.92037786334757
Parry for his part will raise this slab of marble and a passage will be opened	262.62959782165854
Oh Juxon said the king seizing the bishops two hands in his own promise that you will pray all your life for this gentleman and for the other that you hear beneath your feet and for two others also who wherever they may be are on the watch for my safety	158.06286083901065
Sire replied Juxon you shall be obeyed	134.15088580188927
Meanwhile the miner underneath was heard working away incessantly when suddenly an unexpected noise resounded in the passage	196.45631880236365
Aramis seized the poker and gave the signal to stop the noise came nearer and nearer	106.97613409925691
It was that of a number of men steadily approaching	797.9942887183812
All eyes were fixed on the door which opened slowly and with a kind of solemnity	29.74819365973529
A parliamentary officer clothed in black and with a gravity that augured ill entered bowed to the king and unfolding a parchment read the sentence as is usually done to criminals before their execution	520.1315043767186
What is this said Aramis to Juxon	2552.359871929775
Juxon replied with a sign which meant that he knew no more than Aramis about it	75.69104710260594
Then it is for today asked the king	58.95689742067194
Was not your majesty warned that it was to take place this morning	18.093623962326504
Then I must die like a common criminal by the hand of the London executioner	146.71986911635196
The London executioner has disappeared your majesty but a man has offered his services instead	175.56022965825676
The execution will therefore only be delayed long enough for you to arrange your spiritual and temporal affairs	448.49778996279167
A slight moisture on his brow was the only trace of emotion that Charles evinced as he learned these tidings	209.25945997671016
His heart ceased beating he closed his eyes and leaned upon the table	19.796066846733993
Charles perceived it and took his hand	11.154346395103925
Come my friend said he courage	17724.487658898324
Then he turned to the officer	1085.9034776817577
There is but little reason why I should delay you	64.90137436636635
Firstly I wish to communicate secondly to embrace my children and bid them farewell for the last time	190.66580307376177
Certainly replied the officer and left the room	18.540645321604075
Aramis dug his nails into his flesh and groaned aloud	167.2289820432488
Oh my lord bishop he cried seizing Juxons hands where is Providence where is Providence	731.1765096524953
My son replied the bishop with firmness you see Him not because the passions of the world conceal Him	517.9582520600394
My son said the king to Aramis do not take it so to heart	125.5631391663953
You ask what God is doing	628.9128002556271
God beholds your devotion and my martyrdom and believe me both will have their reward	311.33434535780145
Ascribe to men then what is happening and not to God	265.5466170819161
It is men who drive me to death it is men who make you weep	77.07461035742188
Yes sire said Aramis yes you are right	3.3253354312570735
It is men whom I should hold responsible and I will hold them responsible	208.61954259407273
Be seated Juxon said the king falling upon his knees	86.43033491065118
I have now to confess to you	9.212600015821874
Remain sir he added to Aramis who had moved to leave the room	77.9668537081942
I have nothing to say that can not be said before all	53.83656252211981
Juxon sat down and the king kneeling humbly before him began his confession	1209.7359852254256
The mob had already assembled when the confession terminated	1488.820348522432
The kings children next arrivedthe Princess Charlotte a beautiful fairhaired child with tears in her eyes and the Duke of Gloucester a boy eight or nine years old whose tearless eyes and curling lip revealed a growing pride	370.4062162924223
He had wept all night long but would not show his grief before the people	154.52668757293148
Charless heart melted within him at the sight of those two children whom he had not seen for two years and whom he now met at the moment of death	27.165107799745908
He turned to brush away a tear and then summoning up all his firmness drew his daughter toward him recommending her to be pious and resigned	240.76831120867078
Then he took the boy upon his knee	65.12008929583145
My son he said to him you saw a great number of people in the streets as you came here	75.3021295693989
These men are going to behead your father	363.46741347831653
Perhaps some day they will want to make you king instead of the Prince of Wales or the Duke of York your elder brothers	206.41389067788592
But you are not the king my son and can never be so while they are alive	83.58538548314776
Swear to me then never to let them put a crown upon your head unless you have a legal right to the crown	109.211084490331
For one daylisten my sonone day if you do so they will doom you to destruction head and crown too and then you will not be able to die with a calm conscience as I die	84.41811371881191
The child stretched out his little hand toward that of his father and said I swear to your majesty	78.06766585037192
Henry said Charles call me your father	26.975579878242723
Father replied the child I swear to you that they shall kill me sooner than make me king	70.64200685099948
Now kiss me and you too Charlotte	13184.272595968672
Oh never never cried both the children throwing their arms around their fathers neck	108.04433890425547
Farewell said Charles farewell my children	1644.662711604164
Take them away Juxon their tears will deprive me of the courage to die	55.22306803504873
Juxon led them away and this time the doors were left open	75.88896738033293
Meanwhile Athos in his concealment waited in vain the signal to recommence his work	273.37420356821235
Two long hours he waited in terrible inaction	2624.3117023433397
A deathlike silence reigned in the room above	33.83689341100251
At last he determined to discover the cause of this stillness	116.02260225123737
He crept from his hole and stood hidden by the black drapery beneath the scaffold	83.22912524778397
Peeping out from the drapery he could see the rows of halberdiers and musketeers around the scaffold and the first ranks of the populace swaying and groaning like the sea	196.910424991534
What is the matter then he asked himself trembling more than the windswayed cloth he was holding back	157.54828002397048
The people are hurrying on the soldiers under arms and among the spectators I see DArtagnan	323.42947155366335
What is he waiting for What is he looking at Good God have they allowed the headsman to escape	318.5798015995493
Suddenly the dull beating of muffled drums filled the square	1965.1485064103479
The sound of heavy steps was heard above his head	16.29322936652295
The next moment the very planks of the scaffold creaked with the weight of an advancing procession and the eager faces of the spectators confirmed what a last hope at the bottom of his heart had prevented him till then believing	122.07546942776797
At the same moment a wellknown voice above him pronounced these words	223.60421170606642
Colonel I want to speak to the people	25.839278213115332
Athos shuddered from head to foot	44.455848862182904
It was the king speaking on the scaffold	107.85340032102901
In fact after taking a few drops of wine and a piece of bread Charles weary of waiting for death had suddenly decided to go to meet it and had given the signal for movement	96.25070148498918
Then the two wings of the window facing the square had been thrown open and the people had seen silently advancing from the interior of the vast chamber first a masked man who carrying an axe in his hand was recognized as the executioner	123.38852796219139
He approached the block and laid his axe upon it	273.41362430725326
Behind him pale indeed but marching with a firm step was Charles Stuart who advanced between two priests followed by a few superior officers appointed to preside at the execution and attended by two files of partisans who took their places on opposite sides of the scaffold	296.1540343851673
The sight of the masked man gave rise to a prolonged sensation	267.9177518230657
Every one was full of curiosity as to who that unknown executioner could be who presented himself so opportunely to assure to the people the promised spectacle when the people believed it had been postponed until the following day	271.6694686163524
But they could discern nothing but a man of middle height dressed in black apparently of a certain age for the end of a gray beard peeped out from the bottom of the mask that hid his features	117.72000672961312
The kings request had undoubtedly been acceded to by an affirmative sign for in firm sonorous accents which vibrated in the depths of Athoss heart the king began his speech explaining his conduct and counseling the welfare of the kingdom	291.63691846057753
Oh said Athos to himself is it indeed possible that I hear what I hear and that I see what I see Is it possible that God has abandoned His representative on earth and left him to die thus miserably And I have not seen him I have not said adieu to him	95.74536888988216
A noise was heard like that the instrument of death would make if moved upon the block	180.5100968713426
Do not touch the axe said the king and resumed his speech	75.63418173027735
At the end of his speech the king looked tenderly around upon the people	338.01512153669944
Then unfastening the diamond ornament which the queen had sent him he placed it in the hands of the priest who accompanied Juxon	48.236499604877906
Then he drew from his breast a little cross set in diamonds which like the order had been the gift of Henrietta Maria	196.90014911897956
Sir said he to the priest I shall keep this cross in my hand till the last moment	64.34051060957361
Take it from me when I amdead	1768.882728239183
Yes sire said a voice which Athos recognized as that of Aramis	202.26521486592327
He then took his hat from his head and threw it on the ground	8.902600792841092
One by one he undid the buttons of his doublet took it off and deposited it by the side of his hat	40.81089812069755
Then as it was cold he asked for his gown which was brought to him	41.41999075534344
All the preparations were made with a frightful calmness	49.674238789239396
One would have thought the king was going to bed and not to his coffin	72.89038067044358
Will these be in your way he said to the executioner raising his long locks if so they can be tied up	137.75142624558455
Charles accompanied these words with a look designed to penetrate the mask of the unknown headsman	242.926846503465
His calm noble gaze forced the man to turn away his head	37.994996982568715
But after the searching look of the king he encountered the burning eyes of Aramis	125.39301787926968
The king seeing that he did not reply repeated his question	78.69135952328416
It will do replied the man in a tremulous voice if you separate them across the neck	104.92650279459791
The king parted his hair with his hands and looking at the block he said	29.67790712547685
This block is very low is there no other to be had	129.94066583773565
It is the usual block answered the man in the mask	117.24297028423555
Do you think you can behead me with a single blow asked the king	145.87888673905275
I hope so was the reply	441.31919407843594
There was something so strange in these three words that everybody except the king shuddered	311.91241890509747
I do not wish to be taken by surprise added the king	145.2501186280619
I shall kneel down to pray do not strike then	249.13974256492978
When I shall lay my head on the block and say Remember then strike boldly	1067.510856083469
Gentlemen said the king to those around him I leave you to brave the tempest I go before you to a kingdom which knows no storms	240.0845160534
He looked at Aramis and made a special sign to him with his head	39.46306285674471
Now he continued withdraw a little and let me say my prayer I beseech you	97.67415610106764
You also stand aside he said to the masked man	44.932035838773466
It is only for a moment and I know that I belong to you but remember that you are not to strike till I give the signal	34.93422236728221
Then he knelt down made the sign of the cross and lowering his face to the planks as if he would have kissed them said in a low tone in French Comte de la Fere are you there	49.92818698683247
Yes your majesty he answered trembling	18691.693441629715
Faithful friend noble heart said the king I should not have been rescued	37.71460858554341
I have addressed my people and I have spoken to God last of all I speak to you	68.42753464201232
To maintain a cause which I believed sacred I have lost the throne and my children their inheritance	226.660236088262
A million in gold remains it is buried in the cellars of Newcastle Keep	282.2473826724716
You only know that this money exists	3659.397540058708
Make use of it then whenever you think it will be most useful for my eldest sons welfare	265.56885933565763
Farewell saintly martyred majesty lisped Athos chilled with terror	439.7809009158249
A moments silence ensued and then in a full sonorous voice the king exclaimed Remember	294.95782859796384
He had scarcely uttered the word when a heavy blow shook the scaffold and where Athos stood immovable a warm drop fell upon his brow	215.25268322210832
He reeled back with a shudder and the same moment the drops became a crimson cataract	420.9608767374465
Athos fell on his knees and remained some minutes as if bewildered or stunned	370.17664053681
At last he rose and taking his handkerchief steeped it in the blood of the martyred king	172.84982661207783
Then as the crowd gradually dispersed he leaped down crept from behind the drapery glided between two horses mingled with the crowd and was the first to arrive at the inn	97.24183211696278
Having gained his room he raised his hand to his face and observing that his fingers were covered with the monarchs blood fell down insensible	86.52740085782555
The snow was falling thick and icy	90.44429700651817
Aramis was the next to come in and to discover Athos almost insensible	973.7661348906006
But at the first words he uttered the comte roused himself from the kind of lethargy in which he had sunk	123.68818512993887
Well said Aramis beaten by fate	19444.647342857672
Where you left meunder the scaffold	5504.9099486318855
God preserve me from another such hour as I have just passed	119.72499785284194
Then you know that I did not leave him	14.654187109364916
I heard your voice up to the last moment	29.07838420654492
Here is the order he gave me and the cross I took from his hand he desired they should be returned to the queen	122.86411950745874
Then here is a handkerchief to wrap them in replied Athos drawing from his pocket the one he had steeped in the kings blood	255.18418557377433
And what he continued has been done with the poor body	52.12888960450153
By order of Cromwell royal honors will be accorded to it	180.56154054142408
The doctors are embalming the corpse and when it is ready it will be placed in a lighted chapel	110.1052689405871
Mockery muttered Athos savagely royal honors to one whom they have murdered	250.74854963609172
Well cheer up said a loud voice from the staircase which Porthos had just mounted	82.50371156791346
We are all mortal my poor friends	90.4709211896068
You are late my dear Porthos	30778.769257215692
Yes there were some people on the way who delayed me	170.19723379054528
I took one of them by the throat and threequarters throttled him	263.8571017456856
Just then a patrol rode up	17.80027327960601
Luckily the man I had had most to do with was some minutes before he could speak so I took advantage of his silence to walk off	111.92459379054961
We got separated in the crowd and I could not find him again	35.99980522801642
Oh said Athos satirically I saw him	56.223216510481976
He was in the front row of the crowd admirably placed for seeing and as on the whole the sight was curious he probably wished to stay to the end	190.6604270797216
Ah Comte de la Fere said a calm voice though hoarse with running is it your habit to calumniate the absent	389.5398150780308
This reproof stung Athos to the heart but as the impression produced by seeing DArtagnan foremost in a coarse ferocious crowd had been very strong he contented himself with replying	313.46142933386074
I am not calumniating you my friend	42.1557727186728
They were anxious about you here I simply told them where you were	159.51239092809618
You did nt know King Charles to you he was only a foreigner and you were not obliged to love him	75.42951910477274
So saying he stretched out his hand but the other pretended not to see it and he let it drop again slowly by his side	87.44925832969561
Ugh I am tired cried DArtagnan sitting down	830.5277614673647
Drink a glass of port said Aramis it will refresh you	175.478946490309
Yes let us drink said Athos anxious to make it up by hobnobbing with DArtagnan let us drink and get away from this hateful country	230.3502412172683
The felucca is waiting for us you know let us leave tonight we have nothing more to do here	50.42936902777402
You are in a hurry sir count said DArtagnan	587.292417662667
But what would you have us to do here now that the king is dead	63.41054452862108
Go sir count replied DArtagnan carelessly you see nothing to keep you a little longer in England Well for my part I a bloodthirsty ruffian who can go and stand close to a scaffold in order to have a better view of the kings executionI remain	160.24641948772123
Every reproach his friend uttered struck deeply in his heart	82.65559618041861
Ah you remain in London said Porthos	129.86467244608954
Hang it said Porthos a little perplexed between the two I suppose as I came with you I must go away with you	87.69574351562746
I ca nt leave you alone in this abominable country	177.57499120776836
So I have a little adventure to propose to you when the count is gone	70.12437492763398
I want to find out who was the man in the mask who so obligingly offered to cut the kings throat	197.29336447399004
A man in a mask cried Athos	1851.28212485076
You did not let the executioner escape then	666.0921127059502
The executioner is still in the cellar where I presume he has had an interview with mine hosts bottles	365.7663522707094
Sir answered a voice from the depths of the earth	16.305533652109567
But said Athos who is the wretch that has dared to raise his hand against his king	115.29431514873949
An amateur headsman replied Aramis who however does not handle the axe amiss	838.8699732564104
Did you not see his face asked Athos	418.4556317153301
But you Aramis who were close to him	68.5621617353241
I could see nothing but a gray beard under the fringe of the mask	132.52765735400845
Then it must be a man of a certain age	83.41160520226717
Oh said DArtagnan that matters little	2176.186772528498
When one puts on a mask it is not difficult to wear a beard under it	119.22247473939719
I am sorry I did not follow him said Porthos	73.46701508695128
Well my dear Porthos said DArtagnan that s the very thing it came into my head to do	95.17876869607173
I have distrusted God I could the more easily distrust you	469.30147022802134
We will see about that presently said DArtagnan with a slight smile	111.79913880493798
Well while I was watchingnot the king as monsieur le comte thinks for I know what it is to see a man led to death and though I ought to be accustomed to the sight it always makes me illwhile I was watching the masked executioner the idea came to me as I said to find out who he was	106.38903542877958
Now as we are wo nt to complete ourselves each by all the rest and to depend on one another for assistance as one calls his other hand to aid the first I looked around instinctively to see if Porthos was there for I had seen you Aramis with the king and you count I knew would be under the scaffold and for that reason I forgive you he added offering Athos his hand for you must have suffered much	153.04827187756322
I was looking around for Porthos when I saw near me a head which had been broken but which for better or worse had been patched with plaster and with black silk	184.18691594381542
Humph thought I that looks like my handiwork I fancy I must have mended that skull somewhere or other	699.0018416003751
And in fact it was that unfortunate Scotchman Parrys brother you know on whom Groslow amused himself by trying his strength	663.7835266393004
Well this man was making signs to another at my left and turning around I recognized the honest Grimaud	424.4958792996713
Grimaud turned round with a jerk recognized me and pointed to the man in the mask	246.55532590577744
Eh said he which meant Do you see him Parbleu I answered and we perfectly understood one another	308.9283844488677
Well everything was finished as you know	16.364155424230056
I made a sign to Grimaud and the Scotchman and we all three retired into a corner of the square	140.80192871233453
I saw the executioner return into the kings room change his clothes put on a black hat and a large cloak and disappear	90.7556593505698
Five minutes later he came down the grand staircase	101.09879381221029
I should think so but not without difficulty	409.76793432723844
Every few minutes he turned around and thus obliged us to conceal ourselves	166.74168351896273
I might have gone up to him and killed him	44.3691861660582
But I am not selfish and I thought it might console you all a little to have a share in the matter	98.72183393135498
So we followed him through the lowest streets in the city and in half an hours time he stopped before a little isolated house	155.31198432520137
The man in the mask stopped before a low door and drew out a key but before he placed it in the lock he turned around to see if he was being followed	68.25219901744858
Grimaud and I got behind a tree and the Scotchman having nowhere to hide himself threw himself on his face in the road	121.12385781100592
Next moment the door opened and the man disappeared	22.6967360351778
While you have been returning hither he will have escaped and we shall never find him	91.73676424332686
Come now Aramis said DArtagnan you must be taking me for some one else	51.55976426304268
Nevertheless said Athos in your absence	120.72741461883646
Well in my absence have nt I put in my place Grimaud and the Scotchman Before he had taken ten steps beyond the door I had examined the house on all sides	140.36026285459852
At one of the doors that by which he had entered I placed our Scotchman making a sign to him to follow the man wherever he might go if he came out again	92.19934485379933
Then going around the house I placed Grimaud at the other exit and here I am	144.38638940018754
Athos threw himself into DArtagnans arms	12.095158427110379
Friend he said you have been too good in pardoning me I was wrong a hundred times wrong	187.99716544788566
I ought to have known you better by this time but we are all possessed of a malignant spirit which bids us doubt	233.30466685644018
Do nt you think the executioner might be Master Cromwell who to make sure of this affair undertook it himself	356.38517662231027
Cromwell is stout and short and this man thin and lanky rather tall than otherwise	588.6700634895079
Some condemned soldier perhaps suggested Athos whom they have pardoned at the price of regicide	251.42669611539478
No no continued DArtagnan it was not the measured step of a foot soldier nor was it the gait of a horseman	164.75879705774025
If I am not mistaken we have to do with a gentleman	49.4872987119169
Impossible It would be a dishonor to all the nobility	221.47751113333737
Fine sport by Jove cried Porthos with a laugh that shook the windows	90.6825328837161
Are you still bent on departure Athos asked DArtagnan	6843.265000735943
No I remain replied Athos with a threatening gesture that promised no good to whomsoever it was addressed	153.2335122252001
Swords then cried Aramis swords let us not lose a moment	18.72602492190363
The four friends resumed their own clothes girded on their swords ordered Mousqueton and Blaisois to pay the bill and to arrange everything for immediate departure and wrapped in their large cloaks left in search of their game	258.9236854074221
The night was dark snow was falling the streets were silent and deserted	148.2246024372657
DArtagnan led the way through the intricate windings and narrow alleys of the city and ere long they had reached the house in question	175.76816752243352
For a moment DArtagnan thought that Parrys brother had disappeared but he was mistaken	158.11208588708945
The robust Scotchman accustomed to the snows of his native hills had stretched himself against a post and like a fallen statue insensible to the inclemency of the weather had allowed the snow to cover him	199.66656425372153
He rose however as they approached	12.724818588522808
Come said Athos heres another good servant	446.04506885938
Really honest men are not so scarce as I thought	153.5191333908192
Do nt be in a hurry to weave crowns for our Scotchman	1169.2129752106262
I believe the fellow is here on his own account for I have heard that these gentlemen born beyond the Tweed are very vindictive	140.13356311658
I should not like to be Groslow if he meets him	513.157402231611
Well said Athos to the man in English	397.78045923260976
No one has come out he replied	146.4090852563837
Then Porthos and Aramis will you remain with this man while we go around to Grimaud	147.4413394049633
Grimaud had made himself a kind of sentry box out of a hollow willow and as they drew near he put his head out and gave a low whistle	130.33655223000628
No but somebody has gone in	15.835469527211457
Ah ah said DArtagnan there are two of them then	27.156855185838157
I wish there were four said Athos the two parties would then be equal	392.55619325106596
Perhaps there are four said DArtagnan	1026.2123669299199
Other men may have entered before them and waited for them	114.74660317203801
We can find out said Grimaud	37970.26092540558
At the same time he pointed to a window through the shutters of which a faint light streamed	89.46124369699996
That is true said DArtagnan let us call the others	28.154782961907372
They returned around the house to fetch Porthos and Aramis	289.92950960450867
Have you seen anything they asked	33.78725518494704
No but we are going to replied DArtagnan pointing to Grimaud who had already climbed some five or six feet from the ground	109.18003683898283
Grimaud continued to climb like a cat and succeeded at last in catching hold of a hook which served to keep one of the shutters back when opened	283.70863925236876
Then resting his foot on a small ledge he made a sign to show all was right	163.57740994935338
Grimaud showed his closed hand with two fingers spread out	207.28493278269318
Speak said Athos we can not see your signs	113.74759416023593
One opposite to me the other with his back to me	92.4623841564485
And the man opposite to you is	75.74095459659758
The man I saw go in	46.63271448439736
I thought I recognized him and was not mistaken	42.96084300332117
Who is it they all asked together in a low tone	27.235597759168265
The four friends looked at one another	114.29195459287186
The executioner said DArtagnan and Aramis at the same time	20.963691572440624
I can see nothing but his back resumed Grimaud	3004.230488726578
He is moving and if he has taken off his mask I shall be able to see	24.53734246759312
And as if struck in the heart he let go the hook and dropped with a groan	106.82447776915191
Did you see him they all asked	351.3128615139266
Yes said Grimaud with his hair standing on end	72.43497360189873
The executioner in short asked Aramis	2617.427995468291
And who is it said Porthos	1903.4749661564886
Heheis murmured Grimaud pale as a ghost and seizing his masters hand	108.64589245336641
DArtagnan Porthos and Aramis uttered a cry of joy	4.635915875523041
Athos stepped back and passed his hand across his brow	9.628144980122416
It was in fact Mordaunt whom DArtagnan had followed without knowing it	188.3809281851189
On entering the house he had taken off his mask and imitation beard then mounting a staircase had opened a door and in a room lighted by a single lamp found himself face to face with a man seated behind a desk	99.58172730863099
Cromwell had two or three of these retreats in London unknown except to the most intimate of his friends	215.32491180314443
It is you Mordaunt he said	4.670826606591516
General I wished to see the ceremony to the end which delayed me	152.73552063457
Ah I scarcely thought you were so curious as that	89.74138462496148
I am always curious to see the downfall of your honors enemies and he was not among the least of them	131.58398805112643
But you general were you not at Whitehall	415.5022242587448
Have you had any account of it	16.606294160290084
I have been here since the morning	70.29524399382713
I only know that there was a conspiracy to rescue the king	118.11589120468778
Ah you knew that said Mordaunt	5534.5357703917325
Four men disguised as workmen were to get the king out of prison and take him to Greenwich where a vessel was waiting	100.94975930814516
And knowing all that your honor remained here far from the city tranquil and inactive	337.4519203089321
But who told you I was inactive	3312.961344643095
I wished it to do so	3.4781191398051567
I thought your excellence considered the death of Charles I	70.27125260902575
as a misfortune necessary to the welfare of England	195.98367994172924
Yes his death but it would have been more seemly not upon the scaffold	158.90592285246615
Because it could have been said that I had had him condemned for the sake of justice and had let him escape out of pity	60.99318416468768
And does your honor know the four men who undertook to rescue him	105.2275698604081
The four Frenchmen of whom two were sent by the queen to her husband and two by Mazarin to me	135.93693988866565
And do you think Mazarin commissioned them to act as they have done	90.48175938973964
But he will not avow it	35.60524919636384
Your honor gave me two of these Frenchmen when they were only guilty of fighting for Charles I	176.01633956680448
Now that they are guilty of a conspiracy against England will your honor give me all four of them	200.05960200176065
Mordaunt bowed with a smile of triumphant ferocity	2009.779799482913
Did the people shout at all Cromwell asked	541.891760263975
Very little except Long live Cromwell	56958.32559713864
Mordaunt tried for a moment to read in the generals face if this was simply a useless question or whether he knew everything	153.32580325327632
But his piercing eyes could by no means penetrate the sombre depths of Cromwells	256.3358741692181
I was so situated as to hear and see everything he answered	151.9636604087436
It was now Cromwells turn to look fixedly at Mordaunt and Mordaunt to make himself impenetrable	461.74686583881106
It appears said Cromwell that this improvised executioner did his duty remarkably well	1894.5702804186574
The blow so they tell me at least was struck with a masters hand	70.88692958644553
Mordaunt remembered that Cromwell had told him he had had no detailed account and he was now quite convinced that the general had been present at the execution hidden behind some screen or curtain	190.8790196588959
In fact said Mordaunt with a calm voice and immovable countenance a single blow sufficed	77.68950219891867
Perhaps it was some one in that occupation said Cromwell	936.3553468700569
Do you think so sir He did not look like an executioner	214.88010008801479
And who else save an executioner would have wished to fill that horrible office	260.06296592978094
But said Mordaunt it might have been some personal enemy of the king who had made a vow of vengeance and accomplished it in this way	52.646199740700965
Perhaps it was some man of rank who had grave reasons for hating the fallen king and who learning that the king was about to flee and escape him threw himself in the way with a mask on his face and an axe in his hand not as substitute for the executioner but as an ambassador of Fate	128.8322422693689
And if that were the case would your honor condemn his action	777.7611045235856
It is not for me to judge	120.14673804934729
It rests between his conscience and his God	140.3282986068853
But if your honor knew this man	25.05322841188379
I neither know nor wish to know him	17.73528699108323
Provided Charles is dead it is the axe not the man we must thank	98.90760653576865
And yet without the man the king would have been rescued	103.0094671799197
They would have carried him to Greenwich he said and put him on board a felucca with five barrels of powder in the hold	147.41300673667388
Once out to sea you are too good a politician not to understand the rest Mordaunt	152.95422325840755
Yes they would have all been blown up	182.3318301049154
The explosion would have done what the axe had failed to do	97.5731665186334
Men would have said that the king had escaped human justice and been overtaken by Gods	278.4710134172029
You see now why I did not care to know your gentleman in the mask for really in spite of his excellent intentions I could not thank him for what he has done	97.88829363307757
Sir he said you are a profound thinker and your plan was sublime	407.99471512731486
Say absurd since it has become useless	231.3647514425236
The only sublime ideas in politics are those which bear fruit	756.4922053368111
So tonight Mordaunt go to Greenwich and ask for the captain of the felucca Lightning	352.8185192581797
Show him a white handkerchief knotted at the four corners and tell the crew to disembark and carry the powder back to the arsenal unless indeed	362.58405565974533
Unless said Mordaunt whose face was lighted by a savage joy as Cromwell spoke	238.90705924979795
This skiff might be of use to you for personal projects	156.85582911516684
That title said Cromwell laughing is all very well here but take care a word like that does not escape your lips in public	129.45755303752287
But your honor will soon be called so generally	150.96528483643456
I hope so at least said Cromwell rising and putting on his cloak	230.68619133564886
I slept here last night and the night before and you know it is not my custom to sleep three times in the same bed	49.4142448761811
Then said Mordaunt your honor gives me my liberty for tonight	118.25852097373321
And even for all day tomorrow if you want it	46.62246138300605
Since last evening he added smiling you have done enough in my service and if you have any personal matters to settle it is just that I should give you time	73.40798116062045
Thank you sir it will be well employed I hope	95.93996643659626
Cromwell turned as he was going	59.444434354173346
And no one waiting for you outside	583.7263013630321
Then you had better come with me	13.755101504710117
Thank you sir but the way by the subterranean passage would take too much time and I have none to lose	100.05985022521074
Cromwell placed his hand on a hidden handle and opened a door so well concealed by the tapestry that the most practiced eye could not have discovered it	104.22010049679534
It closed after him with a spring	49.42674550526776
This door communicated with a subterranean passage leading under the street to a grotto in the garden of a house about a hundred yards from that of the future Protector	98.96699024330493
It was just before this that Grimaud had perceived the two men seated together	197.48014891315768
DArtagnan was the first to recover from his surprise	132.844035230167
Ah by Heaven it is God Himself who sent us here	390.5624300685678
Yes said Porthos let us break the door in and fall upon him	105.37738401300928
Now Grimaud you come here climb up to the window again and tell us if Mordaunt is alone and whether he is preparing to go out or go to bed	87.47148456129926
If he comes out we shall catch him	27.599050470578725
If he stays in we will break in the window	97.4479444814015
It is easier and less noisy than the door	43.048123494567236
Grimaud began to scale the wall again	322.62308678158234
Keep guard at the other door Athos and Aramis	105.60959614018697
Porthos and I will stay here	27.31010277107662
We did not see his companion come out	221.08858636511826
He may have gone by the other door	72.00885009434619
Putting on his cloak and gloves	323.15234086891957
Porthos mechanically drew his dagger from the scabbard	35.79132345750224
Put it up again my friend said DArtagnan	98.00752922342275
We must proceed in an orderly manner	621.7765037615429
Hush said Grimaud he is coming out	93.68333607522281
He has put out the lamp I can see nothing now	62.47882462305004
The snow deadened the noise of his fall	68.72402067013148
Now go and tell Athos and Aramis to stand on each side of the door and clap their hands if they catch him	84.5574911412755
The next moment the door opened and Mordaunt appeared on the threshold face to face with DArtagnan	79.2226284872731
Porthos clapped his hands and the other two came running around	249.6384249562297
Mordaunt was livid but he uttered no cry nor called for assistance	173.02080219565465
DArtagnan quietly pushed him in again and by the light of a lamp on the staircase made him ascend the steps backward one by one keeping his eyes all the time on Mordaunts hands who however knowing that it was useless attempted no resistance	178.9399870300479
At last they stood face to face in the very room where ten minutes before Mordaunt had been talking to Cromwell	143.81946900001083
Porthos came up behind and unhooking the lamp on the staircase relit that in the room	120.81462722739045
Athos and Aramis entered last and locked the door behind them	52.178092368184444
Oblige me by taking a seat said DArtagnan pushing a chair toward Mordaunt who sat down pale but calm	315.822981118546
Aramis Porthos and DArtagnan drew their chairs near him	292.05372028400456
Athos alone kept away and sat in the furthest corner of the room as if determined to be merely a spectator of the proceedings	88.00869436743018
He seemed to be quite overcome	338.34696213039393
Porthos rubbed his hands in feverish impatience	2008.6146390098877
Aramis bit his lips till the blood came	64.69861551061392
DArtagnan alone was calm at least in appearance	127.14875954128227
Monsieur Mordaunt he said since after running after one another so long chance has at last brought us together let us have a little conversation if you please	149.67243154925282
Though Mordaunt had been so completely taken by surprise and had mounted the stairs in such utter confusion when once seated he recovered himself as it were and prepared to seize any possible opportunity of escape	233.17575228381833
His eye wandered to a long stout sword on his flank and he instinctively slipped it around within reach of his right hand	211.54441231131864
DArtagnan was waiting for a reply to his remark and said nothing	171.36630950536016
Aramis muttered to himself We shall hear nothing but the usual commonplace things	196.12882785291333
Porthos sucked his mustache muttering A good deal of ceremony tonight about crushing an adder	656.9257204184303
Athos shrunk into his corner pale and motionless as a basrelief	77.89235155134577
The silence however could not last forever	3407.768319796178
Sir he said with desperate politeness it seems to me that you change your costume almost as rapidly as I have seen the Italian mummers do whom the Cardinal Mazarin brought over from Bergamo and whom he doubtless took you to see during your travels in France	203.85303191285897
Just now DArtagnan continued you were disguisedI mean to say attiredas a murderer and now	807.4405449702398
And now I look very much like a man who is going to be murdered	20.97280502531407
Oh sir said DArtagnan how can you talk like that when you are in the company of gentlemen and have such an excellent sword at your side	81.35953424397366
No sword is excellent enough to be of use against four swords and daggers	188.1359827657171
Well that is scarcely the question	544.7945985222648
I had the honor of asking you why you altered your costume	285.3412236476889
The mask and beard became you very well and as to the axe I do not think it would be out of keeping even at this moment	44.41954407047503
Why then have you laid it aside	202.39583670169225
Because remembering the scene at Armentieres I thought I should find four axes for one as I was to meet four executioners	330.1628146128249
Sir replied DArtagnan in the calmest manner possible you are very young I shall therefore overlook your frivolous remarks	517.927058323426
What took place at Armentieres has no connection whatever with the present occasion	235.7933750522022
We could scarcely have requested your mother to take a sword and fight us	138.2037223359514
Aha It is a duel then cried Mordaunt as if disposed to reply at once to the provocation	182.93427084838947
Porthos rose always ready for this kind of adventure	96.39881151721787
Do not let us do things in a hurry	60.42222033209543
We will arrange the matter rather better	580.857955782644
Confess Monsieur Mordaunt that you are anxious to kill some of us	60.30514956251418
Then my dear sir I am convinced that these gentlemen return your kind wishes and will be delighted to kill you also	108.90774371864308
Of course they will do so as honorable gentlemen and the best proof I can furnish is this	135.83972085230033
So saying he threw his hat on the ground pushed back his chair to the wall and bowed to Mordaunt with true French grace	122.18712421514434
At your service sir he continued	429.80437937658377
My sword is shorter than yours its true but bah I think the arm will make up for the sword	247.4439413109179
I begin and without any rhetoric	162151.50483623915
He might have been taken for a statue	69.40643489274241
Even his breathing seemed to be arrested	98.65180054817947
Gentlemen said DArtagnan you shall have your turn	116.24251481625402
Monsieur Mordaunt dislikes you sufficiently not to refuse you afterward	240.84825193653694
You can see it in his eye	54.45858892198012
So pray keep your places like Athos whose calmness is entirely laudable	1988.2870637941971
Besides we will have no words about it	71.28781257732162
I have particular business to settle with this gentleman and I shall and will begin	89.60175813455928
Porthos and Aramis drew back disappointed and drawing his sword DArtagnan turned to his adversary	255.2235622791921
Sir I am waiting for you	4.665077229207484
And for my part gentlemen I admire you	44.87065300101023
You are disputing which shall fight me first but you do not consult me who am most concerned in the matter	59.94795753531859
I hate you all but not equally	423.3160016391174
I hope to kill all four of you but I am more likely to kill the first than the second the second than the third and the third than the last	70.87148938956885
I claim then the right to choose my opponent	509.4552672744638
If you refuse this right you may kill me but I shall not fight	21.444804278438813
It is but fair said Porthos and Aramis hoping he would choose one of them	147.77277153398452
Athos and DArtagnan said nothing but their silence seemed to imply consent	224.1599136736383
Well then said Mordaunt I choose for my adversary the man who not thinking himself worthy to be called Comte de la Fere calls himself Athos	196.07069350563134
Athos sprang up but after an instant of motionless silence he said to the astonishment of his friends Monsieur Mordaunt a duel between us is impossible	104.37553898318318
Submit this honour to somebody else	188.00307170337095
Ah said Mordaunt with a sneer there s one who is afraid	282.26341368694756
Zounds exclaimed DArtagnan bounding toward him who says that Athos is afraid	117.09344048832214
Let him have his say DArtagnan said Athos with a smile of sadness and contempt	76.918072627481
Is it your decision Athos resumed the Gascon	532.0752129711959
You hear sir said DArtagnan turning to Mordaunt	229.56364548492127
The Comte de la Fere will not do you the honor of fighting with you	27.64352841817324
Choose one of us to replace the Comte de la Fere	43.84830158506279
As long as I do nt fight with him it is the same to me with whom I fight	78.47784311552714
Put your names into a hat and draw lots	471.6270466326545
At least that will conciliate us all said Aramis	85.90426516658088
I should never have thought of that said Porthos and yet it is very simple	52.33807222174855
Come Aramis said DArtagnan write this for us in those neat little characters in which you wrote to Marie Michon that the mother of this gentleman intended to assassinate the Duke of Buckingham	180.7756659201742
Mordaunt sustained this new attack without wincing	5735.156443521998
He stood with his arms folded apparently as calm as any man could be in such circumstances	106.86988341443076
If he had not courage he had what is very like it namely pride	413.7790817539002
Aramis went to Cromwells desk tore off three bits of paper of equal size wrote on the first his own name and on the others those of his two companions and presented them open to Mordaunt who by a movement of his head indicated that he left the matter entirely to Aramis	127.38231632482788
He then rolled them separately and put them in a hat which he handed to Mordaunt	60.398451215395994
Mordaunt put his hand into the hat took out one of the three papers and disdainfully dropped it on the table without reading it	76.10874985509896
Ah serpent muttered DArtagnan I would give my chance of a captaincy in the mousquetaires for that to be my name	197.09918854374212
Aramis opened the paper and in a voice trembling with hate and vengeance read DArtagnan	451.08882501120036
The Gascon uttered a cry of joy and turning to Mordaunt	38.70478601092365
I hope sir said he you have no objection to make	43.07780584954866
None whatever replied the other drawing his sword and resting the point on his boot	128.29201061813706
The moment that DArtagnan saw that his wish was accomplished and his man would not escape him he recovered his usual tranquillity	104.55489013179144
He turned up his cuffs neatly and rubbed the sole of his right boot on the floor but did not fail however to remark that Mordaunt was looking about him in a singular manner	145.49062512529522
Are you ready sir he said at last	25.052218471262407
I was waiting for you sir said Mordaunt raising his head and casting at his opponent a look it would be impossible to describe	59.5419523952363
Well then said the Gascon take care of yourself for I am not a bad hand at the rapier	64.27491651319656
So much the better that sets my mind at rest	818.3697900578982
One minute said the young man	1.3140999254665473
Give me your word gentlemen that you will not attack me otherwise than one after the other	78.82928196884548
Is it to have the pleasure of insulting us that you say that my little viper	197.3466613720754
No but to set my mind at rest as you observed just now	124.2245412980275
It is for something else than that I imagine muttered DArtagnan shaking his head doubtfully	416.80707458563796
On the honor of gentlemen said Aramis and Porthos	375.50047280543794
In that case gentlemen have the kindness to retire into the corners so as to give us ample room	159.36798205343618
Yes gentlemen said DArtagnan we must not leave this person the slightest pretext for behaving badly which with all due respect I fancy he is anxious still to do	255.42275701912456
This new attack made no impression on Mordaunt	638.1048493552154
The space was cleared the two lamps placed on Cromwells desk in order that the combatants might have as much light as possible and the swords crossed	196.65221723847438
DArtagnan was too good a swordsman to trifle with his opponent	1276.1510286859404
He made a rapid and brilliant feint which Mordaunt parried	5153.093315070228
Aha he cried with a smile of satisfaction	21.99100424554182
And without losing a minute thinking he saw an opening he thrust his right in and forced Mordaunt to parry a counter en quarte so fine that the point of the weapon might have turned within a wedding ring	327.37720846741666
This time it was Mordaunt who smiled	84.01356704039571
Ah sir said DArtagnan you have a wicked smile	80.6521105915074
It must have been the devil who taught it you was it not	182.08947220608675
Mordaunt replied by trying his opponents weapon with an amount of strength which the Gascon was astonished to find in a form apparently so feeble but thanks to a parry no less clever than that which Mordaunt had just achieved he succeeded in meeting his sword which slid along his own without touching his chest	278.2302524915871
Mordaunt rapidly sprang back a step	201.99776361542484
Ah you lose ground you are turning Well as you please I even gain something by it for I no longer see that wicked smile of yours	202.2694888223205
You have no idea what a false look you have particularly when you are afraid	114.38111781053158
Look at my eyes and you will see what no lookingglass has ever shown youa frank and honorable countenance	415.87420409896686
To this flow of words not perhaps in the best taste but characteristic of DArtagnan whose principal object was to divert his opponents attention Mordaunt did not reply but continuing to turn around he succeeded in changing places with DArtagnan	444.48238509892303
He smiled more and more sarcastically and his smile began to make the Gascon anxious	240.40420364032727
Come come cried DArtagnan we must finish with this and in his turn he pressed Mordaunt hard who continued to lose ground but evidently on purpose and without letting his sword leave the line for a moment	194.59715634439766
However as they were fighting in a room and had not space to go on like that forever Mordaunts foot at last touched the wall against which he rested his left hand	127.26011965798223
Ah this time you can not lose ground my fine friend exclaimed DArtagnan	332.9747714606233
Gentlemen did you ever see a scorpion pinned to a wall No	1802.1602496364749
Well then you shall see it now	61.41384935836449
In a second DArtagnan had made three terrible thrusts at Mordaunt all of which touched but only pricked him	788.7312592088953
The three friends looked on panting and astonished	1272.1878946274478
At last DArtagnan having got up too close stepped back to prepare a fourth thrust but the moment when after a fine quick feint he was attacking as sharply as lightning the wall seemed to give way Mordaunt disappeared through the opening and DArtagnans blade caught between the panels shivered like a sword of glass	344.14620438175456
DArtagnan sprang back the wall had closed again	129.1755533896935
Mordaunt in fact while defending himself had manoeuvred so as to reach the secret door by which Cromwell had left had felt for the knob with his left hand pressed it and disappeared	95.48044480336549
The Gascon uttered a furious imprecation which was answered by a wild laugh on the other side of the iron panel	71.5322632905151
Help me gentlemen cried DArtagnan we must break in this door	173.70436317508452
It is the devil in person said Aramis hastening forward	783.3686862759411
He escapes us growled Porthos pushing his huge shoulder against the hinges but in vain	194.4435936704093
So much the better muttered Athos	5443.780908319465
I thought as much said DArtagnan wasting his strength in useless efforts	1304.1608450065182
Zounds I thought as much when the wretch kept moving around the room	253.28970632418967
I thought he was up to something	463.2326859661522
Its a misfortune to which his friend the devil treats us said Aramis	430.9095767697713
Its a piece of good fortune sent from Heaven said Athos evidently much relieved	593.643910570395
Really said DArtagnan abandoning the attempt to burst open the panel after several ineffectual attempts Athos I can not imagine how you can talk to us in that way	208.8930281488132
You can not understand the position we are in	122.12358997787904
In this kind of game not to kill is to let ones self be killed	381.75938586135777
This fox of a fellow will be sending us a hundred ironsided beasts who will pick us off like sparrows in this place	471.10910976447946
Come come we must be off	778.4336681527717
If we stay here five minutes more there s an end of us	83.44831152378842
But where shall we go asked Porthos	221.19528286422772
To the hotel to be sure to get our baggage and horses and from there if it please God to France where at least I understand the architecture of the houses	158.11988787948053
So suiting the action to the word DArtagnan thrust the remnant of his sword into its scabbard picked up his hat and ran down the stairs followed by the others	76.71092918714021
DArtagnan had judged correctly Mordaunt felt that he had no time to lose and he lost none	52.43961453595631
He knew the rapidity of decision and action that characterized his enemies and resolved to act with reference to that	397.9832624507716
This time the musketeers had an adversary who was worthy of them	150.11380152762598
After closing the door carefully behind him Mordaunt glided into the subterranean passage sheathing on the way his now useless sword and thus reached the neighboring house where he paused to examine himself and to take breath	232.96469928156668
Good he said nothing almost nothingscratches nothing more two in the arm and one in the breast	219.61425577931968
The wounds that I make are better than thatwitness the executioner of Bethune my uncle and King Charles	567.9041445369858
Now not a second to lose for a second lost will perhaps save them	144.7773009001826
They must diedie all togetherkilled at one stroke by the thunder of men in default of Gods	161.66111507165581
They must disappear broken scattered annihilated	311996.2181861811
I will run then till my legs no longer serve till my heart bursts in my bosom but I will arrive before they do	108.88121437781906
Mordaunt proceeded at a rapid pace to the nearest cavalry barracks about a quarter of a league distant	150.47857456842883
He made that quarter of a league in four or five minutes	51.61425680245245
Arrived at the barracks he made himself known took the best horse in the stables mounted and gained the high road	203.7932457598357
A quarter of an hour later he was at Greenwich	166.94559169853218
There is the port he murmured	52.518972647055065
That dark point yonder is the Isle of Dogs	276.39809043616384
Good I am half an hour in advance of them an hour perhaps	47.20019971912558
Fool that I was I have almost killed myself by my needless haste	224.22891080622597
Now he added rising in the stirrups and looking about him which I wonder is the Lightning	229.81822759743483
At this moment as if in reply to his words a man lying on a coil of cables rose and advanced a few steps toward him	140.5217994804669
Mordaunt drew a handkerchief from his pocket and tying a knot at each cornerthe signal agreed uponwaved it in the air and the man came up to him	177.8275312058246
He was wrapped in a large rough cape which concealed his form and partly his face	230.89685010461653
Do you wish to go on the water sir said the sailor	107.6838545425275
And perhaps you have a preference for one boat more than another	392.6507889734215
You would like one that sails as rapidly as	396.40403231509805
Then mine is the boat you want sir	224.86602343612788
I begin to think so particularly if you have not forgotten a certain signal	105.79872221368736
Here it is sir and the sailor took from his coat a handkerchief tied at each corner	113.25643571893653
Good quite right cried Mordaunt springing off his horse	44.859090401668105
There s not a moment to lose now take my horse to the nearest inn and conduct me to your vessel	135.21100347647845
But asked the sailor where are your companions I thought there were four of you	176.45342913200201
I m not the man you take me for you are in Captain Rogerss post are you not under orders from General Cromwell	269.7410922266587
Indeed sir I recognize you you are Captain Mordaunt	615.1117638086032
Oh fear nothing said the skipper showing his face	610.7033948569322
The general remembered that I had formerly been a naval officer and he gave me the command of this expedition	136.5339340364612
Is there anything new in the wind	95.12605448373692
I thought perhaps that the kings death	262.09423856435524
Has only hastened their flight in ten minutes they will perhaps be here	39.73808606611983
What have you come for then	91.09777012296698
Ah ah the general doubted my fidelity	652.7231096969955
No but I wish to have a share in my revenge	79.15295951728571
Have nt you some one who will relieve me of my horse	72.23834408990572
Groslow whistled and a sailor appeared	216.2056936291223
Patrick said Groslow take this horse to the stables of the nearest inn	93.78249127257642
If any one asks you whose it is you can say that it belongs to an Irish gentleman	130.26767193135362
Now said Mordaunt are you not afraid that they will recognize you	36.619066370145546
There is no danger dressed as I am in this pilot coat on a night as dark as this	137.43855789187512
Besides even you did nt recognize me they will be much less likely to	44.372617944160005
That is true said Mordaunt and they will be far from thinking of you	65.05488669682283
Everything is ready is it not	5.705214449303921
We are carrying port wine to Anvers	1145.1200374175608
Now take me aboard and return to your post for they will soon be here	58.7346236086388
It is important that none of your crew should see me	80.88505026906068
I have but one man on board and I am as sure of him as I am of myself	58.74078228795492
Besides he does nt know you like his mates he is ready to obey our orders knowing nothing of our plan	183.34367675149306
They then went down to the Thames	312.53085598051376
A boat was fastened to the shore by a chain fixed to a stake	182.02649009319902
Groslow jumped in followed by Mordaunt and in five minutes they were quite away from that world of houses which then crowded the outskirts of London and Mordaunt could discern the little vessel riding at anchor near the Isle of Dogs	288.32318578422974
When they reached the side of this felucca Mordaunt dexterous in his eagerness for vengeance seized a rope and climbed up the side of the vessel with a coolness and agility very rare among landsmen	400.3333038008318
He went with Groslow to the captains berth a sort of temporary cabin of planks for the chief apartment had been given up by Captain Rogers to the passengers who were to be accommodated at the other end of the boat	168.31300406515084
They will have nothing to do then at this end said Mordaunt	151.45361000040424
Return to Greenwich and bring them here	126.27250700732831
I shall hide myself in your cabin	489.0320904823901
It appeared light and well constructed	61123.099948172676
Fasten it to the poop with a rope put the oars into it so that it may follow in the track and there will be nothing to do except to cut the cord	124.68172018537857
Put a good supply of rum and biscuit in it for the seamen should the night happen to be stormy they will not be sorry to find something to console themselves with	142.8992941028074
Do you wish to see the powderroom	1250.0117756959278
When you return I will set the fuse myself but be careful to conceal your face so that you can not be recognized by them	101.7602258433708
There s ten oclock striking at Greenwich	2437.5936265011537
Groslow then having given the sailor on duty an order to be on the watch with more than usual vigilance went down into the longboat and soon reached Greenwich	289.7990255730763
The wind was chilly and the jetty was deserted as he approached it but he had no sooner landed than he heard a noise of horses galloping upon the paved road	139.31406095905632
These horsemen were our friends or rather an avant garde composed of DArtagnan and Athos	589.8102951076474
As soon as they arrived at the spot where Groslow stood they stopped as if guessing that he was the man they wanted	144.62086111749002
Athos alighted and calmly opened the handkerchief tied at each corner whilst DArtagnan ever cautious remained on horseback one hand upon his pistol leaning forward watchfully	737.0197080011576
On seeing the appointed signal Groslow who had at first crept behind one of the cannons planted on that spot walked straight up to the gentlemen	225.2512090501432
He was so well wrapped up in his cloak that it would have been impossible to see his face even if the night had not been so dark as to render precaution superfluous nevertheless the keen glance of Athos perceived at once it was not Rogers who stood before them	110.58729469331621
What do you want with us he asked of Groslow	155.98434796219848
I wish to inform you my lord replied Groslow with an Irish accent feigned of course that if you are looking for Captain Rogers you will not find him	150.23878687152538
He fell down this morning and broke his leg	160.67098408785563
But I m his cousin he told me everything and desired me to watch instead of him and in his place to conduct wherever they wished to go the gentlemen who should bring me a handkerchief tied at each corner like that one which you hold and one which I have in my pocket	105.57085354157856
And he drew out the handkerchief	668.7473795012312
Was that all he said inquired Athos	3139.2897279826575
No my lord he said you had engaged to pay seventy pounds if I landed you safe and sound at Boulogne or any other port you choose in France	338.7158974799738
What do you think of all this said Athos in a low tone to DArtagnan after explaining to him in French what the sailor had said in English	145.73185795480202
It seems a likely story to me	17.58777101195867
Besides we can but blow out his brains if he proves false said the Gascon and you Athos you know something of everything and can be our captain	144.37374626704027
I dare say you know how to navigate should he fail us	1187.8841081348996
My dear friend you guess well	421.35416225581986
My father meant me for the navy and I have some vague notions about navigation	584.9961983051331
They then summoned their friends who with Blaisois Mousqueton and Grimaud promptly joined them leaving Parry behind them who was to take back to London the horses of the gentlemen and of their lackeys which had been sold to the host in settlement of their account with him	236.6538932141536
Thanks to this stroke of business the four friends were able to take away with them a sum of money which if not large was sufficient as a provision against delays and accidents	181.6621000940336
Parry parted from his friends regretfully they had proposed his going with them to France but he had straightway declined	447.2267395160508
It is very simple Mousqueton had said he is thinking of Groslow	231.05653235120712
It was Captain Groslow the reader will remember who had broken Parrys head	1311.8490383592061
DArtagnan resumed immediately the attitude of distrust that was habitual with him	267.80821706301
He found the wharf too completely deserted the night too dark the captain too accommodating	784.76440640235
He had reported to Aramis what had taken place and Aramis not less distrustful than he had increased his suspicions	136.87394668586478
A slight click of the tongue against his teeth informed Athos of the Gascons uneasiness	763.5567288475627
We have no time now for suspicions said Athos	1000.3381710337678
The boat is waiting for us come	145.32713957342972
Besides said Aramis what prevents our being distrustful and going aboard at the same time We can watch the skipper	373.34254395795136
And if he does nt go straight I will crush him that s all	91.08051328038205
You first Mousqueton and he stopped his friends directing the valets to go first in order to test the plank leading from the pier to the boat	149.60994880474183
The three valets passed without accident	3110.0042734513895
Athos followed them then Porthos then Aramis	216.6172014692477
DArtagnan went last still shaking his head	2.203075125941887
What in the devil is the matter with you my friend said Porthos	47.67483662682366
Upon my word you would make Caesar afraid	6473.266721596269
The matter is replied DArtagnan that I can see upon this pier neither inspector nor sentinel nor exciseman	657.4423357590252
And you complain of that said Porthos	338.4813820492384
Everything goes as if in flowery paths	23229.42266663504
But no matter we must trust in God	607.6616429425883
As soon as the plank was withdrawn the captain took his place at the tiller and made a sign to one of the sailors who boathook in hand began to push out from the labyrinth of boats in which they were involved	104.92707372286732
The other sailor had already seated himself on the port side and was ready to row	146.2474544284025
As soon as there was room for rowing his companion rejoined him and the boat began to move more rapidly	317.13067792267776
At last we are off exclaimed Porthos	4879.582869831288
Alas said Athos we depart alone	136.98263474711896
Yes but all four together and without a scratch which is a consolation	186.27281374038614
We are not yet at our destination observed the prudent DArtagnan beware of misadventure	1641.0472665656491
Ah my friend cried Porthos like the crows you always bring bad omens	1581.9522965751705
Who could intercept us on such a night as this pitch dark when one does not see more than twenty yards before one	198.16720105985695
Tomorrow we shall be at Boulogne	6402.283604581326
I hope so with all my heart said the Gascon and I confess my weakness	53.81311206342069
Yes Athos you may laugh but as long as we were within gunshot of the pier or of the vessels lying by it I was looking for a frightful discharge of musketry which would crush us	148.0837088015675
But said Porthos with great wisdom that was impossible for they would have killed the captain and the sailors	94.96360173666886
Bah much Monsieur Mordaunt would care	2344.9576950524115
You do nt imagine he would consider a little thing like that	149.79639976934428
At any rate said Porthos I am glad to hear DArtagnan admit that he is afraid	103.23983415799947
I not only confess it but am proud of it returned the Gascon I m not such a rhinoceros as you are	128.48983131035726
The Lightning answered the captain our felucca	15674.269067443356
So far so good laughed Athos	14596.279659720136
They went on board and the captain instantly conducted them to the berth prepared for thema cabin which was to serve for all purposes and for the whole party he then tried to slip away under pretext of giving orders to some one	243.65787735874903
Stop a moment cried DArtagnan pray how many men have you on board captain	182.52510441769644
I do nt understand was the reply	114.18172975833033
Groslow on the question being interpreted answered Three without counting myself	15291.086291903272
DArtagnan understood for while replying the captain had raised three fingers	200.21495566394677
Oh he exclaimed I begin to be more at my ease however whilst you settle yourselves I shall make the round of the boat	193.41551165141595
As for me said Porthos I will see to the supper	53.462540795310936
A very good idea Porthos said the Gascon	40.210952192468966
Athos lend me Grimaud who in the society of his friend Parry has perhaps picked up a little English and can act as my interpreter	210.57524026749493
DArtagnan finding a lantern on the deck took it up and with a pistol in his hand he said to the captain in English Come being with the classic English oath the only English words he knew and so saying he descended to the lower deck	144.21791498325766
This was divided into three compartmentsone which was covered by the floor of that room in which Athos Porthos and Aramis were to pass the night the second was to serve as the sleepingroom for the servants the third under the prow of the ship was under the temporary cabin in which Mordaunt was concealed	138.52996522530754
Oho cried DArtagnan as he went down the steps of the hatchway preceded by the lantern what a number of barrels one would think one was in the cave of Ali Baba	123.99555586163069
What is there in them he added putting his lantern on one of the casks	95.43522474780985
The captain seemed inclined to go upon deck again but controlling himself he answered	425.30549754410237
Ah port wine tis a comfort said the Gascon since we shall not die of thirst	104.78022823317153
Grimaud translated the question and Groslow who was wiping the perspiration from off his forehead answered	270.51567914619085
DArtagnan struck the barrels with his hand and having ascertained that he spoke the truth pushed his lantern greatly to the captains alarm into the interstices between the barrels and finding that there was nothing concealed in them	165.9312581382151
Come along he said and he went toward the door of the second compartment	54.08712067804219
Stop said the Englishman I have the key of that door and he opened the door with a trembling hand into the second compartment where Mousqueton and Blaisois were preparing supper	120.47182235845091
Here there was evidently nothing to seek or to apprehend and they passed rapidly to examine the third compartment	228.73161557833308
This was the room appropriated to the sailors	52.75694282149999
Two or three hammocks hung upon the ceiling a table and two benches composed the entire furniture	216.15788650378178
DArtagnan picked up two or three old sails hung on the walls and meeting nothing to suspect regained by the hatchway the deck of the vessel	208.27826508732966
And this room he asked pointing to the captains cabin	609.4561024493238
That s my room replied Groslow	28167.12071288323
DArtagnan stretched out his arm in which he held the lantern put his head in at the half opened door and seeing that the cabin was nothing better than a shed	92.29409976499187
If there is an army on board it is not here that it is hidden	65.85118440564776
Let us see what Porthos has found for supper	406.08837813163814
And thanking the captain he regained the state cabin where his friends were	382.2931602564488
Porthos had found nothing and with him fatigue had prevailed over hunger	619.5100056327973
He had fallen asleep and was in a profound slumber when DArtagnan returned	241.83324244865852
Athos and Aramis were beginning to close their eyes which they half opened when their companion came in again	184.31489709189978
All is well we may sleep tranquilly	4580.030801710207
On this assurance the two friends fell asleep and DArtagnan who was very weary bade goodnight to Grimaud and laid himself down in his cloak with naked sword at his side in such a manner that his body barricaded the passage and it should be impossible to enter the room without upsetting him	138.2415932365255
In ten minutes the masters slept not so the servantshungry and more thirsty than hungry	695.3113174105983
Blaisois and Mousqueton set themselves to preparing their bed which consisted of a plank and a valise	268.3586431411408
On a hanging table which swung to and fro with the rolling of the vessel were a pot of beer and three glasses	124.69814642221438
I know it will serve me as it did when we came over	72.31212847601506
And to think said Mousqueton that we have nothing to fight seasickness with but barley bread and hop beer	832.8911930316898
But where is your wicker flask Monsieur Mousqueton Have you lost it asked Blaisois	1169.8915495629863
No replied Mousqueton Parry kept it	22.708814278110047
Those devilish Scotchmen are always thirsty	10370.171537290837
And you Grimaud he said to his companion who had just come in after his round with DArtagnan are you thirsty	163.2278845806216
As thirsty as a Scotchman was Grimauds laconic reply	7342.598010734418
And he sat down and began to cast up the accounts of his party whose money he managed	109.61194516482531
Oh lackadaisy I m beginning to feel queer cried Blaisois	1837.761509904588
If that s the case said Mousqueton with a learned air take some nourishment	420.91621723558825
Do you call that nourishment said Blaisois pointing to the barley bread and pot of beer upon the table	154.70704061054084
Blaisois replied Mousqueton remember that bread is the true nourishment of a Frenchman who is not always able to get bread ask Grimaud	375.5682123913278
Yes but beer asked Blaisois sharply is that their true drink	933.1964493903815
As to that answered Mousqueton puzzled how to get out of the difficulty I must confess that to me beer is as disagreeable as wine is to the English	212.83782921687705
What Monsieur Mousqueton The Englishdo they dislike wine	7304.7351201800975
But I have seen them drink it	585.7316461542163
For example an English prince died one day because they had put him into a butt of Malmsey	141.21313834543804
I heard the Chevalier dHerblay say so	194.79553759486282
The fool cried Blaisois I wish I had been in his place	40.63819296280787
Thou canst be said Grimaud writing down his figures	1307.9319904928036
How asked Blaisois I can Explain yourself	6415.398310320936
Grimaud went on with his sum and cast up the whole	102.97120464837874
Port he said extending his hand in the direction of the first compartment examined by DArtagnan and himself	85.72305746761775
Eh eh ah Those barrels I saw through the door	28.067911507523412
Port replied Grimaud beginning a fresh sum	663.5357106996505
I have heard said Blaisois that port is a very good wine	144.33249107918115
Excellent exclaimed Mousqueton smacking his lips	62.351052463437185
Excellent there is port wine in the cellar of Monsieur le Baron de Bracieux	189.955334953167
Suppose we ask these Englishmen to sell us a bottle said the honest Blaisois	226.48703500953377
Sell cried Mousqueton about whom there was a remnant of his ancient marauding character left	420.26636089500244
One may well perceive young man that you are inexperienced	109.7653282651408
Why buy what one can take	235.53526718331196
Take said Blaisois covet the goods of your neighbor That is forbidden it seems to me	148.8105654814048
In the commandments of God or of the church I do nt know which	89.27638626044217
I only know it says Thou shalt not covet thy neighbors goods nor yet his wife	1523.570203878432
That is a childs reason Monsieur Blaisois said Mousqueton in his most patronizing manner	428.1744397400285
Yes you talk like a childI repeat the word	876.7297085167653
Where have you read in the Scriptures I ask you that the English are your neighbors	146.60449919590602
Where that is true said Blaisois at least I ca nt now recall it	159.0781501451294
A childs reasonI repeat it continued Mousqueton	4432.427877030469
If you had been ten years engaged in war as Grimaud and I have been my dear Blaisois you would know the difference there is between the goods of others and the goods of enemies	127.71467889169497
Now an Englishman is an enemy this port wine belongs to the English therefore it belongs to us	226.2716897804899
And our masters asked Blaisois stupefied by this harangue delivered with an air of profound sagacity will they be of your opinion	206.79856016057968
I suppose that you think it necessary that I should disturb the repose of these illustrious lords to say Gentlemen your servant Mousqueton is thirsty	421.5673461228871
What does Monsieur Bracieux care think you whether I am thirsty or not	124.09422817782297
Tis a very expensive wine said Blaisois shaking his head	40.59416914759671
Were it liquid gold Monsieur Blaisois our masters would not deny themselves this wine	480.9625248865061
Know that Monsieur de Bracieux is rich enough to drink a tun of port wine even if obliged to pay a pistole for every drop	185.88949268917338
His manner became more and more lofty every instant then he arose and after finishing off the beer at one draught he advanced majestically to the door of the compartment where the wine was	141.90532066369602
Ah locked he exclaimed these devils of English how suspicious they are	457.64275767734716
Locked said Blaisois ah the deuce it is unlucky for my stomach is getting more and more upset	349.2896260832288
But Blaisois ventured to say I have heard you relate Monsieur Mousqueton that once on a time at Chantilly you fed your master and yourself by taking partridges in a snare carp with a line and bottles with a slipnoose	314.87400209577345
Perfectly true but there was an airhole in the cellar and the wine was in bottles	161.76366228928853
I can not throw the loop through this partition nor move with a packthread a cask of wine which may perhaps weigh two hundred pounds	444.53890950611606
No but you can take out two or three boards of the partition answered Blaisois and make a hole in the cask with a gimlet	224.14450981337944
Mousqueton opened his great round eyes to the utmost astonished to find in Blaisois qualities for which he did not give him credit	155.0420985072153
Tis true he said but where can I get a chisel to take the planks out a gimlet to pierce the cask	231.36760688700622
Trousers said Grimaud still squaring his accounts	269.18547265251357
Grimaud in fact was not only the accountant but the armorer of the party and as he was a man full of forethought these trousers carefully rolled up in his valise contained every sort of tool for immediate use	250.1660674554076
Mousqueton therefore was soon provided with tools and he began his task	226.58345437995675
In a few minutes he had extracted three boards	3726.347279177007
He tried to pass his body through the aperture but not being like the frog in the fable who thought he was larger than he really was he found he must take out three or four more before he could get through	163.83878137452598
He sighed and set to work again	246.77223036169508
Grimaud had now finished his accounts	5073.160158137388
He arose and stood near Mousqueton	21898.324817607776
That is true said Mousqueton glancing at his friends long and thin body you will pass easily	255.5236816240635
And he knows the full casks said Blaisois for he has already been in the hold with Monsieur le Chevalier dArtagnan	326.8304568107051
Let Monsieur Grimaud go in Monsieur Mouston	8656.256687015955
I could go in as well as Grimaud said Mousqueton a little piqued	351.5126428566754
Yes but that would take too much time and I am thirsty	76.0798293703494
I am getting more and more seasick	2413.0072134285456
Go in then Grimaud said Mousqueton handing him the beer pot and gimlet	1980.6947470992893
Then with a friendly gesture toward Mousqueton that he might forgive him for finishing an enterprise so brilliantly begun by another he glided like a serpent through the opening and disappeared	265.50496601239246
Blaisois was in a state of great excitement he was in ecstasies	162.07340950956072
Of all the exploits performed since their arrival in England by the extraordinary men with whom he had the honor to be associated this seemed without question to be the most wonderful	112.45927910784046
You are about to see said Mousqueton looking at Blaisois with an expression of superiority which the latter did not even think of questioning you are about to see Blaisois how we old soldiers drink when we are thirsty	129.85660318627433
My cloak said Grimaud from the bottom of the hold	29.39599890208596
What do you want asked Blaisois	31845.713431221786
My cloakstop up the aperture with it	65.49754605909135
Simpleton exclaimed Mousqueton suppose any one came into the room	21.999487411178027
Ah true cried Blaisois with evident admiration but it will be dark in the cellar	132.9390209101102
Grimaud always sees dark or light night as well as day answered Mousqueton	407.31537590009333
As for me when I have no candle I ca nt take two steps without knocking against something	161.16260285605202
That s because you have nt served said Mousqueton	1101.217308137778
Had you been in the army you would have been able to pick up a needle on the floor of a closed oven	67.76722347949388
But hark I think some one is coming	231.0042753274859
Mousqueton made with a low whistling sound the sign of alarm well known to the lackeys in the days of their youth resumed his place at the table and made a sign to Blaisois to follow his example	97.5285826953735
The door of their cabin was opened	12.818583184256594
Two men wrapped in their cloaks appeared	398.283103148629
Oho said they not in bed at a quarter past eleven	87.3294527324477
In a quarter of an hour let every one be in bed and snoring	159.69023236169897
These two men then went toward the compartment in which Grimaud was secreted opened the door entered and shut it after them	122.99262716764966
Ah cried Blaisois he is lost	146.2747912040881
Grimauds a cunning fellow murmured Mousqueton	4196.950608061731
They waited for ten minutes during which time no noise was heard that might indicate that Grimaud was discovered and at the expiration of that anxious interval the two men returned closed the door after them and repeating their orders that the servants should go to bed and extinguish their lights disappeared	141.10218839503852
They said a quarter of an hour	3.408914207288262
We still have five minutes replied Mousqueton	3572.9746898082512
But perhaps they have killed him	8.616493184762518
You know he is almost dumb	17042.157333074196
We should have heard the blow then	592.5303152426311
But if he does nt return	495.09802985926154
At that very moment Grimaud drew back the cloak which hid the aperture and came in with his face livid his eyes staring wide open with terror so that the pupils were contracted almost to nothing with a large circle of white around them	129.66377646137812
He held in his hand a tankard full of a dark substance and approaching the gleam of light shed by the lamp he uttered this single monosyllable Oh with such an expression of extreme terror that Mousqueton started alarmed and Blaisois was near fainting from fright	315.3812190272215
Both however cast an inquisitive glance into the tankardit was full of gunpowder	129.94701383606065
Convinced that the ship was full of powder instead of having a cargo of wine Grimaud hastened to awake DArtagnan who had no sooner beheld him than he perceived that something extraordinary had taken place	142.7767756655466
Imposing silence Grimaud put out the little night lamp then knelt down and poured into the lieutenants ear a recital melodramatic enough not to require play of feature to give it pith	511.4299087830541
This was the gist of his strange story	246.615425865977
The first barrel that Grimaud had found on passing into the compartment he struckit was empty	286.9675197951963
He passed on to anotherit also was empty but the third which he tried was from the dull sound it gave out evidently full	289.5424671471012
At this point Grimaud stopped and was preparing to make a hole with his gimlet when he found a spigot he therefore placed his tankard under it and turned the spout something whatever it was the cask contained fell silently into the tankard	225.45263864214812
Whilst he was thinking that he should first taste the liquor which the tankard contained before taking it to his companions the door of the cellar opened and a man with a lantern in his hands and enveloped in a cloak came and stood just before the hogshead behind which Grimaud on hearing him come in instantly crept	158.93402039936998
He was accompanied by another man who carried in his hand something long and flexible rolled up resembling a washing line	282.4786611456038
His face was hidden under the wide brim of his hat	56.846536504836
Grimaud thinking that they had come as he had to try the port wine effaced himself behind his cask and consoled himself with the reflection that if he were discovered the crime was not a great one	139.2464262484529
Have you the wick asked the one who carried the lantern	57.674570967778386
Here it is answered the other	479.5534590178011
At the voice of this last speaker Grimaud started and felt a shudder creeping through his very marrow	540.1613041604938
He rose gently so that his head was just above the round of the barrel and under the large hat he recognized the pale face of Mordaunt	66.49522664538304
How long will this fuse burn asked this person	2784.0891136600453
About five minutes replied the captain	2228.55322487576
That voice also was known to Grimaud	285.1471836340513
He looked from one to the other and after Mordaunt he recognized Groslow	432.7452222130752
Then tell the men to be in readinessdont tell them why now	462.1333699542376
When the clock strikes a quarter after midnight collect your men	1442.9802026003733
That is when I have lighted the match	916.0182172827932
I wish to be sure of my revenge	116.42869187483855
Are the oars in the boat	1164.9543753621085
Mordaunt knelt down and fastened one end of the train to the spigot in order that he might have nothing to do but to set it on fire at the opposite end with the match	74.72502163311728
You hear meat a quarter past midnightin fact in twenty minutes	567.0980426551125
I understand all perfectly sir replied Groslow but allow me to say there is great danger in what you undertake would it not be better to intrust one of the men to set fire to the train	120.18608119479867
My dear Groslow answered Mordaunt you know the French proverb Nothing one does not do ones self is ever well done	334.2178511504748
I shall abide by that rule	16580.102242320954
Grimaud had heard all this if he had not understood it	39.71513686605468
But what he saw made good what he lacked in perfect comprehension of the language	587.7074126895684
He had seen the two mortal enemies of the musketeers had seen Mordaunt adjust the fuse he had heard the proverb which Mordaunt had given in French	350.1729888187208
Then he felt and felt again the contents of the tankard he held in his hand and instead of the lively liquor expected by Blaisois and Mousqueton he found beneath his fingers the grains of some coarse powder	130.77964042075448
Mordaunt went away with the captain	19376.54402153597
At the door he stopped to listen	48.94177460038192
Do you hear how they sleep he asked	193.1757409447302
In fact Porthos could be heard snoring through the partition	601.638180874847
Tis God who gives them into our hands answered Groslow	426.1421588840808
This time the devil himself shall not save them rejoined Mordaunt	893.0891046844686
End of the Port Wine Mystery	3996.7611256120194
Grimaud waited till he heard the bolt grind in the lock and when he was satisfied that he was alone he slowly rose from his recumbent posture	103.93284392458614
Ah he said wiping with his sleeve large drops of sweat from his forehead how lucky it was that Mousqueton was thirsty	206.91603621107868
He made haste to pass out by the opening still thinking himself in a dream but the sight of the gunpowder in the tankard proved to him that his dream was a fatal nightmare	111.75254331488674
It may be imagined that DArtagnan listened to these details with increasing interest before Grimaud had finished he rose without noise and putting his mouth to Aramiss ear and at the same time touching him on the shoulder to prevent a sudden movement	154.8991623378937
Chevalier he said get up and do nt make the least noise	100.48755477767715
DArtagnan pressing his hand repeated his call	271.33179665976195
Athos is near you said DArtagnan warn him as I have warned you	138.63131628043288
Aramis easily aroused Athos whose sleep was light like that of all persons of a finely organized constitution	287.61903812786005
But there was more difficulty in arousing Porthos	4078.401290466203
He was beginning to ask full explanation of that breaking in on his sleep which was very annoying to him when DArtagnan instead of explaining closed his mouth with his hand	203.4516072636513
Then our Gascon extending his arms drew to him the heads of his three friends till they almost touched one another	133.60981802130556
Friends he said we must leave this craft at once or we are dead men	125.1149878485434
Bah said Athos are you still afraid	396.7045228308999
Do you know who is captain of this vessel	145.01369089107834
The shudder of the three musketeers showed to DArtagnan that his words began to make some impression on them	168.77470079090392
Who is this Groslow asked Porthos	2528.339617303718
Groslow is the man who broke Parrys head and is now getting ready to break ours	854.2846709956574
And do you know who is his lieutenant	237.51461272965926
His lieutenant There is none said Athos	277.223898520956
They do nt have lieutenants in a felucca manned by a crew of four	179.05545983448445
Yes but Monsieur Groslow is not a captain of the ordinary kind he has a lieutenant and that lieutenant is Monsieur Mordaunt	190.04654652487093
This time the musketeers did more than shudderthey almost cried out	1044.8346299720338
Those invincible men were subject to a mysterious and fatal influence which that name had over them the mere sound of it filled them with terror	125.83143838668535
What shall we do said Athos	1783.7141247680995
We must seize the felucca said Aramis	205.826634630794
The felucca is mined said DArtagnan	408.2142597145924
Those casks which I took for casks of port wine are filled with powder	299.8430437324019
When Mordaunt finds himself discovered he will destroy all friends and foes and on my word he would be bad company in going either to Heaven or to hell	225.47656041982012
You have some plan then asked Athos	444.6201408797666
Give your orders said the three musketeers	5647.078463383652
DArtagnan went toward a very small low window just large enough to let a man through	230.42033338417338
He turned it gently on its hinges	10.40630999617141
There he said is our road	453.1517915151132
The deuce it is a very cold one my dear friend said Aramis	97.54580155174465
Stay here if you like but I warn you twill be rather too warm presently	363.5302733195089
But we can not swim to the shore	60.919450175428764
The longboat is yonder lashed to the felucca	125.40675311456461
We will take possession of it and cut the cable	325.5518821292471
A moments delay said Athos our servants	60.98057741168361
Meantime the three friends were standing motionless before the awful sight which DArtagnan in raising the shutters had disclosed to them through the narrow opening of the window	187.95594188245153
Those who have once beheld such a spectacle know that there is nothing more solemn more striking than the raging sea rolling with its deafening roar its dark billows beneath the pale light of a wintry moon	219.3750605764961
Gracious Heaven we are hesitating cried DArtagnan if we hesitate what will the servants do	246.7661939558536
I do not hesitate you know said Grimaud	606.0495563806268
Sir interposed Blaisois I warn you that I can only swim in rivers	84.59582343337007
And I not at all said Mousqueton	526.4132645827908
But DArtagnan had now slipped through the window	21.091889526927485
You have decided friend said Athos	6382.215180627165
Yes the Gascon answered Athos you who are a perfect being bid spirit triumph over body	782.8892663077484
Do you Aramis order the servants	157.90944445019034
Porthos kill every one who stands in your way	176.2555871067813
And after pressing the hand of Athos DArtagnan chose a moment when the ship rolled backward so that he had only to plunge into the water which was already up to his waist	143.3397755832547
Athos followed him before the felucca rose again on the waves the cable which tied the boat to the vessel was then seen plainly rising out of the sea	214.6902263509016
DArtagnan swam to it and held it suspending himself by this rope his head alone out of water	207.15121970111613
In one second Athos joined him	8.37880249343849
Then they saw as the felucca turned two other heads peeping those of Aramis and Grimaud	1201.751925621978
I am uneasy about Blaisois said Athos he can he says only swim in rivers	701.3697352536097
When people can swim at all they can swim anywhere	694.4254162928924
To the boat to the boat	508.37956897253315
But Porthos I do not see him	15.43473586979058
Porthos is cominghe swims like Leviathan	216412.31213610407
In fact Porthos did not appear for a scene half tragedy and half comedy had been performed by him with Mousqueton and Blaisois who frightened by the noise of the sea by the whistling of the wind by the sight of that dark water yawning like a gulf beneath them shrank back instead of going forward	164.14274800821335
Come come said Porthos jump in	27.90987156722768
But monsieur said Mousqueton I ca nt swim let me stay here	97.70443546020063
And me too monsieur said Blaisois	19978.43258355096
I assure you I shall be very much in the way in that little boat said Mousqueton	99.86549871383508
And I know I shall drown before reaching it continued Blaisois	3376.502876849004
Come along I shall strangle you both if you do nt get out said Porthos at last seizing Mousqueton by the throat	148.21517891371448
A groan stifled by the grasp of Porthos was all the reply of poor Blaisois for the giant taking him neck and heels plunged him into the water headforemost pushing him out of the window as if he had been a plank	165.2013170634288
Now Mousqueton he said I hope you do nt mean to desert your master	121.11151382109458
Ah sir replied Mousqueton his eyes filling with tears why did you reenter the army We were all so happy in the Chateau de Pierrefonds	169.5673639421119
And without any other complaint passive and obedient either from true devotion to his master or from the example set by Blaisois Mousqueton leaped into the sea headforemost	481.0174962819616
A sublime action at all events for Mousqueton looked upon himself as dead	263.91946934860925
But Porthos was not a man to abandon an old servant and when Mousqueton rose above the water blind as a newborn puppy he found he was supported by the large hand of Porthos and that he was thus enabled without having occasion even to move to advance toward the cable with the dignity of a very triton	168.83915739845006
In a few minutes Porthos had rejoined his companions who were already in the boat but when after they had all got in it came to his turn there was great danger that in putting his huge leg over the edge of the boat he would upset the little vessel	168.34017009899532
Athos was the last to enter	42.380157097206
Are you all here he asked	3.315055242776993
Ah have you your sword Athos cried DArtagnan	8424.279191439266
Athos drew a sharp poniard from his belt and cut the cord	44.14961557041
The felucca went on the boat continued stationary rocked only by the swashing waves	3343.113550148336
Come Athos said DArtagnan giving his hand to the count you are going to see something curious added the Gascon	31.665712281825904
Scarcely had DArtagnan uttered these words when a ringing and sudden noise was heard resounding through the felucca which had now become dim in the obscurity of the night	74.51823457276849
That you may be sure said the Gascon means something	222.89941467461108
They then at the same instant perceived a large lantern carried on a pole appear on the deck defining the forms of shadows behind it	295.73578672278546
Suddenly a terrible cry a cry of despair was wafted through space and as if the shrieks of anguish had driven away the clouds the veil which hid the moon was cleated away and the gray sails and dark shrouds of the felucca were plainly visible beneath the silvery light	156.36036921560677
Shadows ran as if bewildered to and fro on the vessel and mournful cries accompanied these delirious walkers	532.859658837766
In the midst of these screams they saw Mordaunt upon the poop with a torch in hand	387.3261891376646
The agitated figures apparently wild with terror consisted of Groslow who at the hour fixed by Mordaunt had collected his men and the sailors	192.14359629107219
Mordaunt after having listened at the door of the cabin to hear if the musketeers were still asleep had gone down into the cellar convinced by their silence that they were all in a deep slumber	95.66064768208892
Then he had run to the train impetuous as a man who is excited by revenge and full of confidence as are those whom God blinds he had set fire to the wick of nitre	274.28610362884154
All this while Groslow and his men were assembled on deck	303.8174199893116
Haul up the cable and draw the boat to us said Groslow	290.8004002453657
One of the sailors got down the side of the ship seized the cable and drew it it came without the least resistance	105.80916509727165
The cable is cut he cried no boat	895.4231188954373
How no boat exclaimed Groslow it is impossible	31.83086016580342
Tis true however answered the sailor there s nothing in the wake of the ship besides heres the end of the cable	185.9777335147819
What s the matter cried Mordaunt who coming up out of the hatchway rushed to the stern waving his torch	196.26697385561275
Only that our enemies have escaped they have cut the cord and gone off with the boat	130.0407483159877
Mordaunt bounded with one step to the cabin and kicked open the door	75.80170280897471
Empty he exclaimed the infernal demons	22506.549227589265
We must pursue them said Groslow they ca nt be gone far and we will sink them passing over them	165.46266995942193
Yes but the fire ejaculated Mordaunt I have lighted it	212.64861801730788
Ten thousand devils cried Groslow rushing to the hatchway perhaps there is still time to save us	108.47919091901281
Mordaunt answered only by a terrible laugh threw his torch into the sea and plunged in after it	112.7913422963351
The instant Groslow put his foot upon the hatchway steps the ship opened like the crater of a volcano	130.20060764004106
A burst of flame rose toward the skies with an explosion like that of a hundred cannon the air burned ignited by flaming embers then the frightful lightning disappeared the brands sank one after another into the abyss where they were extinguished and save for a slight vibration in the air after a few minutes had elapsed one would have thought that nothing had happened	184.76616347542134
Onlythe felucca had disappeared from the surface of the sea and Groslow and his three sailors were consumed	147.84136325104961
The four friends saw all thisnot a single detail of this fearful scene escaped them	510.25978439174435
At one moment bathed as they were in a flood of brilliant light which illumined the sea for the space of a league they might each be seen each by his own peculiar attitude and manner expressing the awe which even in their hearts of bronze they could not help experiencing	175.30267193058833
Soon a torrent of vivid sparks fell around themthen at last the volcano was extinguishedthen all was dark and stillthe floating bark and heaving ocean	1134.1167689743743
By Heaven at last said Athos the first to speak by this time I think all must be over	101.79020572373305
Here my lords save me help cried a voice whose mournful accents reaching the four friends seemed to proceed from some phantom of the ocean	307.3523662493687
All looked around Athos himself stared	59944.759459979825
Tis he it is his voice	57.64283623565014
All still remained silent the eyes of all were turned in the direction where the vessel had disappeared endeavoring in vain to penetrate the darkness	77.90507015405778
After a minute or two they were able to distinguish a man who approached them swimming vigorously	224.78907093354536
Athos extended his arm toward him pointing him out to his companions	85.07091117625814
Yes yes I see him well enough said DArtagnan	226.7791147472096
Heagain cried Porthos who was breathing like a blacksmiths bellows why he is made of iron	594.6277528164163
Aramis and DArtagnan whispered to each other	30.551655875840783
Mordaunt made several strokes more and raising his arm in sign of distress above the waves Pity pity on me gentlemen in Heavens name my strength is failing me I am dying	179.92057261081828
The voice that implored aid was so piteous that it awakened pity in the heart of Athos	168.92449058359833
Indeed said DArtagnan monsters have only to complain to gain your sympathy	165.20885011557718
I believe he s swimming toward us	546.0886599700507
Does he think we are going to take him in Row Porthos row	430.3264777116165
And setting the example he plowed his oar into the sea two strokes took the bark on twenty fathoms further	399.7900084549721
Oh you will not abandon me You will not leave me to perish You will not be pitiless cried Mordaunt	81.22466381749118
Ah ah said Porthos to Mordaunt I think we have you now my hero and there are no doors by which you can escape this time but those of hell	163.01240520810154
Oh Porthos murmured the Comte de la Fere	4.570358959300916
Oh pray for mercys sake do nt fly from me	64.34960325406956
For pitys sake cried the young man whose agonydrawn breath at times when his head went under water under the wave exhaled and made the icy waters bubble	391.18607476243386
DArtagnan however who had consulted with Aramis spoke to the poor wretch	107.02755993051085
Go away he said your repentance is too recent to inspire confidence	656.1641205354642
See the vessel in which you wished to fry us is still smoking and the situation in which you are is a bed of roses compared to that in which you wished to place us and in which you have placed Monsieur Groslow and his companions	138.04653497697117
Sir replied Mordaunt in a tone of deep despair my penitence is sincere	139.6416503448089
Gentlemen I am young scarcely twentythree years old	222.25240156179936
I was drawn on by a very natural resentment to avenge my mother	143.21131341261352
You would have done what I did	21.58383498064413
Mordaunt wanted now only two or three fathoms to reach the boat for the approach of death seemed to give him supernatural strength	104.2028792490636
Alas he said I am then to die You are going to kill the son as you killed the mother Surely if I am culpable and if I ask for pardon I ought to be forgiven	87.49535585137346
Then as if his strength failed him he seemed unable to sustain himself above the water and a wave passed over his head which drowned his voice	112.46077195577092
Oh this is torture to me cried Athos	416.6029703269866
For my part said DArtagnan I say this must come to an end murderer as you were of your uncle executioner as you were of King Charles incendiary I recommend you to sink forthwith to the bottom of the sea and if you come another fathom nearer Ill stave your wicked head in with this oar	304.2390217231427
DArtagnan DArtagnan cried Athos my son I entreat you the wretch is dying and it is horrible to let a man die without extending a hand to save him	81.74208419150885
I can not resist doing so he must live	51.50475702793016
Zounds replied DArtagnan why do nt you give yourself up directly feet and hands bound to that wretch Ah Comte de la Fere you wish to perish by his hands I your son as you call meI will not let you	120.96806626252464
Twas the first time DArtagnan had ever refused a request from Athos	265.0207431417102
Aramis calmly drew his sword which he had carried between his teeth as he swam	50.91069517713904
If he lays his hand on the boats edge I will cut it off regicide that he is	190.38171715561444
What are you going to do asked Aramis	97.97656140254439
Throw myself in the water and strangle him	180.05674196024952
Oh gentlemen cried Athos be men be Christians See death is depicted on his face Ah do not bring on me the horrors of remorse Grant me this poor wretchs life	509.6809481481873
I am dying cried Mordaunt come to me come to me	87.41516609521366
The boat at this moment turned around and the dying man was by that turn brought nearer Athos	320.8569537411359
Monsieur the Comte de la Fere he cried I supplicate you pity me I call on youwhere are you I see you no longerI am dyinghelp me help me	297.53926216564196
Here I am sir said Athos leaning and stretching out his arm to Mordaunt with that air of dignity and nobility of soul habitual to him here I am take my hand and jump into our boat	188.92883710499473
Mordaunt made a last effortroseseized the hand thus extended to him and grasped it with the vehemence of despair	83.80504514311434
That s right said Athos put your other hand here	988.8743235667506
And he offered him his shoulder as another stay and support so that his head almost touched that of Mordaunt and these two mortal enemies were in as close an embrace as if they had been brothers	239.46733435955372
Now sir said the count you are safecalm yourself	125.3025574987671
Ah my mother cried Mordaunt with eyes on fire with a look of hate impossible to paint I can only offer thee one victim but it shall at any rate be the one thou wouldst thyself have chosen	331.3896665380813
And whilst DArtagnan uttered a cry Porthos raised the oar and Aramis sought a place to strike a frightful shake given to the boat precipitated Athos into the sea whilst Mordaunt with a shout of triumph grasped the neck of his victim and in order to paralyze his movements twined arms and legs around the musketeer	279.99842077671866
For an instant without an exclamation without a cry for help Athos tried to sustain himself on the surface of the waters but the weight dragged him down he disappeared by degrees soon nothing was to be seen except his long floating hair then both men disappeared and the bubbling of the water which in its turn was soon effaced alone indicated the spot where these two had sunk	160.08828150448764
Mute with horror the three friends had remained openmouthed their eyes dilated their arms extended like statues and motionless as they were the beating of their hearts was audible	228.9429195403299
Porthos was the first who came to himself	72.67610778094037
Oh he cried Athos Athos thou man of noble heart woe is me I have let thee perish	327.64593669137145
At this instant in the midst of the silver circle illumined by the light of the moon the same whirlpool which had been made by the sinking men was again obvious and first were seen rising above the waves a wisp of hair then a pale face with open eyes yet nevertheless the eyes of death then a body which after rising of itself even to the waist above the sea turned gently on its back according to the caprice of the waves and floated	159.90560142196162
In the bosom of this corpse was plunged a poniard the gold hilt of which shone in the moonbeams	200.42968201572398
Mordaunt Mordaunt cried the three friends tis Mordaunt	4032.061997345917
Suddenly the boat leaned on one side beneath a new and unexpected weight and Grimaud uttered a shout of joy every one turned around and beheld Athos livid his eyes dim and his hands trembling supporting himself on the edge of the boat	167.21888859564467
Eight vigorous arms lifted him up immediately and laid him in the boat where directly Athos was warmed and reanimated reviving with the caresses and cares of his friends who were intoxicated with joy	278.84510485026277
You are not hurt asked DArtagnan	9876.83605529062
Oh he now we may say at last thank Heaven he is really dead	155.93899320322274
Look and DArtagnan obliging Athos to look in the direction he pointed showed him the body of Mordaunt floating on its back which sometimes submerged sometimes rising seemed still to pursue the four friends with looks of insult and mortal hatred	269.86496723145314
Athos had followed him with a glance in which the deepest melancholy and pity were expressed	123.87186837285111
Bravo Athos cried Aramis with an emotion very rare in him	371.8845559231403
A capital blow you gave cried Porthos	23002.042580078556
I wished to live said Athos	2246.8525137868937
In short said DArtagnan this has been the will of God	36.2870707279936
It was not I who killed him said Athos in a soft low tone twas destiny	358.78709771676836
How Mousqueton had a Narrow Escape of being eaten	540.998770786939
A deep silence reigned for a long time in the boat after the fearful scene described	92.8585707343861
The moon which had shone for a short time disappeared behind the clouds every object was again plunged in the obscurity that is so awful in the deserts and still more so in that liquid desert the ocean and nothing was heard save the whistling of the west wind driving along the tops of the crested billows	215.90682636231435
Porthos was the first to speak	104.99017432096849
I have seen he said many dreadful things but nothing that ever agitated me so much as what I have just witnessed	144.63655673135418
Nevertheless even in my present state of perturbation I protest that I feel happy	272.97982051845725
I have a hundred pounds weight less upon my chest	714.2610980415701
In fact Porthos breathed so loud as to do credit to the free play of his powerful lungs	187.6114062993212
For my part observed Aramis I can not say the same as you do Porthos	53.9053611282648
I am still terrified to such a degree that I scarcely believe my eyes	81.02589280797588
I look around the boat expecting every moment to see that poor wretch holding between his hands the poniard plunged into his heart	144.56044366275836
Oh I feel easy replied Porthos	15558.818308224612
The poniard was pointed at the sixth rib and buried up to the hilt in his body	102.48470063853816
I do not reproach you Athos for what you have done	98.01947818360736
On the contrary when one aims a blow that is the regulation way to strike	571.0222381932603
So now I breathe againI am happy	56.58635694985112
Do nt be in haste to celebrate a victory Porthos interposed DArtagnan never have we incurred a greater danger than we are now encountering	886.2193263999857
Men may subdue menthey can not overcome the elements	192.80589468253623
We are now on the sea at night without any pilot in a frail bark should a blast of wind upset the boat we are lost	359.3559378577306
You are ungrateful DArtagnan said Athos yes ungrateful to Providence to whom we owe our safety in the most miraculous manner	128.44029715563173
Let us sail before the wind and unless it changes we shall be drifted either to Calais or Boulogne	476.10391906712596
Should our bark be upset we are five of us good swimmers able enough to turn it over again or if not to hold on by it	163.03676687893937
Now we are on the very road which all the vessels between Dover and Calais take tis impossible but that we should meet with a fisherman who will pick us up	219.3599152056629
But should we not find any fisherman and should the wind shift to the north	475.8079709278769
That said Athos would be quite another thing and we should nevermore see land until we were upon the other side of the Atlantic	163.17775450086742
Which implies that we may die of hunger said Aramis	54.62785427936665
Tis more than possible answered the Comte de la Fere	13.686097121204991
Mousqueton sighed again more deeply than before	19.164452108790023
What is the matter what ails you asked Porthos	1004.3648909253493
I am cold sir said Mousqueton	11045.203172058007
Impossible your body is covered with a coating of fat which preserves it from the cold air	108.86671549197771
Ah sir tis this very coating of fat that makes me shiver	580.1980826547274
Alas your honor in the library of the Chateau of Bracieux there are a lot of books of travels	237.09840702628657
Amongst them the voyages of Jean Mocquet in the time of Henry IV	215.39678879180946
In these books your honor tis told how hungry voyagers drifting out to sea have a bad habit of eating each other and beginning with	743.9718900364173
The fattest among them cried DArtagnan unable in spite of the gravity of the occasion to help laughing	203.87778274902868
Yes sir answered Mousqueton but permit me to say I see nothing laughable in it	164.1581842913691
However he added turning to Porthos I should not regret dying sir were I sure that by doing so I might still be useful to you	275.0175185480469
Mouston replied Porthos much affected should we ever see my castle of Pierrefonds again you shall have as your own and for your descendants the vineyard that surrounds the farm	315.06719708992625
And you should call it Devotion added Aramis the vineyard of selfsacrifice to transmit to latest ages the recollection of your devotion to your master	513.33153610372
Chevalier said DArtagnan laughing you could eat a piece of Mouston could nt you especially after two or three days of fasting	222.72880642078655
Oh no replied Aramis I should much prefer Blaisois we have nt known him so long	643.7334230775557
One may readily conceive that during these jokes which were intended chiefly to divert Athos from the scene which had just taken place the servants with the exception of Grimaud were not silent	136.42918008037933
Suddenly Mousqueton uttered a cry of delight taking from beneath one of the benches a bottle of wine and on looking more closely in the same place he discovered a dozen similar bottles bread and a monster junk of salted beef	152.5245344305963
Oh sir he cried passing the bottle to Porthos we are savedthe bark is supplied with provisions	790.6205976946551
This intelligence restored every one save Athos to gayety	8326.556700426216
Zounds exclaimed Porthos tis astonishing how empty violent agitation makes the stomach	507.86537416165174
And he drank off half a bottle at a draught and bit great mouthfuls of the bread and meat	259.3390469793038
Now said Athos sleep or try to sleep my friends and I will watch	57.442194593630944
In a few moments notwithstanding their wet clothes the icy blast that blew and the previous scene of terror these hardy adventurers with their iron frames inured to every hardship threw themselves down intending to profit by the advice of Athos who sat at the helm pensively wakeful guiding the little bark the way it was to go his eyes fixed on the heavens as if he sought to verify not only the road to France but the benign aspect of protecting Providence	324.3852016115193
After some hours of repose the sleepers were aroused by Athos	504.0066352650834
Dawn was shedding its pallid placid glimmer on the purple ocean when at the distance of a musket shot from them was seen a dark gray mass above which gleamed a triangular sail then masters and servants joined in a fervent cry to the crew of that vessel to hear them and to save	213.22216787170473
It was in fact a small craft from Dunkirk bound for Boulogne	2964.4361429142805
A quarter of an hour afterward the rowboat of this craft took them all aboard	912.8635118108406
Grimaud tendered twenty guineas to the captain and at nine oclock in the morning having a fair wind our Frenchmen set foot on their native land	117.037215103546
Egad how strong one feels here said Porthos almost burying his large feet in the sands	324.87130305389815
Zounds I could defy a nation	8437.742903176413
Be quiet Porthos said DArtagnan we are observed	105.82400847286758
We are admired ifaith answered Porthos	5131.350705427193
These people who are looking at us are only merchants said Athos and are looking more at the cargo than at us	305.507841410597
I shall not trust to that said the lieutenant and I shall make for the Dunes as soon as possible	70.58306060952823
Sandy hills about Dunkirk from which it derives its name	499.0952812265963
The party followed him and soon disappeared with him behind the hillocks of sand unobserved	495.67497032474364
Here after a short conference they proposed to separate	369.5960588696979
Because answered the Gascon we were sent Porthos and I by Cardinal Mazarin to fight for Cromwell instead of fighting for Cromwell we have served Charles I	435.34095025478507
not the same thing by any means	22.215790407135792
In returning with the Comte de la Fere and Monsieur dHerblay our crime would be confirmed	43.40883662903997
We have circumvented Cromwell Mordaunt and the sea but we shall find a certain difficulty in circumventing Mazarin	242.57389322493967
You forget replied Athos that we consider ourselves your prisoners and not free from the engagement we entered into	171.82067203607548
Truly Athos interrupted DArtagnan I am vexed that such a man as you are should talk nonsense which schoolboys would be ashamed of	268.40640527667466
Chevalier he continued addressing Aramis who leaning proudly on his sword seemed to agree with his companion Chevalier Porthos and I run no risk besides should any illluck happen to two of us will it not be much better that the other two should be spared to assist those who may be apprehended Besides who knows whether divided we may not obtain a pardonyou from the queen we from Mazarinwhich were we all four together would never be granted	294.2950120699014
Come Athos and Aramis go to the right Porthos come with me to the left these gentlemen should file off into Normandy whilst we by the nearest road reach Paris	343.981680896693
He then gave his friends minute directions as to their route	1207.7615425181623
Ah my dear friend exclaimed Athos how I should admire the resources of your mind did I not stop to adore those of your heart	177.99855085292285
And he gave him his hand	20.60415322115495
Is nt this fox a genius Athos asked the Gascon	353.21789998468813
No he knows how to crunch fowls to dodge the huntsman and to find his way home by day or by night that s all	326.66530489897696
Then lets count our money and divide it	359.50195318790685
Ah hurrah there s the sun A merry morning to you Sunshine	676.7872074681925
Tis a long time since I saw thee	134.0177782370592
Come come DArtagnan said Athos do not affect to be strongminded there are tears in your eyes	100.70273420086446
Let us be open with each other and sincere	92.35498760404192
What cried the Gascon do you think Athos we can take leave calmly of two friends at a time not free from danger to you and Aramis	152.57327961692545
No answered Athos embrace me my son	63.445493948489904
Zounds said Porthos sobbing I believe I m crying but how foolish all this is	226.42954867224512
At that moment their fraternal bond of union was closer than ever and when they parted each to take the route agreed on they turned back to utter affectionate expressions which the echoes of the Dunes repeated	379.85460155048133
At last they lost sight of each other	8.904060589953673
Sacrebleu DArtagnan said Porthos I must out with it at once for I ca nt keep to myself anything I have against you I have nt been able to recognize you in this matter	54.152400856320504
Why not said DArtagnan with his wise smile	225.33799300535497
Because if as you say Athos and Aramis are in real danger this is not the time to abandon them	132.42561683944572
For my part I confess to you that I was all ready to follow them and am still ready to rejoin them in spite of all the Mazarins in the world	49.196141064590456
You would be right Porthos but for one thing which may change the current of your ideas and that is that it is not those gentlemen who are in the greatest danger it is ourselves it is not to abandon them that we have separated but to avoid compromising them	95.66916524627013
Really said Porthos opening his eyes in astonishment	18.458887104597434
If they are arrested they will only be put in the Bastile if we are arrested it is a matter of the Place de Greve	104.71306091817421
Oh oh said Porthos there is quite a gap between that fate and the baronial coronet you promised me DArtagnan	336.1943645131022
Bah perhaps not so great as you think Porthos you know the proverb All roads lead to Rome	415.09436316918936
But how is it that we are incurring greater risks than Athos and Aramis asked Porthos	565.0505278992614
Because they have but fulfilled the mission confided to them by Queen Henrietta and we have betrayed that confided to us by Mazarin because going hence as emissaries to Cromwell we became partisans of King Charles because instead of helping cut off the royal head condemned by those fellows called Mazarin Cromwell Joyce Bridge Fairfax etc	1018.5760306383013
we very nearly succeeded in saving it	850.2918133020513
Upon my word that is true said Porthos but how can you suppose my dear friend that in the midst of his great preoccupations General Cromwell has had time to think	119.93253091896881
Cromwell thinks of everything Cromwell has time for everything and believe me dear friend we ought not to lose our timeit is precious	158.7928908816614
We shall not be safe till we have seen Mazarin and then	100.77798304564708
The devil said Porthos what can we say to Mazarin	171.25835520272912
Leave that to meI have my plan	370.9066956334178
He laughs best who laughs last	37770.17954639369
Cromwell is mighty Mazarin is tricky but I would rather have to do with them than with the late Monsieur Mordaunt	141.1013876473907
Ah said Porthos it is very pleasant to be able to say the late Monsieur Mordaunt	132.32291355368704
The two immediately started across country toward the road to Paris followed by Mousqueton who after being too cold all night at the end of a quarter of an hour found himself too warm	70.7244982175093
During the six weeks that Athos and Aramis had been absent from France the Parisians finding themselves one morning without either queen or king were greatly annoyed at being thus deserted and the absence of Mazarin a thing so long desired did not compensate for that of the two august fugitives	403.93499427851424
The first feeling that pervaded Paris on hearing of the flight to Saint Germain was that sort of affright which seizes children when they awake in the night and find themselves alone	194.92635671731622
A deputation was therefore sent to the queen to entreat her to return to Paris but she not only declined to receive the deputies but sent an intimation by Chancellor Seguier implying that if the parliament did not humble itself before her majesty by negativing all the questions that had been the cause of the quarrel Paris would be besieged the very next day	199.62655077709857
This threatening answer unluckily for the court produced quite a different effect to that which was intended	172.9391427695077
It wounded the pride of the parliament which supported by the citizens replied by declaring that Cardinal Mazarin was the cause of all the discontent denounced him as the enemy both of the king and the state and ordered him to retire from the court that same day and from France within a week afterward enjoining in case of disobedience on his part all the subjects of the king to pursue and take him	159.98481060138977
Mazarin being thus placed beyond the pale of the protection of the law preparations on both sides were commencedby the queen to attack Paris by the citizens to defend it	201.7836361364737
The latter were occupied in breaking up the pavement and stretching chains across the streets when headed by the coadjutor appeared the Prince de Conti the brother of the Prince de Cond and the Duc de Longueville his brotherinlaw	181.68682628245898
This unexpected band of auxiliaries arrived in Paris on the tenth of January and the Prince of Conti was named but not until after a stormy discussion generalissimo of the army of the king out of Paris	200.61002041305457
As for the Duc de Beaufort he arrived from Vendome according to the annals of the day bringing with him his high bearing and his long and beautiful hair qualifications which gained him the sovereignty of the marketplaces	209.42872078572367
The Parisian army had organized with the promptness characteristic of the bourgeois whenever they are moved by any sentiment whatever to disguise themselves as soldiers	376.8579614838302
On the nineteenth the impromptu army had attempted a sortie more to assure itself and others of its actual existence than with any more serious intention	404.556063404443
They carried a banner on which could be read this strange device We are seeking our king	353.2337437459595
The next following days were occupied in trivial movements which resulted only in the carrying off of a few herds of cattle and the burning of two or three houses	237.3573587427505
That was still the situation of affairs up to the early days of February	163.80935331155607
On the first day of that month our four companions had landed at Boulogne and in two parties had set out for Paris	231.3031854375924
Toward the end of the fourth day of the journey Athos and Aramis reached Nanterre which place they cautiously passed by on the outskirts fearing that they might encounter some troop from the queens army	435.9087595277272
It was against his will that Athos took these precautions but Aramis had very judiciously reminded him that they had no right to be imprudent that they had been charged by King Charles with a supreme and sacred mission which received at the foot of the scaffold could be accomplished only at the feet of Queen Henrietta	154.44255370965914
On reaching the capital Athos and Aramis found it in arms	138.289097385443
The sentinel at the gate refused even to let them pass and called his sergeant	299.25247149806466
The sergeant with the air of importance which such people assume when they are clad with military dignity said	203.02729511232627
And where do you come from	32.2592848582902
And what are you going to do in Paris	15.702217226023324
We are going with a mission to Her Majesty the Queen of England	165.29297326854095
Ah every one seems to be going to see the queen of England	45.635817602749846
We have already at the station three gentlemen whose passports are under examination who are on their way to her majesty	345.42008174073396
We have none we left England ignorant of the state of politics here having left Paris before the departure of the king	153.04722924584127
Ah said the sergeant with a cunning smile you are Mazarinists who are sent as spies	169.89745043205536
My dear friend here Athos spoke rest assured if we were Mazarinists we should come well prepared with every sort of passport	386.70511232755666
In your situation distrust those who are well provided with every formality	137.3442029280245
Enter the guardroom said the sergeant we will lay your case before the commandant of the post	269.3760609284037
The guardroom was filled with citizens and common people some playing some drinking some talking	2065.073971205184
In a corner almost hidden from view were three gentlemen who had preceded Athos and Aramis and an officer was examining their passports	320.7669539048416
The first impulse of these three and of those who last entered was to cast an inquiring glance at each other	124.52309804752669
The first arrivals wore long cloaks in whose drapery they were carefully enveloped one of them shorter than the rest remained pertinaciously in the background	259.6879015976606
When the sergeant on entering the room announced that in all probability he was bringing in two Mazarinists it appeared to be the unanimous opinion of the officers on guard that they ought not to pass	120.51731074423932
Be it so said Athos yet it is probable on the contrary that we shall enter because we seem to have to do with sensible people	102.9529619228753
There seems to be only one thing to do which is to send our names to Her Majesty the Queen of England and if she engages to answer for us I presume we shall be allowed to enter	99.20347177779138
On hearing these words the shortest of the other three men seemed more attentive than ever to what was going on wrapping his cloak around him more carefully than before	161.14663929545912
Merciful goodness whispered Aramis to Athos did you see	212.27459830604073
The face of the shortest of those three gentlemen	249.01001804717208
He looked to mebut tis impossible	61.556534735534896
At this instant the sergeant who had been for his orders returned and pointing to the three gentlemen in cloaks said	112.08030216008716
The passports are in order let these three gentlemen pass	513.1026103459333
The three gentlemen bowed and hastened to take advantage of this permission	54.44287876692913
Aramis looked after them and as the last of them passed close to him he pressed the hand of Athos	91.93203583209645
What is the matter with you my friend asked the latter	28.668811019035513
I havedoubtless I am dreaming tell me sir he said to the sergeant do you know those three gentlemen who are just gone out	71.56649148903266
Only by their passports they are three Frondists who are gone to rejoin the Duc de Longueville	85.82602590829512
Tis strange said Aramis almost involuntarily I fancied that I recognized Mazarin himself	732.7967300646002
The sergeant burst into a fit of laughter	12.093034580595384
He he cried he venture himself amongst us to be hung Not so foolish as all that	146.07589704662644
Ah muttered Athos I may be mistaken I have nt the unerring eye of DArtagnan	133.42238859049647
Who is speaking of Monsieur DArtagnan asked an officer who appeared at that moment upon the threshold of the room	76.83397198259063
What cried Aramis and Athos what Planchet	2292.2151227034515
Planchet added Grimaud Planchet with a gorget indeed	734.30065551687
Ah gentlemen cried Planchet so you are back again in Paris	88.56098882515246
Oh how happy you make us no doubt you come to join the princes	73.59558742729668
As thou seest Planchet said Aramis whilst Athos smiled on seeing what important rank was held in the city militia by the former comrade of Mousqueton Bazin and Grimaud	676.3386720420546
And Monsieur dArtagnan of whom you spoke just now Monsieur dHerblay may I ask if you have any news of him	49.598971247354015
We parted from him four days ago and we have reason to believe that he has reached Paris before us	52.441052456372766
No sir I am sure he has nt yet arrived	398.089853355762
But then he may have stopped at Saint Germain	363.0334614704891
I do nt think so we appointed to meet at La Chevrette	924.843231921068
I was there this very day	242.8267422352968
And had the pretty Madeleine no news asked Aramis smiling	585.1294669065157
No sir and it must be admitted that she seemed very anxious	67.33804431964546
In fact said Aramis there is no time lost and we made our journey quickly	101.76567998112746
Permit me then my dear Athos without inquiring further about our friend to pay my respects to M	178.49276464787383
Ah monsieur le chevalier said Planchet bowing	1909.1348318860257
Lieutenant with a promise of becoming captain	2661.3741650393376
Tis capital and pray how did you acquire all these honors	147.36958200443817
In the first place gentlemen you know that I was the means of Monsieur de Rocheforts escape well I was very near being hung by Mazarin and that made me more popular than ever	133.44296016411582
You know gentlemen that I served the Piedmont regiment and had the honor of being a sergeant	167.5357851217086
Well one day when no one could drill a mob of citizens who began to march some with the right foot others with the left I succeeded I did in making them all begin with the same foot and I was made lieutenant on the spot	133.47344349727706
So I presume said Athos that you have a large number of the nobles with you	87.53553597898922
There are the Prince de Conti the Duc de Longueville the Duc de Beaufort the Duc de Bouillon the Marechal de la Mothe the Marquis de Sevigne and I do nt know who for my part	67.47043082117048
And the Vicomte Raoul de Bragelonne inquired Athos in a tremulous voice	237.91035848050421
DArtagnan told me that he had recommended him to your care in parting	245.343000787624
Yes count nor have I lost sight of him for a single instant since	37.11244403375793
Then said Athos in a tone of delight he is well no accident has happened to him	47.96202172694646
Still at the Hotel of the Great Charlemagne	1328.4884850425221
Sometimes with the queen of England sometimes with Madame de Chevreuse	300.53178264681804
He and the Count de Guiche are like each others shadows	949.7892459135595
Thanks Planchet thanks cried Athos extending his hand to the lieutenant	24.925077584230564
Oh sir Planchet only touched the tips of the counts fingers	119.74875395727615
Well what are you doing countto a former lackey	9059.965086000475
My friend said Athos he has given me news of Raoul	115.70393882236215
And now gentlemen said Planchet who had not heard what they were saying what do you intend to do	26.30806033648214
Reenter Paris if you will let us my good Planchet	485.17183450847847
Let you sir Now as ever I am nothing but your servant	200.98092157272953
Allow these gentlemen to pass he said they are friends of the Duc de Beaufort	45.96767209669636
Long live the Duc de Beaufort cried the sentinels	76.34887450950222
The sergeant drew near to Planchet	52051.315711512885
Take notice captain he continued giving Planchet his expected title take notice that one of the three men who just now went out from here told me privately to distrust these gentlemen	295.4640280268714
And I said Planchet with dignity I know them and I answer for them	143.54973300701323
As he said this he pressed Grimauds hand who seemed honored by the distinction	373.36284117785016
Farewell till we meet again said Aramis as they took leave of Planchet if anything happens to us we shall blame you for it	124.45508666810898
Sir said Planchet I am in all things at your service	46.42798981769766
That fellow is no fool said Aramis as he got on his horse	78.48012834493274
How should he be replied Athos whilst mounting also seeing he was used so long to brush your hats	738.5169296445981
The two friends rode rapidly down the declivity of the Faubourg but on arriving at the bottom were surprised to find that the streets of Paris had become rivers and the open places lakes after the great rains which fell in January the Seine had overflowed its banks and the river inundated half the capital	211.644073283842
The two gentlemen were obliged therefore to get off their horses and take a boat and in that strange manner they approached the Louvre	147.28850746666532
Night had closed in and Paris seen thus by the light of lanterns flickering on the pools of water crowded with ferryboats of every kind including those that glittered with the armed patrols with the watchword passing from post to postParis presented such an aspect as to strongly seize the senses of Aramis a man most susceptible to warlike impressions	568.6662892825472
They reached the queens apartments but were compelled to stop in the antechamber since her majesty was at that moment giving audience to gentlemen bringing her news from England	219.0802576940504
We too said Athos to the footman who had given him that answer not only bring news from England but have just come from there	86.74854652121904
What then are your names gentlemen	156.12281407457732
The Comte de la Fere and the Chevalier dHerblay said Aramis	175.49814046605334
Ah in that case gentlemen said the footman on hearing the names which the queen had so often pronounced with hope in that case it is another thing and I think her majesty will pardon me for not keeping you here a moment	66.86195840210068
Please follow me and he went on before followed by Athos and Aramis	129.35136183186296
On arriving at the door of the room where the queen was receiving he made a sign for them to wait and opening the door	30.945831946615815
Madame he said I hope your majesty will forgive me for disobeying your orders when you learn that the gentlemen I have come to announce are the Comte de la Fere and the Chevalier dHerblay	88.65334918238656
On hearing those two names the queen uttered a cry of joy which the two gentlemen heard	78.20590746615585
Oh let them come in let them come in cried the young princess bounding to the door	90.77188557114637
The poor child was constant in her attendance on her mother and sought by her filial attentions to make her forget the absence of her two sons and her other daughter	133.50591223500908
Come in gentlemen repeated the princess opening the door herself	393.4462345631102
The queen was seated on a fauteuil and before her were standing two or three gentlemen and among them the Duc de Chatillon the brother of the nobleman killed eight or nine years previously in a duel on account of Madame de Longueville on the Place Royale	90.69694318908377
All these gentlemen had been noticed by Athos and Aramis in the guardhouse and when the two friends were announced they started and exchanged some words in a low tone	78.70330865685847
Well sirs cried the queen on perceiving the two friends you have come faithful friends But the royal couriers have been more expeditious than you and here are Monsieur de Flamarens and Monsieur de Chatillon who bring me from Her Majesty the Queen Anne of Austria the very latest intelligence	196.60099922874514
Aramis and Athos were astounded by the calmness even the gayety of the queens manner	108.74231438163653
Go on with your recital sirs said the queen turning to the Duc de Chatillon	96.98142909905705
You said that His Majesty King Charles my august consort had been condemned to death by a majority of his subjects	297.6786124825084
Athos and Aramis were more and more astonished	39.10029245804249
And that being conducted to the scaffold resumed the queenoh my lord oh my kingand that being led to the scaffold he had been saved by an indignant people	184.92250771423448
Just so madame replied Chatillon in so low a voice that though the two friends were listening eagerly they could hardly hear this affirmation	118.54594678254945
The queen clasped her hands in enthusiastic gratitude whilst her daughter threw her arms around her mothers neck and kissed herher own eyes streaming with tears	171.92376076530195
Now madame nothing remains to me except to proffer my respectful homage said Chatillon who felt confused and ashamed beneath the stern gaze of Athos	491.40310200496947
One moment yes answered the queen	509.0400917546047
One momentI begfor here are the Chevalier dHerblay and the Comte de la Fere just arrived from London and they can give you as eyewitnesses such details as you can convey to the queen my royal sister	172.53815987694207
Speak gentlemen speakI am listening conceal nothing gloss over nothing	1945.7321870164824
Since his majesty still lives since the honor of the throne is safe everything else is a matter of indifference to me	69.87455273012594
Athos turned pale and laid his hand on his heart	5.499972669556341
Well exclaimed the queen who remarked this movement and his paleness	402.14369804696474
Speak sir I beg you to do so	7.620698662108947
I beg you to excuse me madame I wish to add nothing to the recital of these gentlemen until they perceive themselves that they have perhaps been mistaken	84.16361226603925
Mistaken cried the queen almost suffocated by emotion mistaken what has happened then	251.8662992408465
Sir interposed Monsieur de Flamarens to Athos if we are mistaken the error has originated with the queen	221.58703574991702
I do not suppose you will have the presumption to set it to rightsthat would be to accuse Her Majesty Queen Anne of falsehood	486.21484218272275
With the queen sir replied Athos in his calm vibrating voice	585.585079272515
Yes murmured Flamarens lowering his eyes	4.4216635711417736
Or rather sir said Aramis with his peculiar irritating politeness the error of the person who was with you when we met you in the guardroom for if the Comte de la Fere and I are not mistaken we saw you in the company of a third gentleman	74.8557809276855
Explain yourself count cried the queen whose anxiety grew greater every moment	1051.6075990593692
On your brow I read despairyour lips falter ere you announce some terrible tidingsyour hands tremble	3441.080927931836
Oh my God my God what has happened	28.619168007548375
Lord ejaculated the young princess falling on her knees have mercy on us	64.05437466975316
Sir said Chatillon if you bring bad tidings it will be cruel in you to announce them to the queen	94.20754804970171
Aramis went so close to Chatillon as almost to touch him	839.0702222597869
Sir said he with compressed lips and flashing eyes you have not the presumption to instruct the Comte de la Fere and myself what we ought to say here	81.65700683769154
During this brief altercation Athos with his hands on his heart his head bent low approached the queen and in a voice of deepest sorrow said	71.54006546890875
Madame princeswho by nature are above other menreceive from Heaven courage to support greater misfortunes than those of lower rank for their hearts are elevated as their fortunes	595.3092027699245
We ought not therefore I think to act toward a queen so illustrious as your majesty as we should act toward a woman of our lowlier condition	291.58398294891487
Queen destined as you are to endure every sorrow on this earth hear the result of our unhappy mission	242.27233208459612
Athos kneeling down before the queen trembling and very cold drew from his bosom inclosed in the same case the order set in diamonds which the queen had given to Lord de Winter and the wedding ring which Charles I	176.67814717723536
before his death had placed in the hands of Aramis	37.54552594593308
Since the moment he had first received these two mementoes Athos had never parted with them	657.3599268104931
He opened the case and offered them to the queen with deep and silent anguish	110.43414807703576
The queen stretched out her hand seized the ring pressed it convulsively to her lipsand without being able to breathe a sigh to give vent to a sob she extended her arms became deadly pale and fell senseless in the arms of her attendants and her daughter	81.84089120361794
Athos kissed the hem of the robe of the widowed queen and rising with a dignity that made a deep impression on those around	112.8656065781323
I the Comte de la Fere a gentleman who has never deceived any human being swear before God and before this unhappy queen that all that was possible to save the king of England was done whilst we were on English ground	154.0222973574084
Now chevalier he added turning to Aramis let us go	78.40827453616076
said Aramis we have still a word to say to these gentlemen	99.77294606213272
And turning to Chatillon Sir be so good as not to go away without giving me an opportunity to tell you something I can not say before the queen	43.854227530455
Chatillon bowed in token of assent and they all went out stopping at the window of a gallery on the ground floor	50.26287079461667
Sir said Aramis you allowed yourself just now to treat us in a most extraordinary manner	98.95243280497256
That would not be endurable in any case and is still less so on the part of those who came to bring the queen the message of a liar	84.0649632749488
What have you done with Monsieur de Bruy Has he by any possibility gone to change his face which was too like that of Monsieur de Mazarin There is an abundance of Italian masks at the Palais Royal from harlequin even to pantaloon	246.80469088360041
Leave me alone said Aramis impatiently	1086.3468042063682
You know well that I do nt like to leave things half finished	437.92912780232064
Conclude then sir answered De Chatillon with as much hauteur as Aramis	296.42482534262024
Gentlemen resumed Aramis any one but the Comte de la Fere and myself would have had you arrestedfor we have friends in Parisbut we are contented with another course	148.79308395435598
Come and converse with us for just five minutes sword in hand upon this deserted terrace	699.6966999181188
I know well that the proposition is tempting but at present it is impossible to accept it	109.02907373404256
And why not said Aramis in his tone of raillery	107.50077474848459
Is it Mazarins proximity that makes you so prudent	209.62583810963264
Oh you hear that Flamarens said Chatillon	662.5634983046729
Not to reply would be a blot on my name and my honor	100.36236768145199
That is my opinion said Aramis	2697.9193121017975
You will not reply however and these gentlemen I am sure will presently be of my opinion	118.93644425228855
Aramis shook his head with a motion of indescribable insolence	250.98902116767357
Chatillon saw the motion and put his hand to his sword	16.987078938110624
Duke said Flamarens you forget that tomorrow you are to command an expedition of the greatest importance projected by the prince assented to by the queen	147.7314783670819
Until tomorrow evening you are not at your own disposal	48.994609476340095
Let it be then the day after tomorrow said Aramis	115.43047313990336
Tomorrow rather said De Chatillon if you will take the trouble of coming so far as the gates of Charenton	60.144295718312705
How can you doubt it sir For the pleasure of a meeting with you I would go to the end of the world	43.08785397210018
Are you going to rejoin your cardinal Swear first on your honor not to inform him of our return	186.60083165443456
Because it is for victors to make conditions and you are not yet victors gentlemen	173.77008637016496
Then let us draw on the spot	48.35421766781704
It is all one to usto us who do not command tomorrows expedition	891.9870634169695
Chatillon and Flamarens looked at each other	6.274171300103203
There was such irony in the words and in the bearing of Aramis that the duke had great difficulty in bridling his anger but at a word from Flamarens he restrained himself and contented himself with saying	159.97206879804583
You promise sirthats agreedthat I shall find you tomorrow at Charenton	159.00849789742819
Oh do nt be afraid sir replied Aramis and the two gentlemen shortly afterward left the Louvre	318.5051851182161
For what reason is all this fume and fury asked Athos	1813.9258821211256
What have they done to you	28.942045810604533
Theydid you not see what they did	64.44433085027502
They laughed when we swore that we had done our duty in England	77.68398728434951
Now if they believed us they laughed in order to insult us if they did not believe it they insulted us all the more	118.91441006098889
However I m glad not to fight them until tomorrow	68.17420769767568
I hope we shall have something better to do tonight than to draw the sword	106.29303188909952
Athos curled his lip with disdain	1151.6952307728714
These undertakings do not suit me as you know Aramis	101.79692316825658
Because it is taking people unawares	200786.06556102633
Really Athos you would make a singular general	209.0959725671923
You would fight only by broad daylight warn your foe before an attack and never attempt anything by night lest you should be accused of taking advantage of the darkness	372.2708097029727
You know one can not change his nature he said	121.47880050552162
Besides do you know what is our situation and whether Mazarins arrest would nt be rather an encumbrance than an advantage	344.7078992015925
Say at once you disapprove of my proposal	70.28221523901509
I think you ought to do nothing since you exacted a promise from these gentlemen not to let Mazarin know that we were in France	142.57530561211348
I have entered into no engagement and consider myself quite free	387.418397733391
Either to seek the Duc de Beaufort or the Duc de Bouillon and to tell them about this	33.88771109550615
Yes but on one conditionthat we begin by the coadjutor	238.91199139356758
He is a priest learned in cases of conscience and we will tell him ours	102.58400260163602
It was then agreed that they were to go first to Monsieur de Bouillon as his house came first but first of all Athos begged that he might go to the Hotel du Grand Charlemagne to see Raoul	194.6141472696254
They reentered the boat which had brought them to the Louvre and thence proceeded to the Halles and taking up Grimaud and Blaisois they went on foot to the Rue Guenegaud	95.72781359230437
But Raoul was not at the Hotel du Grand Charlemagne	281.68040973664523
He had received a message from the prince to whom he had hastened with Olivain the instant he had received it	70.76795909444365
The three Lieutenants of the Generalissimo	46628.51650277959
The night was dark but still the town resounded with those noises that disclose a city in a state of siege	324.1080322902209
Athos and Aramis did not proceed a hundred steps without being stopped by sentinels placed before the barricades who demanded the watchword and on their saying that they were going to Monsieur de Bouillon on a mission of importance a guide was given them under pretext of conducting them but in fact as a spy over their movements	216.64635345456503
On arriving at the Hotel de Bouillon they came across a little troop of three cavaliers who seemed to know every possible password for they walked without either guide or escort and on arriving at the barricades had nothing to do but to speak to those who guarded them who instantly let them pass with evident deference due probably to their high birth	257.57082897539874
On seeing them Athos and Aramis stood still	189.7803916485702
Oh cried Aramis do you see count	143.9695058118733
Who do these three cavaliers appear to you to be	55.83560452482238
You are not mistaken I recognize Monsieur de Flamarens	370.31817908960187
As to the cavalier in the brown cloak	196.04208830069044
How the devil do they venture so near the Hotel de Bouillon	151.6489385057514
Athos smiled but did not reply	76.99955103053816
Five minutes afterward they knocked at the princes door	63.95222327748325
This door was guarded by a sentinel and there was also a guard placed in the courtyard ready to obey the orders of the Prince de Contis lieutenant	94.97495593612139
Monsieur de Bouillon had the gout but notwithstanding his illness which had prevented his mounting on horseback for the last monththat is since Paris had been besiegedhe was ready to receive the Comte de la Fere and the Chevalier dHerblay	125.43912330149266
He was in bed but surrounded with all the paraphernalia of war	143.52181212382536
Everywhere were swords pistols cuirasses and arquebuses and it was plain that as soon as his gout was better Monsieur de Bouillon would give a pretty tangle to the enemies of the parliament to unravel	200.68463599893994
Meanwhile to his great regret as he said he was obliged to keep his bed	47.73209624976349
Ah gentlemen he cried as the two friends entered you are very happy you can ride you can go and come and fight for the cause of the people	75.45961303208556
But I as you see am nailed to my bedah this demon goutthis demon gout	6870.776233555216
My lord said Athos we are just arrived from England and our first concern is to inquire after your health	141.9784633337847
Thanks gentlemen thanks As you see my health is but indifferent	174.44537170174115
And King Charles is well as I have just heard	21.59581533239525
He is dead my lord said Aramis	202.9189314239813
Pooh said the duke too much astonished to believe it true	68.10605058103599
Dead on the scaffold condemned by parliament	531.0840762272553
What then has Monsieur de Flamarens been telling me	697.7862585847031
Yes he has just gone out	14.606192733347925
With two companions yes replied the duke	87.57603238518121
Then he added with a certain uneasiness Did you meet them	246.40191365330315
Why yes I think soin the street said Athos and he looked smilingly at Aramis who looked at him with an expression of surprise	59.28993569815044
The devil take this gout cried Monsieur de Bouillon evidently ill at ease	424.47914285731963
My lord said Athos we admire your devotion to the cause you have espoused in remaining at the head of the army whilst so ill in so much pain	153.61773403052302
One must replied Monsieur de Bouillon sacrifice ones comfort to the public good but I confess to you I am now almost exhausted	372.86702162115
My spirit is willing my head is clear but this demon the gout oercrows me	843.496772828973
I confess if the court would do justice to my claims and give the head of my house the title of prince and if my brother De Turenne were reinstated in his command I would return to my estates and leave the court and parliament to settle things between themselves as they might	155.71075756244045
You are perfectly right my lord	29.933035482874065
You think so At this very moment the court is making overtures to me hitherto I have repulsed them but since such men as you assure me that I am wrong in doing so I ve a good mind to follow your advice and to accept a proposition made to me by the Duc de Chatillon just now	87.45588197397888
Accept it my lord accept it said Aramis	171.39844161483992
I am even sorry that this evening I almost repulsedbut there will be a conference tomorrow and we shall see	157.4379003611415
The two friends saluted the duke	1456.5645411434557
Go gentlemen he said you must be much fatigued after your voyage	351.8741152016871
Poor King Charles But after all he was somewhat to blame in all that business and we may console ourselves with the reflection that France has no cause of reproach in the matter and did all she could to serve him	107.35600781806875
Oh as to that said Aramis we are witnesses	500.88037710670784
Yes do you know I am very glad to hear you give that testimony the cardinal has some good in him and if he were not a foreignerwell he would be more justly estimated	174.2481924070571
Oh the devil take this gout	80357.67280471066
Athos and Aramis took their leave but even in the antechamber they could still hear the dukes cries he was evidently suffering the tortures of the damned	162.01870734209717
When they reached the street Aramis said	907.3703488913858
Well Athos what do you think	11.876392798980595
My friend I think that he is much troubled with gout	672.2369606187882
You noticed that I did nt breathe a word as to the purpose of our visit	65.11665241269564
You did well you would have caused him an access of his disease	88.36919330987301
Let us go to Monsieur de Beaufort	42.45336721006198
The two friends went to the Hotel de Vendome	90.43868104213782
It was ten oclock when they arrived	26.740539163002047
The Hotel de Vendome was not less guarded than the Hotel de Bouillon and presented as warlike an appearance	241.29893108488636
There were sentinels a guard in the court stacks of arms and horses saddled	303.0254759990843
Two horsemen going out as Athos and Aramis entered were obliged to give place to them	146.71721754038776
Ah ah gentlemen said Aramis decidedly it is a night for meetings	330.6223386852087
We shall be very unfortunate if after meeting so often this evening we should not succeed in meeting tomorrow	144.1178269546603
Oh as to that sir replied Chatillon for it was he who with Flamarens was leaving the Duc de Beaufort you may be assured for if we meet by night without seeking each other much more shall we meet by day when wishing it	162.38180593212815
I hope that is true said Aramis	151.17337726896972
As for me I am sure of it said the duke	22.945227138241798
De Flamarens and De Chatillon continued on their way and Athos and Aramis dismounted	172.79751880363816
Hardly had they given the bridles of their horses to their lackeys and rid themselves of their cloaks when a man approached them and after looking at them for an instant by the doubtful light of the lantern hung in the centre of the courtyard he uttered an exclamation of joy and ran to embrace them	90.63747599817391
Comte de la Fere the man cried out Chevalier dHerblay How does it happen that you are in Paris	306.8743151605941
Yes we arrived four or five days ago from the Vendomois as you know and we are going to give Mazarin something to do	57.33605187675648
You are still with us I presume	103.97982271292439
You know his successour dear duke He is really king of Paris he ca nt go out without being mobbed by his admirers	137.61278416930995
Ah so much the better Can we have the honor of seeing his highness	81.72763159092558
I shall be proud to present you and Rochefort walked on	406.4434233463819
Every door was opened to him	19.809652882630353
Monsieur de Beaufort was at supper but he rose quickly on hearing the two friends announced	149.64923410347885
Ah he cried by Jove you re welcome sirs	1633.2043406899418
You are coming to sup with me are you not Boisgoli tell Noirmont that I have two guests	160.43989433642687
You know Noirmont do you not The successor of Father Marteau who makes the excellent pies you know of	278.98206821089536
Boisgoli let him send one of his best but not such a one as he made for La Ramee	134.24568349173032
Thank God we do nt want either rope ladders or gagpears now	2604.8758685941307
My lord said Athos do not let us disturb you	19.39037116835887
We came merely to inquire after your health and to take your orders	78.08408105828836
As to my health since it has stood five years of prison with Monsieur de Chavigny to boot tis excellent As to my orders since every one gives his own commands in our party I shall end if this goes on by giving none at all	312.58898051581167
In short my lord said Athos glancing at Aramis your highness is discontented with your party	775.950857910622
Discontented sir say my highness is furious To such a degree I assure you though I would not say so to others that if the queen acknowledging the injuries she has done me would recall my mother and give me the reversion of the admiralty which belonged to my father and was promised me at his death well it would not be long before I should be training dogs to say that there were greater traitors in France than the Cardinal Mazarin	128.45997505762944
At this Athos and Aramis could not help exchanging not only a look but a smile and had they not known it for a fact this would have told them that De Chatillon and De Flamarens had been there	157.01418509695742
My lord said Athos we are satisfied we came here only to express our loyalty and to say that we are at your lordships service and his most faithful servants	133.02414498688094
My most faithful friends gentlemen my most faithful friends you have proved it	113.39386243207161
And if ever I am reconciled with the court I shall prove to you I hope that I remain your friend as well as that ofwhat the devil are their namesDArtagnan and Porthos	154.1266306609613
You understand then Comte de la Fere you understand Chevalier dHerblay that I am altogether and always at your service	112.38409561972753
Athos and Aramis bowed and went out	14.93384286433826
My dear Athos cried Aramis I think you consented to accompany me only to give me a lessonGod forgive me	80.070776594213
Wait a little Aramis it will be time for you to perceive my motive when we have paid our visit to the coadjutor	77.03177576865215
Let us then go to the archiepiscopal palace said Aramis	413.18463386144043
They directed their horses to the city	66.96237855576807
On arriving at the cradle from which Paris sprang they found it inundated with water and it was again necessary to take a boat	191.5543709146436
The palace rose from the bosom of the water and to see the number of boats around it one would have fancied ones self not in Paris but in Venice	131.54779109618076
Some of these boats were dark and mysterious others noisy and lighted up with torches	232.1340045540918
The friends slid in through this congestion of embarkation and landed in their turn	251.92118305274468
The palace was surrounded with water but a kind of staircase had been fixed to the lower walls and the only difference was that instead of entering by the doors people entered by the windows	108.44023128175357
Thus did Athos and Aramis make their appearance in the antechamber where about a dozen noblemen were collected in waiting	235.70952372962654
Good heavens said Aramis to Athos does the coadjutor intend to indulge himself in the pleasure of making us cool our hearts off in his antechamber	207.5846164883867
My dear friend we must take people as we find them	175.70743340905065
The coadjutor is at this moment one of the seven kings of Paris and has a court	64.40131981624397
Let us send in our names and if he does not send us a suitable message we will leave him to his own affairs or those of France	52.317371922064346
Let us call one of these lackeys with a demipistole in the left hand	170.7745584596056
Ah if I m not mistaken heres Bazin	11960.865557503812
Bazin who was crossing the antechamber majestically in his clerical dress turned around to see who the impertinent gentleman was who thus addressed him but seeing his friends he went up to them quickly and expressed delight at seeing them	192.03408233890568
A truce to compliments said Aramis we want to see the coadjutor and instantly as we are in haste	121.19072729682125
Certainly sirit is not such lords as you are who are allowed to wait in the antechamber only just now he has a secret conference with Monsieur de Bruy	135.9106147348541
De Bruy cried the friends tis then useless our seeing monsieur the coadjutor this evening said Aramis so we give it up	338.0277568772387
And they hastened to quit the palace followed by Bazin who was lavish of bows and compliments	296.5203862623051
Well said Athos when Aramis and he were in the boat again are you beginning to be convinced that we should have done a bad turn to all these people in arresting Mazarin	122.26030357336775
You are wisdom incarnate Athos Aramis replied	2742.468150564341
What had especially been observed by the two friends was the little interest taken by the court of France in the terrible events which had occurred in England which they thought should have arrested the attention of all Europe	74.6197705511858
In fact aside from a poor widow and a royal orphan who wept in the corner of the Louvre no one appeared to be aware that Charles I	118.48158172480075
had ever lived and that he had perished on the scaffold	66.72626457794422
The two friends made an appointment for ten oclock on the following day for though the night was well advanced when they reached the door of the hotel Aramis said that he had certain important visits to make and left Athos to enter alone	88.35530696828208
At ten oclock the next day they met again	61.38296208044286
Athos had been out since six oclock	55.39447588777988
Well have you any news Athos asked	1766.412668492844
No one has seen DArtagnan and Porthos has not appeared	128.3824138637643
In fact said Athos this delay is not natural they took the shortest route and should have arrived before we did	230.776536002572
Add to that DArtagnans rapidity in action and that he is not the man to lose an hour knowing that we were expecting him	86.05250792012089
He expected you will remember to be here on the fifth	32.36256978689632
And here we are at the ninth	575.3568645768136
This evening the margin of possible delay expires	15365.717454965492
What do you think should be done asked Athos if we have no news of them tonight	71.39178694798079
Pardieu we must go and look for them	213.78534106257155
A light cloud passed over the counts face	36.486806507205415
Raoul gives me much uneasiness he said	20.569844051585417
He received yesterday a message from the Prince de Cond he went to meet him at Saint Cloud and has not returned	68.83539903508387
Have you seen Madame de Chevreuse	2371.1493751588514
And you Aramis you were going I think to visit Madame de Longueville	109.48548078140917
She was no longer there but she had left her new address	183.2490116435822
Guess I give you a thousand chances	2458.3970352299293
How should I know where the most beautiful and active of the Frondists was at midnight for I presume it was when you left me that you went to visit her	80.36672180525967
At the Hotel de Ville my dear fellow	140.42257827646236
What at the Hotel de Ville Has she then been appointed provost of merchants	699.165706502837
No but she has become queen of Paris ad interim and since she could not venture at once to establish herself in the Palais Royal or the Tuileries she is installed at the Hotel de Ville where she is on the point of giving an heir or an heiress to that dear duke	116.18179260754712
You did nt tell me of that Aramis	454.29849790921423
Really It was my forgetfulness then pardon me	71.1198405049622
Now asked Athos what are we to do with ourselves till evening Here we are without occupation it seems to me	192.68839190175586
You forget my friend that we have work cut out for us in the direction of Charenton I hope to see Monsieur de Chatillon whom I ve hated for a long time there	133.61254165694947
Because he is the brother of Coligny	732.4658013339404
Ah true he who presumed to be a rival of yours for which he was severely punished that ought to satisfy you	127.79223495003224
Yes but it does not I am rancorousthe only stigma that proves me to be a churchman	392.34779816698585
Do you understand You understand that you are in no way obliged to go with me	40.19169615453221
Come now said Athos you are joking	276.443290164746
In that case my dear friend if you are resolved to accompany me there is no time to lose the drum beats I observed cannon on the road I saw the citizens in order of battle on the Place of the Hotel de Ville certainly the fight will be in the direction of Charenton as the Duc de Chatillon said	91.54557201561359
I supposed said Athos that last nights conferences would modify those warlike arrangements	3908.136374955474
No doubt but they will fight none the less if only to mask the conferences	490.9851517720266
Poor creatures said Athos who are going to be killed in order that Monsieur de Bouillon may have his estate at Sedan restored to him that the reversion of the admiralty may be given to the Duc de Beaufort and that the coadjutor may be made a cardinal	92.88620260618278
Come come dear Athos confess that you would not be so philosophical if your Raoul were to be involved in this affair	83.86277114932557
Perhaps you speak the truth Aramis	168734.42599688287
Well let us go then where the fighting is for that is the most likely place to meet with DArtagnan Porthos and possibly even Raoul	264.50011372011596
Stop there are a fine body of citizens passing quite attractive by Jupiter and their captainsee he has the true military style	1051.362001578747
Lieutenant yesterday said Aramis captain today colonel doubtless tomorrow in a fortnight the fellow will be marshal of France	340.15946162114443
Question him about the fight said Athos	438.6158118696624
Planchet prouder than ever of his new duties deigned to explain to the two gentlemen that he was ordered to take up his position on the Place Royale with two hundred men forming the rear of the army of Paris and to march on Charenton when necessary	136.8863186716186
This day will be a warm one said Planchet in a warlike tone	129.62567518990224
No doubt said Aramis but it is far from here to the enemy	44.7554134184194
Sir the distance will be diminished said a subordinate	3455.9009641958087
Aramis saluted then turning toward Athos	13777.422963666302
I do nt care to camp on the Place Royale with all these people he said	102.40365474715969
Shall we go forward We shall see better what is going on	28.40195145588906
And then Monsieur de Chatillon will not come to the Place Royale to look for you	61.290792617069144
Come then my friend we will go forward	65.16628728373288
Have nt you something to say to Monsieur de Flamarens on your own account	88.51379740194913
My friend said Athos I have made a resolution never to draw my sword save when it is absolutely necessary	102.68373087731693
And how long ago was that	43.68452803830186
When I last drew my poniard	10723.719642510367
Ah Good another souvenir of Monsieur Mordaunt	4016.4497266912754
Well my friend nothing now is lacking except that you should feel remorse for having killed that fellow	462.186522717536
Hush said Athos putting a finger on his lips with the sad smile peculiar to him let us talk no more of Mordauntit will bring bad luck	72.88855769687827
And Athos set forward toward Charenton followed closely by Aramis	3333.5187115308154
As Athos and Aramis proceeded and passed different companies on the road they became aware that they were arriving near the field of battle	175.1081522465628
Ah my friend cried Athos suddenly where have you brought us I fancy I perceive around us faces of different officers in the royal army is not that the Duc de Chatillon himself coming toward us with his brigadiers	260.1552206544832
Goodday sirs said the duke advancing you are puzzled by what you see here but one word will explain everything	125.19090269444683
There is now a truce and a conference	120.24856239461157
The prince Monsieur de Retz the Duc de Beaufort the Duc de Bouillon are talking over public affairs	122.2059300394377
Now one of two things must happen either matters will not be arranged or they will be arranged in which last case I shall be relieved of my command and we shall still meet again	99.14885355847025
Sir said Aramis you speak to the point	34.17867344521672
Allow me to ask you a question Where are the plenipotentiaries	568.0780667472918
At Charenton in the second house on the right on entering from the direction of Paris	56.58530663599474
And was this conference arranged beforehand	20997.625732642064
No gentlemen it seems to be the result of certain propositions which Mazarin made last night to the Parisians	244.47349570943015
Athos and Aramis exchanged smiles for they well knew what those propositions were to whom they had been made and who had made them	87.23336775122831
And that house in which the plenipotentiaries are asked Athos belongs to	638.7287961058723
To Monsieur de Chanleu who commands your troops at Charenton	911.2571715912005
I say your troops for I presume that you gentlemen are Frondeurs	264.03730605190134
We are for the king and the princes added Athos	628.5784529568772
We must understand each other said the duke	42.548216070159285
The king is with us and his generals are the Duke of Orleans and the Prince de Cond although I must add tis almost impossible now to know to which party any one belongs	289.62059202130007
Yes answered Athos but his right place is in our ranks with the Prince de Conti De Beaufort DElbeuf and De Bouillon but sir supposing that the conference is broken offare you going to try to take Charenton	337.4592909030873
Sir since you command the cavalry	43304.963140397886
You must know all your officersI mean those more distinguished	1541.9584100185023
Will you then kindly tell me if you have in your command the Chevalier dArtagnan lieutenant in the musketeers	129.75453704366134
No sir he is not with us he left Paris more than six weeks ago and is believed to have gone on a mission to England	97.59952499295005
I knew that but I supposed he had returned	623.1022074471826
No sir no one has seen him	33.55097533829303
I can answer positively on that point for the musketeers belong to our forces and Monsieur de Cambon the substitute for Monsieur dArtagnan still holds his place	354.1028069031424
The two friends looked at each other	4.917862894206586
It is absolutely certain that some misfortune has happened to them on the way	51.0579406894073
If we have no news of them this evening tomorrow we must start	69.58366069653304
And Monsieur de Bragelonne a young man fifteen years of age attached to the Prince de Condhas he the honor of being known to you diffident in allowing the sarcastic Aramis to perceive how strong were his paternal feelings	290.5244118019501
Yes surely he came with the prince a charming young man he is one of your friends then monsieur le comte	89.5045716323335
Yes sir answered Athos agitated so much so that I wish to see him if possible	55.872306764579285
Quite possible sir do me the favor to accompany me and I will conduct you to headquarters	63.00772167544719
Halloo there cried Aramis turning around what a noise behind us	165.22746333787507
A body of cavaliers is coming toward us said Chatillon	386.4816607456123
I recognize the coadjutor by his Frondist hat	1078.4141730713666
And I the Duc de Beaufort by his white plume of ostrich feathers	405.99177634975365
They are coming full gallop the prince is with themah he is leaving them	325.60835298051836
They are beating the rappel cried Chatillon we must discover what is going on	168.01577087415168
In fact they saw the soldiers running to their arms the trumpets sounded the drums beat the Duc de Beaufort drew his sword	277.7957690936443
On his side the prince sounded a rappel and all the officers of the royalist army mingling momentarily with the Parisian troops ran to him	208.54366794291445
Gentlemen cried Chatillon the truce is broken that is evident they are going to fight go then into Charenton for I shall begin in a short timetheres a signal from the prince	201.96078188965419
The cornet of a troop had in fact just raised the standard of the prince	125.45762712318016
Farewell till the next time we meet cried Chatillon and he set off full gallop	174.15992788242153
Athos and Aramis turned also and went to salute the coadjutor and the Duc de Beaufort	66.12308087995495
As to the Duc de Bouillon he had such a fit of gout as obliged him to return to Paris in a litter but his place was well filled by the Duc dElbeuf and his four sons ranged around him like a staff	147.0282831292193
Meantime between Charenton and the royal army was left a space which looked ready to serve as a last resting place for the dead	229.32320649716547
Gentlemen cried the coadjutor tightening his sash which he wore after the fashion of the ancient military prelates over his archiepiscopal simar there s the enemy approaching	327.90207889711417
Let us save them half of their journey	57.970626578681774
And without caring whether he were followed or not he set off his regiment which bore the name of the regiment of Corinth from the name of his archbishopric darted after him and began the fight	141.6165691672744
Monsieur de Beaufort sent his cavalry toward Etampes and Monsieur de Chanleu who defended the place was ready to resist an assault or if the enemy were repulsed to attempt a sortie	381.0028739644393
The battle soon became general and the coadjutor performed miracles of valor	1075.4568944805471
His proper vocation had always been the sword and he was delighted whenever he could draw it from the scabbard no matter for whom or against whom	161.50952549017794
Chanleu whose fire at one time repulsed the royal regiment thought that the moment was come to pursue it but it was reformed and led again to the charge by the Duc de Chatillon in person	142.46591107228642
This charge was so fierce so skillfully conducted that Chanleu was almost surrounded	1365.8497518302854
He commanded a retreat which began step by step foot by foot unhappily in an instant he fell mortally wounded	336.2104573469441
De Chatillon saw him fall and announced it in a loud voice to his men which raised their spirits and completely disheartened their enemies so that every man thought only of his own safety and tried to gain the trenches where the coadjutor was trying to reform his disorganized regiment	171.05788426946287
Suddenly a squadron of cavalry galloped up to encounter the royal troops who were entering pelemele the intrenchments with the fugitives	601.8344366681425
Athos and Aramis charged at the head of their squadrons Aramis with sword and pistol in his hands Athos with his sword in his scabbard his pistol in his saddlebags calm and cool as if on the parade except that his noble and beautiful countenance became sad as he saw slaughtered so many men who were sacrificed on the one side to the obstinacy of royalty and on the other to the personal rancor of the princes	131.52225226043905
Aramis on the contrary struck right and left and was almost delirious with excitement	361.5519390948077
His bright eyes kindled and his mouth so finely formed assumed a wicked smile every blow he aimed was sure and his pistol finished the deedannihilated the wounded wretch who tried to rise again	372.4886816899695
On the opposite side two cavaliers one covered with a gilt cuirass the other wearing simply a buff doublet from which fell the sleeves of a vest of blue velvet charged in front	243.54644141173077
The cavalier in the gilt cuirass fell upon Aramis and struck a blow that Aramis parried with his wonted skill	607.2936005721061
Ah tis you Monsieur de Chatillon cried the chevalier welcome to youI expected you	377.4759306132733
I hope I have not made you wait too long sir said the duke at all events here I am	76.94873446821231
Monsieur de Chatillon cried Aramis taking from his saddlebags a second pistol I think if your pistols have been discharged you are a dead man	107.26521119539714
Thank God sir they are not	18.122747570868995
And the duke pointing his pistol at Aramis fired	2553.2022164362993
But Aramis bent his head the instant he saw the dukes finger press the trigger and the ball passed without touching him	219.44371402703334
Oh you ve missed me cried Aramis but I swear to Heaven I will not miss you	119.63330453592306
If I give you time cried the duke spurring on his horse and rushing upon him with his drawn sword	164.83586502545978
Aramis awaited him with that terrible smile which was peculiar to him on such occasions and Athos who saw the duke advancing toward Aramis with the rapidity of lightning was just going to cry out Fire fire then when the shot was fired	100.11042732089909
De Chatillon opened his arms and fell back on the crupper of his horse	27.899035406289148
The ball had entered his breast through a notch in the cuirass	307.778468789477
I am a dead man he said and fell from his horse to the ground	24.04913856387885
I told you this I am now grieved I have kept my word	96.55076436471695
Can I be of any use to you	32.270913503805815
Chatillon made a sign with his hand and Aramis was about to dismount when he received a violent shock twas a thrust from a sword but his cuirass turned aside the blow	175.56063024398844
He turned around and seized his new antagonist by the wrist when he started back exclaiming Raoul	401.42491663624986
The young man recognized at the same instant the voices of his father and the Chevalier dHerblay two officers in the Parisian forces rushed at that instant on Raoul but Aramis protected him with his sword	175.14617930145332
Athos took his sons horse by the bridle and led him forth out of the melee	66.28312573112234
At this crisis of the battle the prince who had been seconding De Chatillon in the second line appeared in the midst of the fight his eagle eye made him known and his blows proclaimed the hero	247.55968808013643
On seeing him the regiment of Corinth which the coadjutor had not been able to reorganize in spite of all his efforts threw itself into the midst of the Parisian forces put them into confusion and reentered Charenton flying	164.88856558919397
The coadjutor dragged along with his fugitive forces passed near the group formed by Athos Raoul and Aramis	630.5900223427477
Aramis could not in his jealousy avoid being pleased at the coadjutors misfortune and was about to utter some bon mot more witty than correct when Athos stopped him	637.7842413911665
On on he cried this is no moment for compliments or rather back for the battle seems to be lost by the Frondeurs	122.68898064857036
It is a matter of indifference to me said Aramis I came here only to meet De Chatillon I have met him I am contented tis something to have met De Chatillon in a duel	152.0880461941402
And besides we have a prisoner said Athos pointing to Raoul	477.5668414598271
The three cavaliers continued their road on full gallop	174.0466029283644
What were you doing in the battle my friend inquired Athos of the youth twas not your right place I think as you were not equipped for an engagement	208.05839934384957
I had no intention of fighting today sir I was charged indeed with a mission to the cardinal and had set out for Rueil when seeing Monsieur de Chatillon charge an invincible desire possessed me to charge at his side	349.2391606045007
It was then that he told me two cavaliers of the Parisian army were seeking me and named the Comte de la Fere	93.14488965727661
What you knew we were there and yet wished to kill your friend the chevalier	167.44944362365138
I did not recognize the chevalier in armor sir said Raoul blushing though I might have known him by his skill and coolness in danger	286.9951711749832
Thank you for the compliment my young friend replied Aramis we can see from whom you learned courtesy	269.27340088272547
Then you were going to Rueil	35934.81561443652
Yes I have a despatch from the prince to his eminence	67.57055938676136
You must still deliver it said Athos	276.7067229220299
No false generosity count the fate of our friends to say nothing of our own is perhaps in that very despatch	116.98502866258374
This young man must not however fail in his duty said Athos	467.60854750944566
In the first place count this youth is our prisoner you seem to forget that	183.50891407689812
What I propose to do is fair in war the vanquished must not be dainty in the choice of means	271.33808465324796
The young man hesitated and looked at Athos as if seeking to read in his eyes a rule of conduct	113.15893500279157
Give him the despatch Raoul you are the chevaliers prisoner	486.712902681989
Raoul gave it up reluctantly Aramis instantly seized and read it	473.21214261092746
You he said you who are so trusting read and reflect that there is something in this letter important for us to see	145.66125250130867
Athos took the letter frowning but an idea that he should find something in this letter about DArtagnan conquered his unwillingness to read it	158.3599552812468
My lord I shall send this evening to your eminence in order to reinforce the troop of Monsieur de Comminges the ten men you demand	159.85019848034338
They are good soldiers fit to confront the two violent adversaries whose address and resolution your eminence is fearful of	239.66094002783663
Well said Aramis what think you about these two enemies whom it requires besides Commingess troop ten good soldiers to confront are they not as like as two drops of water to DArtagnan and Porthos	509.93740413341726
Well search Paris all day long said Athos and if we have no news this evening we will return to the road to Picardy and I feel no doubt that thanks to DArtagnans ready invention we shall then find some clew which will solve our doubts	136.2991994264244
Yes let us search Paris and especially inquire of Planchet if he has yet heard from his former master	252.03205313779154
That poor Planchet You speak of him very much at your ease Aramis he has probably been killed	119.73587104038904
All those fighting citizens went out to battle and they have been massacred	260.41205861413675
It was then with a sentiment of uneasiness whether Planchet who alone could give them information was alive or dead that the friends returned to the Place Royale to their great surprise they found the citizens still encamped there drinking and bantering each other although doubtless mourned by their families who thought they were at Charenton in the thickest of the fighting	269.44925472910256
Athos and Aramis again questioned Planchet but he had seen nothing of DArtagnan they wished to take Planchet with them but he could not leave his troop who at five oclock returned home saying that they were returning from the battle whereas they had never lost sight of the bronze equestrian statue of Louis XIII	125.55096043156651
On leaving Paris Athos and Aramis well knew that they would be encountering great danger but we know that for men like these there could be no question of danger	157.14456093726594
Besides they felt that the dnouement of this second Odyssey was at hand and that there remained but a single effort to make	155.59952825707066
Besides there was no tranquillity in Paris itself	157.28493870116327
Provisions began to fail and whenever one of the Prince de Contis generals wished to gain more influence he got up a little popular tumult which he put down again and thus for the moment gained a superiority over his colleagues	179.16657391420947
In one of these risings the Duc de Beaufort pillaged the house and library of Mazarin in order to give the populace as he put it something to gnaw at	185.9244620205579
Athos and Aramis left Paris after this coupdetat which took place on the very evening of the day in which the Parisians had been beaten at Charenton	81.43479478332364
They quitted Paris beholding it abandoned to extreme want bordering on famine agitated by fear torn by faction	3656.068507921525
Parisians and Frondeurs as they were the two friends expected to find the same misery the same fears the same intrigue in the enemys camp but what was their surprise after passing Saint Denis to hear that at Saint Germain people were singing and laughing and leading generally cheerful lives	356.29676145611523
The two gentlemen traveled by byways in order not to encounter the Mazarinists scattered about the Isle of France and also to escape the Frondeurs who were in possession of Normandy and who never failed to conduct captives to the Duc de Longueville in order that he might ascertain whether they were friends or foes	177.55854803093115
Having escaped these dangers they returned by the main road to Boulogne at Abbeville and followed it step by step examining every track	312.0765186099466
Nevertheless they were still in a state of uncertainty	168.32353489915866
Several inns were visited by them several innkeepers questioned without a single clew being given to guide their inquiries when at Montreuil Athos felt upon the table that something rough was touching his delicate fingers	830.9148091173095
He turned up the cloth and found these hieroglyphics carved upon the wood with a knife	217.52691804686805
This is capital said Athos to Aramis we were to have slept here but we cannotwe must push on	339.14841498719653
They rode forward and reached Abbeville	645283.6205730379
There the great number of inns puzzled them they could not go to all how could they guess in which those whom they were seeking had stayed	326.08043758723636
Trust me said Aramis do not expect to find anything in Abbeville	116.52646820885406
If we had only been looking for Porthos Porthos would have stationed himself in one of the finest hotels and we could easily have traced him	235.3132676005669
But DArtagnan is devoid of such weaknesses	1955.621016634556
Porthos would have found it very difficult even to make him see that he was dying of hunger he has gone on his road as inexorable as fate and we must seek him somewhere else	98.64775825445189
It had now become a weary and almost hopeless task and had it not been for the threefold motives of honor friendship and gratitude implanted in their hearts our two travelers would have given up many a time their rides over the sand their interrogatories of the peasantry and their close inspection of faces	442.00227047572946
His noble nature felt that their ignorance was a sort of reflection upon them	115.12936804673468
They had not looked carefully enough for their lost friends	381.48578213039855
They had not shown sufficient pertinacity in their inquiries	1689.298320526074
They were willing and ready to retrace their steps when in crossing the suburb which leads to the gates of the town upon a white wall which was at the corner of a street turning around the rampart Athos cast his eyes upon a drawing in black chalk which represented with the awkwardness of a first attempt two cavaliers riding furiously one of them carried a roll of paper on which were written these words They are following us	152.84383712376032
Oh exclaimed Athos here it is as clear as day pursued as he was DArtagnan would not have tarried here five minutes had he been pressed very closely which gives us hopes that he may have succeeded in escaping	173.67082130002007
Had he escaped we should either have seen him or have heard him spoken of	108.4596114647292
You are right Aramis let us travel on	45.669747900549076
To describe the impatience and anxiety of these two friends would be impossible	88.45985496580816
Uneasiness took possession of the tender constant heart of Athos and fearful forecasts were the torment of the impulsive Aramis	837.507686109587
They galloped on for two or three hours as furiously as the cavaliers on the wall	61.95013419197215
All at once in a narrow pass they perceived that the road was partially barricaded by an enormous stone	331.6246023413527
It had evidently been rolled across the pass by some arm of giant strength	326.73985313438135
Oh he said looking at the stone this is the work of either Hercules or Porthos	242.48909885737677
Let us get down count and examine this rock	216.6825817083046
The stone had been brought with the evident intention of barricading the road but some one having perceived the obstacle had partially turned it aside	366.16469449371846
With the assistance of Blaisois and Grimaud the friends succeeded in turning the stone over	403.88214633083044
Upon the side next the ground were scratched the following words	648.1944908034106
Eight of the light dragoons are pursuing us	433.9164377253386
If we reach Compiegne we shall stop at the Peacock	91.04369618193182
It is kept by a friend of ours	70.77762095834119
At last we have something definite said Athos let us go to the Peacock	191.86151824213812
Yes answered Aramis but if we are to get there we must rest our horses for they are almost brokenwinded	124.8059066107223
Aramis was right they stopped at the first tavern and made each horse swallow a double quantity of corn steeped in wine they gave them three hours rest and then set off again	225.47671561352564
The men themselves were almost dead with fatigue but hope supported them	291.5926075000872
In six hours they reached Compiegne and alighted at the Peacock	395.85338587878766
The host proved to be a worthy man as bald as a Chinaman	203.35643081476843
They asked him if some time ago he had not received in his house two gentlemen who were pursued by dragoons without answering he went out and brought in the blade of a rapier	111.05850690997899
Do you know that he asked	15.925755798672494
Does it belong to the smaller or to the larger of the two asked the host	302.3280791007589
I see that you are the friends of these gentlemen	53.69909244991183
Well what has happened to them	122.15039468754982
They were pursued by eight of the light dragoons who rode into the courtyard before they had time to close the gate	79.00452506992916
Eight said Aramis it surprises me that two such heroes as Porthos and DArtagnan should have allowed themselves to be arrested by eight men	189.02907857628864
The eight men would doubtless have failed had they not been assisted by twenty soldiers of the regiment of Italians in the kings service who are in garrison in this town so that your friends were overpowered by numbers	155.85303101506113
Arrested were they inquired Athos is it known why	243.40835012422082
No sir they were carried off instantly and had not even time to tell me why but as soon as they were gone I found this broken swordblade as I was helping to raise two dead men and five or six wounded ones	162.8812562641742
Tis still a consolation that they were not wounded said Aramis	221.5003396317863
Where were they taken asked Athos	2162.1735058129548
Toward the town of Louvres was the reply	128.24050243209882
The two friends having agreed to leave Blaisois and Grimaud at Compiegne with the horses resolved to take post horses and having snatched a hasty dinner they continued their journey to Louvres	390.0980473919195
Here they found only one inn in which was consumed a liqueur which preserves its reputation to our time and which is still made in that town	293.8353553669722
Let us alight here said Athos	2354.034573602103
DArtagnan will not have let slip an opportunity of drinking a glass of this liqueur and at the same time leaving some trace of himself	113.18845484793309
They went into the town and asked for two glasses of liqueur at the counteras their friends must have done before them	220.7361580459139
The counter was covered with a plate of pewter upon this plate was written with the point of a large pin Rueil	211.23648415690604
They went to Rueil cried Aramis	4254.197375084383
Let us go to Rueil said Athos	208.45810190813856
It is to throw ourselves into the wolfs jaws said Aramis	518.1390610143399
Had I been as great a friend of Jonah as I am of DArtagnan I should have followed him even into the inside of the whale itself and you would have done the same Aramis	127.16303827946896
Certainlybut you make me out better than I am dear count	151.1576154857619
Had I been alone I should scarcely have gone to Rueil without great caution	227.76738907988263
But where you go I go	87.4822594541845
They then set off for Rueil	14149.924956211573
Here the deputies of the parliament had just arrived in order to enter upon those famous conferences which were to last three weeks and produced eventually that shameful peace at the conclusion of which the prince was arrested	282.6671731025595
Rueil was crowded with advocates presidents and councillors who came from the Parisians and on the side of the court with officers and guards it was therefore easy in the midst of this confusion to remain as unobserved as any one might wish besides the conferences implied a truce and to arrest two gentlemen even Frondeurs at this time would have been an attack on the rights of the people	152.43355216549014
The two friends mingled with the crowd and fancied that every one was occupied with the same thought that tormented them	62.94066099337628
They expected to hear some mention made of DArtagnan or of Porthos but every one was engrossed by articles and reforms	500.9890976837917
It was the advice of Athos to go straight to the minister	102.07953125486964
My friend said Aramis take care our safety lies in our obscurity	516.7854702941848
If we were to make ourselves known we should be sent to rejoin our friends in some deep ditch from which the devil himself could not take us out	178.11834934210916
Let us try not to find them out by accident but from our notions	130.96958378759885
Arrested at Compiegne they have been carried to Rueil at Rueil they have been questioned by the cardinal who has either kept them near him or sent them to Saint Germain	133.27053000084248
As to the Bastile they are not there though the Bastile is especially for the Frondeurs	249.09878184732023
They are not dead for the death of DArtagnan would make a sensation	69.03963581858686
As for Porthos I believe him to be eternal like God although less patient	500.7483003156716
Do not let us despond but wait at Rueil for my conviction is that they are at Rueil	276.88103021382415
But what ails you You are pale	65.4013334787481
It is this answered Athos with a trembling voice	26.368819331195507
I remember that at the Castle of Rueil the Cardinal Richelieu had some horrible oubliettes constructed	1233.2720327101104
Richelieu was a gentleman our equal in birth our superior in position	655.5169388132292
He could like the king touch the greatest of us on the head and touching them make such heads shake on their shoulders	215.88742498650913
But Mazarin is a lowborn rogue who can at the most take us by the collar like an archer	448.98717815328325
Be calmfor I am sure that DArtagnan and Porthos are at Rueil alive and well	569.8175485524039
But resumed Athos I recur to my first proposal	225.23538864150663
I know no better means than to act with candor	110.21869053129065
I shall seek not Mazarin but the queen and say to her Madame restore to us your two servants and our two friends	154.3944565158607
Tis a last resource but let us not employ it till it is imperatively called for let us rather persevere in our researches	204.14073973486782
They continued their inquiries and at last met with a light dragoon who had formed one of the guard which had escorted DArtagnan to Rueil	148.49066686681172
Athos however perpetually recurred to his proposed interview with the queen	209.60039216890107
In order to see the queen said Aramis we must first see the cardinal and when we have seen the cardinalremember what I tell you Athoswe shall be reunited to our friends but not in the way you wish	137.21733497705407
Now that way of joining them is not very attractive to me I confess	133.9998630540877
Let us act in freedom that we may act well and quickly	110.0899763687473
I shall go he said to the queen	36.47955795017253
Well then answered Aramis pray tell me a day or two beforehand that I may take that opportunity of going to Paris	82.89128798975291
Zounds how do I know perhaps to Madame de Longueville	229.62021639784592
She is allpowerful yonder she will help me	21.81525324043376
But send me word should you be arrested for then I will return directly	77.57491632684304
Why do you not take your chance and be arrested with me	112.14328069940687
Should we by being arrested be all four together again we should not I am not sure be twentyfour hours in prison without getting free	244.4293314580112
My friend since I killed Chatillon adored of the ladies of Saint Germain I am too great a celebrity not to fear a prison doubly	350.5643766954817
The queen is likely to follow Mazarins counsels and to have me tried	1171.438751431049
Do you think she loves this Italian so much as they say she does	84.02476922932723
Did she not love an Englishman	1503.8080110230194
My friend she is a woman	56.98437237948205
No no you are deceivedshe is a queen	97.03999669874364
Dear friend I shall sacrifice myself and go and see Anne of Austria	62.662448938589776
Adieu Athos I am going to raise an army	122.29682781007094
To come back and besiege Rueil	478383.0075583591
At the foot of the cardinals gallows	32037.5620236444
The two friends departedAramis to return to Paris Athos to take measures preparatory to an interview with the queen	349.6738526128453
The Gratitude of Anne of Austria	2.858690179265472
Athos found much less difficulty than he had expected in obtaining an audience of Anne of Austria	65.95108988408018
It was granted and was to take place after her mornings levee at which in accordance with his rights of birth he was entitled to be present	223.37259428206062
A vast crowd filled the apartments of Saint Germain	89.9412718288939
Anne had never at the Louvre had so large a court but this crowd represented chiefly the second class of nobility while the Prince de Conti the Duc de Beaufort and the coadjutor assembled around them the first nobility of France	205.95450095601055
The greatest possible gayety prevailed at court	261.6127728272516
The particular characteristic of this was that more songs were made than cannons fired during its continuance	946.3922459578603
The court made songs on the Parisians and the Parisians on the court and the casualties though not mortal were painful as are all wounds inflicted by the weapon of ridicule	275.57511662173425
In the midst of this seeming hilarity nevertheless peoples minds were uneasy	6754.284797730304
Was Mazarin to remain the favorite and minister of the queen Was he to be carried back by the wind which had blown him there Every one hoped so so that the minister felt that all around him beneath the homage of the courtiers lay a fund of hatred ill disguised by fear and interest	247.70399710104905
He felt ill at ease and at a loss what to do	112.41580201635053
Cond himself whilst fighting for him lost no opportunity of ridiculing of humbling him	488.0269869214409
The queen on whom he threw himself as sole support seemed to him now not much to be relied upon	318.88897928069986
When the hour appointed for the audience arrived Athos was obliged to stay until the queen who was waited upon by a new deputation from Paris had consulted with her minister as to the propriety and manner of receiving them	127.05905997381187
All were fully engrossed with the affairs of the day Athos could not therefore have chosen a more inauspicious moment to speak of his friendspoor atoms lost in that raging whirlwind	394.699511341265
But Athos was a man of inflexible determination he firmly adhered to a purpose once formed when it seemed to him to spring from conscience and to be prompted by a sense of duty	244.16644408390005
He insisted on being introduced saying that although he was not a deputy from Monsieur de Conti or Monsieur de Beaufort or Monsieur de Bouillon or Monsieur dElbeuf or the coadjutor or Madame de Longueville or Broussel or the Parliament and although he had come on his own private account he nevertheless had things to say to her majesty of the utmost importance	126.20276387921305
The conference being finished the queen summoned him to her cabinet	480.728367609267
Athos was introduced and announced by name	276.0961008877008
It was a name that too often resounded in her majestys ears and too often vibrated in her heart for Anne of Austria not to recognize it yet she remained impassive looking at him with that fixed stare which is tolerated only in women who are queens either by the power of beauty or by the right of birth	168.20635529345313
It is then a service which you propose to render us count asked Anne of Austria after a moments silence	61.85771223377052
Yes madame another service said Athos shocked that the queen did not seem to recognize him	131.52437564666934
Athos had a noble heart and made therefore but a poor courtier	441.1291048465284
Mazarin who was sitting at a table folding up papers as if he had only been a secretary of state looked up	177.58926040589213
Mazarin turned again to his papers	2646.122902294256
Madame resumed Athos two of my friends named DArtagnan and Monsieur du Vallon sent to England by the cardinal suddenly disappeared when they set foot on the shores of France no one knows what has become of them	74.9517595027938
I address myself therefore first to the benevolence of your majesty that I may know what has become of my friends reserving to myself if necessary the right of appealing hereafter to your justice	153.27291290674572
Sir replied Anne with a degree of haughtiness which to certain persons became impertinence this is the reason that you trouble me in the midst of so many absorbing concerns an affair for the police Well sir you ought to know that we no longer have a police since we are no longer at Paris	127.37057854342471
I think your majesty will have no need to apply to the police to know where my friends are but that if you will deign to interrogate the cardinal he can reply without any further inquiry than into his own recollections	133.84008631548542
But God forgive me cried Anne with that disdainful curl of the lips peculiar to her I believe that you are yourself interrogating	235.15556135249963
Yes madame here I have a right to do so for it concerns Monsieur dArtagnandArtagnan he repeated in such a manner as to bow the regal brow with recollections of the weak and erring woman	143.15745133455744
The cardinal saw that it was now high time to come to the assistance of Anne	85.2785921458786
Sir he said I can tell you what is at present unknown to her majesty	86.6863146336792
I beg of your majesty then said Athos calmly and not replying to Mazarin to quash these arrests of Messieurs dArtagnan and du Vallon	566.9642138873968
What you ask is merely an affair of discipline and does not concern me said the queen	76.29739371827961
Monsieur dArtagnan never made such an answer as that when the service of your majesty was concerned said Athos bowing with great dignity	150.84792404445352
He was going toward the door when Mazarin stopped him	144.80310011751502
You too have been in England sir he said making a sign to the queen who was evidently going to issue a severe order	83.64558671177844
I was a witness of the last hours of Charles I	74.87909792723605
Poor king culpable at the most of weakness how cruelly punished by his subjects Thrones are at this time shaken and it is to little purpose for devoted hearts to serve the interests of princes	432.32828610756604
This is the second time that Monsieur dArtagnan has been in England	130.25786323174813
He went the first time to save the honor of a great queen the second to avert the death of a great king	71.24333287681645
Sir said Anne to Mazarin with an accent from which daily habits of dissimulation could not entirely chase the real expression see if we can do something for these gentlemen	201.84725367524757
I wish to do madame all that your majesty pleases	188.23803039750084
Do what Monsieur de la Fere requests that is your name is it not sir	81.05074503326976
I have another name madameI am called Athos	1926.4801485849955
Madame said Mazarin with a smile you may rest easy your wishes shall be fulfilled	214.93592231003947
You hear sir said the queen	581.2123144150929
Yes madame I expected nothing less from the justice of your majesty	107.75822933918457
May I not go and see my friends	71.54231574143884
Yes sir you shall see them	96.12872062991859
But apropos you belong to the Fronde do you not	42.356887413984516
My way is the way of all gentlemen and I know only one way answered Athos haughtily	187.4816219685308
Go sir then said the queen you have obtained what you wish and we know all we desire to know	75.09465228579869
Scarcely however had the tapestry closed behind Athos when she said to Mazarin	428.09304482103215
Cardinal desire them to arrest that insolent fellow before he leaves the court	428.1422048606567
Your majesty answered Mazarin desires me to do only what I was going to ask you to let me do	28.828157791235874
These bravoes who resuscitate in our epoch the traditions of another reign are troublesome since there are two of them already there let us add a third	251.81612528771808
Athos was not altogether the queens dupe but he was not a man to run away on suspicionabove all when distinctly told that he should see his friends again	172.01927795166856
He waited then in the antechamber with impatience till he should be conducted to them	160.70625141861638
He walked to the window and looked into the court	18.76519581453237
He saw the deputation from the Parisians enter it they were coming to assign the definitive place for the conference and to make their bow to the queen	175.26539483957885
A very imposing escort awaited them without the gates	91.12224846099477
Athos was looking on attentively when some one touched him softly on the shoulder	227.5162254494127
Ah Monsieur de Comminges he said	3.6600267290337953
Yes count and charged with a commission for which I beg of you to accept my excuses	51.92920068424937
Be so good as to give me up your sword count	81.42964731998894
Athos smiled and opened the window	334.4802132004555
Athos fancied he had seen him among the crowd	63.57967987768741
He bowed with great friendship to the count	7.792437201652142
Aramis cried Athos I am arrested	3220.815016101984
Sir said Athos turning to Comminges and giving him politely his sword by the hilt here is my sword have the kindness to keep it safely for me until I quit my prison	181.71546605805702
I prize itit was given to my ancestor by King Francis I	377.0463503944921
In his time they armed gentlemen not disarmed them	1692.3643922903257
Now whither do you conduct me	7.863711691802526
Into my room first replied Comminges the queen will ultimately decide your place of domicile	1450.9478894203376
Athos followed Comminges without saying a single word	18.67254913555667
The arrest produced no sensation indeed was almost unknown and scarcely interrupted the course of events	275.5242178901174
To the deputation it was formally announced that the queen would receive it	286.75934648057705
Accordingly it was admitted to the presence of Anne who silent and lofty as ever listened to the speeches and complaints of the deputies but when they had finished their harangues not one of them could say so calm remained her face whether or no she had heard them	167.28942879371266
On the other hand Mazarin present at that audience heard very well what those deputies demanded	2313.621311546802
It was purely and simply his removal in terms clear and precise	1120.4714855393397
The discourse being finished the queen remained silent	647.9036572459961
Gentlemen said Mazarin I join with you in supplicating the queen to put an end to the miseries of her subjects	83.4818243538958
I have done all in my power to ameliorate them and yet the belief of the public you say is that they proceed from me an unhappy foreigner who has been unable to please the French	88.22418195254967
Alas I have never been understood and no wonder	497.29104956099457
I succeeded a man of the most sublime genius that ever upheld the sceptre of France	393.38949532924573
The memory of Richelieu annihilates me	460.30216044865125
In vainwere I an ambitious manshould I struggle against such remembrances as he has left but that I am not ambitious I am going to prove to you	114.90906479231556
I shall obey the wishes of the people	14.858335673996844
If Paris has injuries to complain of who has not some wrongs to be redressed Paris has been sufficiently punished enough blood has flowed enough misery has humbled a town deprived of its king and of justice	604.091701237676
Tis not for me a private individual to disunite a queen from her kingdom	449.97582309333393
Since you demand my resignation I retire	385.68451338904714
Then said Aramis in his neighbors ear the conferences are over	1394.149492377062
There is nothing to do but to send Monsieur Mazarin to the most distant frontier and to take care that he does not return even by that nor any other entrance into France	178.67903396105265
One instant sir said the man in a gown whom he addressed a plague ont how fast you go one may soon see that you re a soldier	244.59500519427536
There s the article of remunerations and indemnifications to be discussed and set to rights	1045.9266170357491
Chancellor said the queen turning to Seguier our old acquaintance you will open the conferences	304.8331174782641
They can take place at Rueil	11896.912085335069
The cardinal has said several things which have agitated me therefore I will not speak more fully now	141.4113153701369
As to his going or staying I feel too much gratitude to the cardinal not to leave him free in all his actions he shall do what he wishes to do	91.23189333643856
A transient pallor overspread the speaking countenance of the prime minister he looked at the queen with anxiety	139.5359684738105
Her face was so passionless that he as every one else present was incapable of reading her thoughts	300.3968719639408
But added the queen in awaiting the cardinals decision let there be if you please a reference to the king only	311.5608664043261
The deputies bowed and left the room	3.1203093625083786
What exclaimed the queen when the last of them had quitted the apartment you would yield to these limbs of the lawthese advocates	203.611292408056
To promote your majestys welfare madame replied Mazarin fixing his penetrating eyes on the queen there is no sacrifice that I would not make	68.51977662713435
Anne dropped her head and fell into one of those reveries so habitual with her	162.02220599276507
A recollection of Athos came into her mind	72.22022616461106
His fearless deportment his words so firm yet dignified the shades which by one word he had evoked recalled to her the past in all its intoxication of poetry and romance youth beauty the eclat of love at twenty years of age the bloody death of Buckingham the only man whom she had ever really loved and the heroism of those obscure champions who had saved her from the double hatred of Richelieu and the king	188.57314655102172
Mazarin looked at her and whilst she deemed herself alone and freed from the world of enemies who sought to spy into her secret thoughts he read her thoughts in her countenance as one sees in a transparent lake clouds passreflections like thoughts of the heavens	248.7424409566368
Must we then asked Anne of Austria yield to the storm buy peace and patiently and piously await better times	749.7996528564415
Mazarin smiled sarcastically at this speech which showed that she had taken the ministers proposal seriously	314.23630354491814
Annes head was bent downshe had not seen the Italians smile but finding that her question elicited no reply she looked up	263.46829928338724
Well you do not answer cardinal what do you think about it	105.27834406242769
I am thinking madame of the allusion made by that insolent gentleman whom you have caused to be arrested to the Duke of Buckinghamto him whom you allowed to be assassinatedto the Duchess de Chevreuse whom you suffered to be exiledto the Duc de Beaufort whom you imprisoned but if he made allusion to me it was because he is ignorant of the relation in which I stand to you	120.83140137509211
Anne drew up as she always did when anything touched her pride	620.259437835633
She blushed and that she might not answer clasped her beautiful hands till her sharp nails almost pierced them	225.19882937517175
That man has sagacity honor and wit not to mention likewise that he is a man of undoubted resolution	207.4336633388665
You know something about him do you not madame I shall tell him therefore and in doing so I shall confer a personal favor on him how he is mistaken in regard to me	82.6457972828746
What is proposed to me would be in fact almost an abdication and an abdication requires reflection	1079.1399714123895
An abdication repeated Anne I thought sir that it was kings alone who abdicated	466.2038762599295
Well replied Mazarin and am I not almost a kingking indeed of France Thrown over the foot of the royal bed my simar madame looks not unlike the mantle worn by kings	460.47963844208283
This was one of the humiliations which Mazarin made Anne undergo more frequently than any other and one that bowed her head with shame	347.96588203591887
of Russia are the only two monarchs of their set on record who were at once sovereigns and lovers	742.0534207341802
Anne of Austria looked with a sort of terror at the threatening aspect of the cardinalhis physiognomy in such moments was not destitute of a certain grandeur	163.92196084438524
Sir she replied did I not say and did you not hear me say to those people that you should do as you pleased	74.69949074901548
In that case said Mazarin I think it must please me best to remain not only on account of my own interest but for your safety	77.30489972952608
Remain then sir nothing can be more agreeable to me only do not allow me to be insulted	37.389774116184746
You are referring to the demands of the rebels and to the tone in which they stated them Patience They have selected a field of battle on which I am an abler general than theythat of a conference	291.07855069140385
No we shall beat them by merely temporizing	4528.374832087035
They will be ten times worse off in a week	136.29992235127028
Ah yes Good heavens I know it will end in that way but it is not they who taunt me with the most wounding reproaches but	115.41949575804942
I understand you mean to allude to the recollections perpetually revived by these three gentlemen	375.1321879410411
However we have them safe in prison and they are just sufficiently culpable for us to keep them in prison as long as we find it convenient	110.82322900263122
One only is still not in our power and braves us	113.25888396648648
But devil take him we shall soon succeed in sending him to join his boon companions	210.99965588957815
We have accomplished more difficult things than that	116.93542654691525
In the first place I have as a precaution shut up at Rueil near me under my own eyes within reach of my hand the two most intractable ones	339.5040965586842
Today the third will be there also	258.80992997677004
As long as they are in prison all will be well said Anne but one of these days they will get out	98.98582554685358
Yes if your majesty releases them	876.5521566584147
Ah exclaimed Anne following the train of her own thoughts on such occasions one regrets Paris	292.0995268528581
On account of the Bastile sir which is so strong and so secure	166.74615096998662
Madame these conferences will bring us peace when we have peace we shall regain Paris with Paris the Bastile and our four bullies shall rot therein	324.4353483252789
Anne frowned slightly when Mazarin in taking leave kissed her hand	324.8980109926117
Mazarin after this half humble half gallant attention went away	1109.7087101830816
Anne followed him with her eyes and as he withdrew at every step he took a disdainful smile was seen playing then gradually burst upon her lips	103.66677172554951
I once she said despised the love of a cardinal who never said I shall do but I have done so and so	54.786309007732335
That man knew of retreats more secure than Rueil darker and more silent even than the Bastile	423.5895058810257
After quitting Anne Mazarin took the road to Rueil where he usually resided in those times of disturbance he went about with numerous followers and often disguised himself	234.25861937073165
In military dress he was indeed as we have stated a very handsome man	59.45387724353053
In the court of the old Chateau of Saint Germain he entered his coach and reached the Seine at Chatou	297.2981062471045
The prince had supplied him with fifty light horse not so much by way of guard as to show the deputies how readily the queens generals dispersed their troops and to prove that they might be safely scattered at pleasure	388.55307361722646
Athos on horseback without his sword and kept in sight by Comminges followed the cardinal in silence	302.12782491394097
Grimaud finding that his master had been arrested fell back into the ranks near Aramis without saying a word and as if nothing had happened	76.53759797255701
Grimaud had indeed during twentytwo years of service seen his master extricate himself from so many difficulties that nothing less than Athoss imminent death was likely to make him uneasy	245.6654372685634
At the branching off of the road toward Paris Aramis who had followed in the cardinals suite turned back	162.82070843493014
Mazarin went to the right hand and Aramis could see the prisoner disappear at the turning of the avenue	80.51690246684602
Athos at the same moment moved by a similar impulse looked back also	325.726925851056
The two friends exchanged a simple inclination of the head and Aramis put his finger to his hat as if to bow Athos alone comprehending by that signal that he had some project in his head	150.96746068270787
Ten minutes afterward Mazarin entered the court of that chateau which his predecessor had built for him at Rueil as he alighted Comminges approached him	207.8703873964582
My lord he asked where does your eminence wish Monsieur Comte de la Fere to be lodged	131.23823184033154
In the pavilion of the orangery of course in front of the pavilion where the guard is	174.40340967966534
I wish every respect to be shown the count although he is the prisoner of her majesty the queen	95.4710204876527
My lord answered Comminges he begs to be taken to the place where Monsieur dArtagnan is confinedthat is in the hunting lodge opposite the orangery	307.3210916547011
Comminges saw that he was undecided	83085.64165725812
Tis a very strong post he resumed and we have forty good men tried soldiers having no connection with Frondeurs nor any interest in the Fronde	414.30151618949776
If we put these three men together Monsieur Comminges said Mazarin we must double the guard and we are not rich enough in fighting men to commit such acts of prodigality	232.58093572732975
Comminges smiled Mazarin read and construed that smile	3398.9054683100044
You do not know these men Monsieur Comminges but I know them first personally also by hearsay	673.9055012677916
I sent them to carry aid to King Charles and they performed prodigies to save him had it not been for an adverse destiny that beloved monarch would this day have been among us	390.3391744397557
But since they served your eminence so well why are they my lord cardinal in prison	254.37419038313604
In prison said Mazarin and when has Rueil been a prison	586.3692592843339
Ever since there were prisoners in it answered Comminges	615.4356429066448
These gentlemen Comminges are not prisoners returned Mazarin with his ironical smile only guests but guests so precious that I have put a grating before each of their windows and bolts to their doors that they may not refuse to continue my visitors	233.27350854716673
So much do I esteem them that I am going to make the Comte de la Fere a visit that I may converse with him teteatete and that we may not be disturbed at our interview you must conduct him as I said before to the pavilion of the orangery that you know is my daily promenade	72.40598322343018
Well while taking my walk I will call on him and we will talk	35.776045919586196
Although he professes to be my enemy I have sympathy for him and if he is reasonable perhaps we shall arrange matters	164.2881942718085
Comminges bowed and returned to Athos who was awaiting with apparent calmness but with real anxiety the result of the interview	72.30109441994647
Well he said to the lieutenant	3410.3399614295463
Sir replied Comminges it seems that it is impossible	12.65743228762092
Monsieur de Comminges said Athos I have been a soldier all my life and I know the force of orders but outside your orders there is a service you can render me	67.69346539132393
I will do it with all my heart said Comminges for I know who you are and what service you once performed for her majesty I know too how dear to you is the young man who came so valiantly to my aid when that old rogue of a Broussel was arrested	168.75917053394573
I am entirely at your service except only for my orders	172.68515538537338
Thank you sir what I am about to ask will not compromise you in any degree	75.0245270237764
If it should even compromise me a little said Monsieur de Comminges with a smile still make your demand	157.7517771548631
I do nt like Mazarin any better than you do	30.674865792247672
I serve the queen and that draws me naturally into the service of the cardinal but I serve the one with joy and the other against my will	114.77258217045586
Speak then I beg of you I wait and listen	90.19454567395782
Since there is no harm said Athos in my knowing that DArtagnan is here I presume there will be none in his knowing that I am here	111.26176327488122
I have received no orders on that point	40.07970300184717
Well then do me the kindness to give him my regards and tell him that I am his neighbor	81.98335344509162
Tell him also what you have just told methat Mazarin has placed me in the pavilion of the orangery in order to make me a visit and assure him that I shall take advantage of this honor he proposes to accord to me to obtain from him some amelioration of our captivity	120.11227472444547
Which can not last interrupted Comminges the cardinal said so there is no prison here	218.88036352132383
But there are oubliettes replied Athos smiling	263.9798511659292
Oh that s a different thing yes I know there are traditions of that sort said Comminges	159.5272576698982
It was in the time of the other cardinal who was a great nobleman but our Mazarinimpossible an Italian adventurer would not dare to go such lengths with such men as ourselves	232.91770665742453
Oubliettes are employed as a means of kingly vengeance and a lowborn fellow such as he is would not have recourse to them	186.96389312225057
Your arrest is known that of your friends will soon be known and all the nobility of France would demand an explanation of your disappearance	78.21917441477503
No no be easy on that score	33.91493802312129
I will however inform Monsieur dArtagnan of your arrival here	198.09824489008335
Comminges then led the count to a room on the ground floor of a pavilion at the end of the orangery	24.87105697391372
They passed through a courtyard as they went full of soldiers and courtiers	185.9915888216258
In the centre of this court in the form of a horseshoe were the buildings occupied by Mazarin and at each wing the pavilion or smaller building where DArtagnan was confined and that level with the orangery where Athos was to be	365.9245880867878
From the ends of these two wings extended the park	367.9259828720776
Athos when he reached his appointed room observed through the gratings of his window walls and roofs and was told on inquiry by Comminges that he was looking on the back of the pavilion where DArtagnan was confined	189.08081343688153
Yes tis too true said Comminges tis almost a prison but what a singular fancy this is of yours countyou who are the very flower of our nobilityto squander your valor and loyalty amongst these upstarts the Frondists Really count if ever I thought that I had a friend in the ranks of the royal army it was you	312.13293515062895
A Frondeur you the Comte de la Fere on the side of Broussel Blancmesnil and Viole For shame you a Frondeur	288.3072651767027
On my word of honor said Athos one must be either a Mazarinist or a Frondeur	211.9734559316822
For a long time I had these words whispered in my ears and I chose the latter at any rate it is a French word	127.97998984308632
And now I am a Frondeurnot of Broussels party nor of Blancmesnils nor am I with Viole but with the Duc de Beaufort the Ducs de Bouillon and dElbeuf with princes not with presidents councillors and lowborn lawyers	687.5354345135092
Besides what a charming outlook it would have been to serve the cardinal Look at that wallwithout a single windowwhich tells you fine things about Mazarins gratitude	445.56676621360606
Yes replied De Comminges more especially if it could reveal how Monsieur dArtagnan for this last week has been anathematizing him	209.31669348447804
Poor DArtagnan said Athos with the charming melancholy that was one of the traits of his character so brave so good so terrible to the enemies of those he loves	85.23156394270093
You have two unruly prisoners there sir	388.66823608177367
Unruly Comminges smiled you wish to terrify me I suppose	98.93032551088368
When he came here Monsieur DArtagnan provoked and braved the soldiers and inferior officers in order I suppose to have his sword back	447.28302857598294
That mood lasted some time but now he s as gentle as a lamb and sings Gascon songs which make one die of laughing	472.1077182074298
Ah he s quite another sort of persona formidable gentleman indeed	1755.7326683056333
The first day he broke all the doors in with a single push of his shoulder and I expected to see him leave Rueil in the same way as Samson left Gaza	134.98052039485788
But his temper cooled down like his friends he not only gets used to his captivity but jokes about it	322.75690289417486
So much the better said Athos	3029.3194038743213
Do you think anything else was to be expected of them asked Comminges who putting together what Mazarin had said of his prisoners and what the Comte de la Fere had said began to feel a degree of uneasiness	128.60812085252726
Athos on the other hand reflected that this recent gentleness of his friends most certainly arose from some plan formed by DArtagnan	554.6098641961848
Unwilling to injure them by praising them too highly he replied They They are two hotheadsthe one a Gascon the other from Picardy both are easily excited but they quiet down immediately	820.9542278743337
You have had a proof of that in what you have just related to me	29.300939036396493
This too was the opinion of Comminges who withdrew somewhat reassured	747.9927645785032
Athos remained alone in the vast chamber where according to the cardinals directions he was treated with all the courtesy due to a nobleman	171.46186539561117
He awaited Mazarins promised visit to get some light on his present situation	197.87451975996476
Now let us pass the orangery to the hunting lodge	771.1925328645123
At the extremity of the courtyard where close to a portico formed of Ionic columns were the dog kennels rose an oblong building the pavilion of the orangery a half circle inclosing the court of honor	507.1757313909597
It was in this pavilion on the ground floor that DArtagnan and Porthos were confined suffering interminable hours of imprisonment in a manner suitable to each different temperament	410.66387976358766
DArtagnan was pacing to and fro like a caged tiger with dilated eyes growling as he paced along by the bars of a window looking upon the yard of servants offices	166.42281707356065
Porthos was ruminating over an excellent dinner he had just demolished	255.4405067286538
The one seemed to be deprived of reason yet he was meditating	295.88420464172424
The other seemed to meditate yet he was more than half asleep	107.16911805437849
But his sleep was a nightmare which might be guessed by the incoherent manner in which he sometimes snored and sometimes snorted	337.1050538153126
Look said DArtagnan day is declining	192115.23232557054
It must be nearly four oclock	43.28565608796458
We have been in this place nearly eightythree hours	1463.3516760054279
Hem muttered Porthos with a kind of pretense of answering	332.6121350451224
Did you hear eternal sleeper cried DArtagnan irritated that any one could doze during the day when he had the greatest difficulty in sleeping during the night	170.24436203634383
I say we have been here eightythree hours	3014.625190901752
By pulling out a bar and pushing down a door	67.75962140867173
Porthos men like us ca nt go out from here purely and simply	96.10816030263258
Faith said Porthos as for me I could go out with that purity and that simplicity which it seems to me you despise too much	75.97890178109432
And besides he said going out of this chamber is nt all	74.28360455699466
Dear friend said Porthos you appear to be in a somewhat better humor today than you were yesterday	143.7489420527874
Explain to me why going out of this chamber is nt everything	115.34847819531383
Because having neither arms nor password we should nt take fifty steps in the court without knocking against a sentinel	243.12029751003726
Very well said Porthos we will kill the sentinel and we shall have his arms	53.34498638130921
Yes but before we can kill himand he will be hard to kill that Swisshe will shriek out and the whole picket will come and we shall be taken like foxes we who are lions and thrown into some dungeon where we shall not even have the consolation of seeing this frightful gray sky of Rueil which no more resembles the sky of Tarbes than the moon is like the sun	221.658074617826
Lackaday if we only had some one to instruct us about the physical and moral topography of this castle	307.46549677009375
Ah when one thinks that for twenty years during which time I did not know what to do with myself it never occurred to me to come to study Rueil	67.03199642461296
What difference does that make said Porthos	916.3733248063497
We shall go out all the same	11.814406086116856
Do you know my dear fellow why master pastrycooks never work with their hands	715.9120307909764
No said Porthos but I should be glad to be informed	42.76261371509209
It is because in the presence of their pupils they fear that some of their tarts or creams may turn out badly cooked	760.3773582439242
Why then they would be laughed at and a master pastrycook must never be laughed at	568.9039251409852
And what have master pastrycooks to do with us	28.343172163510737
We ought in our adventures never to be defeated or give any one a chance to laugh at us	220.11551748580507
In England lately we failed we were beaten and that is a blemish on our reputation	335.7248617940335
By whom then were we beaten asked Porthos	1943.158695929744
Yes but we have drowned Monsieur Mordaunt	2803.322180408676
That is true and that will redeem us a little in the eyes of posterity if posterity ever looks at us	286.1659732253417
But listen Porthos though Monsieur Mordaunt was a man not to be despised Mazarin is not less strong than he and we shall not easily succeed in drowning him	131.0258474544254
We must therefore watch and play a close game for he added with a sigh we two are equal perhaps to eight others but we are not equal to the four that you know of	134.85499003173348
That is true said Porthos echoing DArtagnans sigh	43740.55678883545
Well Porthos follow my examples walk back and forth till some news of our friends reaches us or till we are visited by a good idea	175.1202939727567
But do nt sleep as you do all the time nothing dulls the intellect like sleep	427.22870492074304
As to what may lie before us it is perhaps less serious than we at first thought	108.51784858295643
I do nt believe that Monsieur de Mazarin thinks of cutting off our heads for heads are not taken off without previous trial a trial would make a noise and a noise would get the attention of our friends who would check the operations of Monsieur de Mazarin	166.44772235739433
How well you reason said Porthos admiringly	39031.30267990648
Well yes pretty well replied DArtagnan and besides you see if they put us on trial if they cut off our heads they must meanwhile either keep us here or transfer us elsewhere	228.58896248045704
Yes that is inevitable said Porthos	2896.87227905536
Well it is impossible but that Master Aramis that keenscented bloodhound and Athos that wise and prudent nobleman will discover our retreat	1832.7096660256584
Then believe me it will be time to act	74.39027701397961
We can wait the more contentedly that it is not absolutely bad here but for one thing at least	141.01362360586938
Did you observe DArtagnan that three days running they have brought us braised mutton	821.7058152846323
No but if it occurs a fourth time I shall complain of it so never mind	148.21047072480022
And then I feel the loss of my house tis a long time since I visited my castles	129.49419974101403
Forget them for a time we shall return to them unless Mazarin razes them to the ground	158.65577160216918
No the other cardinal would have done so but this one is too mean a fellow to risk it	110.79755201111035
Well then assume a cheerful manner as I do we must joke with the guards we must gain the goodwill of the soldiers since we ca nt corrupt them	148.24096782947836
Try Porthos to please them more than you are wo nt to do when they are under our windows	42.800403030285935
Thus far you have done nothing but show them your fist and the more respectable your fist is Porthos the less attractive it is	364.73335510149866
Ah I would give much to have five hundred louis only	89.28903289971844
So would I said Porthos unwilling to be behind DArtagnan in generosity I would give as much as a hundred pistoles	255.8504642517665
The two prisoners were at this point of their conversation when Comminges entered preceded by a sergeant and two men who brought supper in a basket with two handles filled with basins and plates	188.6036574287923
My dear Monsieur de Comminges said DArtagnan you will find that my friend Monsieur du Vallon will go to the most fatal lengths if Cardinal Mazarin continues to provide us with this sort of meat mutton every day	254.08432543337608
I declare said Porthos I shall eat nothing if they do not take it away	54.48803991275944
Remove the mutton cried Comminges I wish Monsieur du Vallon to sup well more especially as I have news to give him that will improve his appetite	207.23118835692256
No I am sorry to tell you he is perfectly well	50.138455866969466
So much the worse said Porthos	3121.3964681163893
What is that news asked DArtagnan	5439.011923538061
News in prison is a fruit so rare that I trust Monsieur de Comminges you will excuse my impatiencethe more eager since you have given us to understand that the news is good	112.31247607055785
Should you be glad to hear that the Comte de la Fere is well asked De Comminges	58.073992644254155
DArtagnans penetrating gray eyes were opened to the utmost	93.94752216066571
Glad he cried I should be more than glad Happybeyond measure	1122.7952313493638
Well I am desired by him to give you his compliments and to say that he is in good health	73.66892838602563
A quick glance conveyed his thought to Porthos If Athos knows where we are if he opens communication with us before long Athos will act	507.7006869736246
Porthos was not very quick to understand the language of glances but now since the name of Athos had suggested to him the same idea he understood	85.30365080119891
Do you say asked the Gascon timidly that the Comte de la Fere has commissioned you to give his compliments to Monsieur du Vallon and myself	94.51167033397877
Where if I may ask without indiscretion	3276.6484298460446
Near here replied De Comminges smiling so near that if the windows which look on the orangery were not stopped up you could see him from where you are	131.09076514930405
He is wandering about the environs of the castle thought DArtagnan	604.6874502555829
You met him I dare say in the parkhunting perhaps	705.8412838721498
Look behind this wall said De Comminges knocking against the wall	572.7971087898004
Behind this wall What is there then behind this wall I was brought here by night so devil take me if I know where I am	115.76139922328682
Well said Comminges suppose one thing	20.04293342774848
I will suppose anything you please	187.19110570575748
Suppose there were a window in this wall	130.83673431701348
From that window you would see Monsieur de la Fere at his	64.42872217941593
The count then is in the chateau	369.4712599939822
You know well replied De Comminges that there are no prisoners at Rueil because there is no prison	145.45213380698925
Do nt let us play upon words sir	216.75692194207906
Yesterday at Saint Germain as he came out from the presence of the queen	42.422527140876255
The arms of DArtagnan fell powerless by his side	69.91709350302287
One might have supposed him thunderstruck a paleness ran like a cloud over his dark skin but disappeared immediately	531.8913056883483
A prisoner repeated Porthos quite dejected	21861.9127707135
Suddenly DArtagnan looked up and in his eyes there was a gleam which scarcely even Porthos observed but it died away and he appeared more sorrowful than before	133.02410645953654
Come come said Comminges who since DArtagnan on the day of Broussels arrest had saved him from the hands of the Parisians had entertained a real affection for him do nt be unhappy I never thought of bringing you bad news	112.33292359103133
Laugh at the chance which has brought your friend near to you and Monsieur du Vallon instead of being in the depths of despair about it	88.40517197531588
But DArtagnan was still in a desponding mood	2394.9120411008153
And how did he look asked Porthos who perceiving that DArtagnan had allowed the conversation to drop profited by it to put in a word or two	203.7081399515898
Very well indeed sir replied Comminges at first like you he seemed distressed but when he heard that the cardinal was going to pay him a visit this very evening	125.54796852090682
Ah cried DArtagnan the cardinal is about to visit the Comte de la Fere	23.17806213243072
Yes and the count desired me to tell you that he should take advantage of this visit to plead for you and for himself	31.323566832558242
Ah our dear count said DArtagnan	8806.104513717271
A fine thing indeed grunted Porthos	1919.229402074784
A great favor Zounds Monsieur the Comte de la Fere whose family is allied to the Montmorency and the Rohan is easily the equal of Monsieur de Mazarin	118.05526304293649
No matter said DArtagnan in his most wheedling tone	197.00935717265605
On reflection my dear Du Vallon it is a great honor for the Comte de la Fere and gives good reason to hope	43.58834964444154
In fact it seems to me so great an honor for a prisoner that I think Monsieur de Comminges must be mistaken	82.11026335203265
Monsieur de Mazarin will not come to visit the Comte de la Fere but the Comte de la Fere will be sent for to visit him	27.862166137698694
No no no said Comminges who made a point of having the facts appear exactly as they were I clearly understood what the cardinal said to me	169.93677687032513
He will come and visit the Comte de la Fere	13.975092556498874
DArtagnan tried to gather from the expression of his eyes whether Porthos understood the importance of that visit but Porthos did not even look toward him	104.21071562600656
It is then the cardinals custom to walk in his orangery asked DArtagnan	706.1751321943772
Every evening he shuts himself in there	704.0306014063709
That it seems is where he meditates on state affairs	1362.7807785809196
In that case said DArtagnan I begin to believe that Monsieur de la Fere will receive the visit of his eminence he will of course have an escort	95.55222155510292
And will he talk thus of affairs in presence of two strangers	260.04898062555253
The soldiers are Swiss who understand only German	2024.7563233732687
Besides according to all probability they will wait at the door	37.58472292956328
DArtagnan made a violent effort over himself to keep his face from being too expressive	150.5939712666339
Let the cardinal take care of going alone to visit the Comte de la Fere said DArtagnan for the count must be furious	55.0014382271233
Oh oh why really one would say that you four were anthropaphagi The count is an affable man besides he is unarmed at the first word from his eminence the two soldiers about him would run to his assistance	121.21394728266473
Two soldiers said DArtagnan seeming to remember something two soldiers yes that then is why I hear two men called every evening and see them walking sometimes for half an hour under my window	231.99114675757576
That is it they are waiting for the cardinal or rather for Bernouin who comes to call them when the cardinal goes out	158.95220959811323
Finelooking men upon my word said DArtagnan	244.81348279544233
They belong to the regiment that was at Lens which the prince assigned to the cardinal	179.06101168809954
Ah monsieur said DArtagnan as if to sum up in a word all that conversation if only his eminence would relent and grant to Monsieur de la Fere our liberty	342.73756945578316
I wish it with all my heart said Comminges	62.84692508647924
Then if he should forget that visit you would find no inconvenience in reminding him of it	167.18736906852163
Ah that gives me more confidence	451.35993805634314
This skillful turn of the conversation would have seemed a sublime manoeuvre to any one who could have read the Gascons soul	220.9495654515645
Now said DArtagnan I ve one last favor to ask of you Monsieur de Comminges	142.05674285795
You will see the count again	111.46937456114671
Will you remember us to him and ask him to solicit for me the same favor that he will have obtained	102.15612602770383
You want the cardinal to come here	108.5148495505873
No I know my place and am not so presumptuous	252.8962067588074
Let his eminence do me the honor to give me a hearing that is all I want	36.21352450906483
Oh muttered Porthos shaking his head never should I have thought this of him How misfortune humbles a man	355.8332042338494
I promise you it shall be done answered De Comminges	219.4124130659377
Tell the count that I am well that you found me sad but resigned	251.32405786168854
I am pleased sir to hear that	93.73728150557932
And the same also for Monsieur du Vallon	366.18984807695193
Not for me cried Porthos I am not by any means resigned	84.88270551961877
But you will be resigned my friend	62.6845078359692
He will become so monsieur I know him better than he knows himself	64.44581740464055
Be silent dear Du Vallon and resign yourself	288.5067460847039
Adieu gentlemen said De Comminges sleep well	8435.134112621996
De Comminges went away DArtagnan remaining apparently in the same attitude of humble resignation but scarcely had he departed when he turned and clasped Porthos in his arms with an expression not to be doubted	146.29727602340128
Oh cried Porthos what s the matter now Have you gone mad my dear friend	62.897841427435274
What is the matter returned DArtagnan we are saved	330.9471056492779
I do nt see that at all answered Porthos	580.8370445724606
I think we are all taken prisoners except Aramis and that our chances of getting out are lessened since one more of us is caught in Mazarins mousetrap	767.8288742338781
Which is far too strong for two of us but not strong enough for three of us returned DArtagnan	134.97176218893784
I do nt understand said Porthos	849.4174019013616
Never mind lets sit down to table and take something to strengthen us for the night	87.49187144949849
What are we to do then tonight	134.97947866002482
Sit down dear friend to table	9105.582372636016
When one is eating ideas flow easily	40644.17535281131
After supper when they are perfected I will communicate my plans to you	229.67592419298336
So Porthos sat down to table without another word and ate with an appetite that did honor to the confidence that was ever inspired in him by DArtagnans inventive imagination	273.71980633690146
Supper was eaten in silence but not in sadness for from time to time one of those sweet smiles which were habitual to him in moments of goodhumor illumined the face of DArtagnan	108.74315842122458
Not a scintilla of these was lost on Porthos and at every one he uttered an exclamation which betrayed to his friend that he had not lost sight of the idea which possessed his brain	71.17874475870441
At dessert DArtagnan reposed in his chair crossed one leg over the other and lounged about like a man perfectly at his ease	129.67838737385947
Porthos rested his chin on his hands placed his elbows on the table and looked at DArtagnan with an expression of confidence which imparted to that colossus an admirable appearance of goodfellowship	82.29374381641416
You were saying my dear friend	17.505589289291535
Yes you were saying you wished to leave this place	57.779461610612366
Ah indeed the will was never wanting	1552.2895631781732
To get away you would not mind you added knocking down a door or a wall	122.7347893982141
Tis trueI said so and I say it again	30.754697154431824
And I answered you Porthos that it was not a good plan that we could nt go a hundred steps without being recaptured because we were without clothes to disguise ourselves and arms to defend ourselves	203.04836287077367
That is true we should need clothes and arms	1045.622045496507
Well said DArtagnan rising we have them friend Porthos and even something better	418.78930438354996
Useless to look everything will come to us when wanted	214.8605993714818
At about what time did we see the two Swiss guards walking yesterday	638.6734892006525
If they go out today as they did yesterday we shall have the honor then of seeing them in half an hour	61.42227824699954
In a quarter of an hour at most	197.07638106878477
Your arm is still strong enough is it not Porthos	112.65184327677567
Porthos unbuttoned his sleeve raised his shirt and looked complacently on his strong arm as large as the leg of any ordinary man	106.32112380605206
Yes indeed said he I believe so	88.64531837362301
So that you could without trouble convert these tongs into a hoop and yonder shovel into a corkscrew	1488.610856926367
And the giant took up these two articles and without any apparent effort produced in them the metamorphoses suggested by his companion	233.3957297968444
Really Porthos you are a gifted individual	18538.249537696847
I have heard speak said Porthos of a certain Milo of Crotona who performed wonderful feats such as binding his forehead with a cord and bursting itof killing an ox with a blow of his fist and carrying it home on his shoulders et cetera	333.9519345531577
I used to learn all these feat by heart yonder down at Pierrefonds and I have done all that he did except breaking a cord by the corrugation of my temples	279.28510658121735
Because your strength is not in your head Porthos said his friend	152.1923616990308
No it is in my arms and shoulders answered Porthos with gratified naivete	1367.6277640009926
Well my dear friend let us approach the window and there you can match your strength against that of an iron bar	133.56313274710288
Porthos went to the window took a bar in his hands clung to it and bent it like a bow so that the two ends came out of the sockets of stone in which for thirty years they had been fixed	80.11383130801701
Well friend the cardinal although such a genius could never have done that	58.31207586947384
Shall I take out any more of them asked Porthos	182.25426193847818
No that is sufficient a man can pass through that	71.6900989262887
Porthos tried and passed the upper portion of his body through	121.87347338964425
Now pass your arm through this opening	33.68072825008469
Porthos obeyed with military promptness and passed his arm through the opening	30.45851875621231
The scheme goes forward it seems	183.25626432195298
Good What shall I do now	308.87506017567745
I should like to understand said Porthos	340.43485944351795
Listen my dear friend in two words you will know all	43.170849523065904
The door of the guardhouse opens as you see	229.63301083038766
They are about to send into our court which Monsieur de Mazarin crosses on his way to the orangery the two guards who attend him	199.00481844561943
If only they close the guardhouse door Good They close it	4249.641305473492
I do nt understand it at all	159.57709667594702
As you execute you will understand	177.69743865179456
And yet I should have preferred	4910.819212288287
You will have the pleasure of the surprise	48.594706391043374
In fact the two soldiers advanced on the side where the window was rubbing their hands for it was cold it being the month of February	108.28019273786035
At this moment the door of the guardhouse was opened and one of the soldiers was summoned away	54.699935012447334
Now said DArtagnan I am going to call this soldier and talk to him	60.916924003238485
Do nt lose a word of what I m going to say to you Porthos	40.42356352088136
Good the execution of plots is my forte	1163.2011696100224
Look I shall turn to the left so that the soldier will be at your right as soon as he mounts on the bench to talk to us	81.64574746968711
But supposing he does nt mount	8863.050986132706
As soon as you see him get up stretch out your arm and seize him by the neck	120.73457864119926
Then raising him up as Tobit raised the fish by the gills you must pull him into the room taking care to squeeze him so tight that he ca nt cry out	186.30629002445906
Suppose I happen to strangle him	14.474180119160373
To be sure there would only be a Swiss the less in the world but you will not do so I hope	48.603425094081445
Lay him down here well gag him and tie himno matter wheresomewhere	15789.759032344315
So we shall get from him one uniform and a sword	157.5856166941416
Marvelous exclaimed Porthos looking at the Gascon with the most profound admiration	69.7458134305008
Yes said Porthos recollecting himself but one uniform and one sword will not suffice for two	231.75432979411278
Well but there s his comrade	2782.1432633138916
Therefore when I cough stretch out your arm	44.05111045986487
The two friends then placed themselves as they had agreed Porthos being completely hidden in an angle of the window	152.03556740444813
Goodevening comrade said DArtagnan in his most fascinating voice and manner	129.08598837027077
Goodevening sir answered the soldier in a strong provincial accent	309.05719259272763
Tis not too warm to walk resumed DArtagnan	8463.244305365737
And I think a glass of wine will not be disagreeable to you	25.91343678087831
A glass of wine will be extremely welcome	406.581550683004
The fish bitesthe fish bites whispered the Gascon to Porthos	373.43385304049656
A whole bottle if you will drink my health	77.34917887847992
Come then and take it friend said the Gascon	452.8991163647577
How convenient that there s a bench here	244.39511778062547
Egad one would think it had been placed here on purpose	95.48514159956207
Get on it that s it friend	154.8487383895044
That instant the arm of Porthos fell	1418.6575501592113
His hand of iron grasped quick as lightning firm as a pair of blacksmiths pincers the soldiers throat	395.26047128731796
He raised him almost stifling him as he drew him through the aperture at the risk of flaying him in the passage	60.96759156566812
He then laid him down on the floor where DArtagnan after giving him just time enough to draw his breath gagged him with his long scarf and the moment he had done so began to undress him with the promptitude and dexterity of a man who had learned his business on the field of battle	82.74472338759851
Then the soldier gagged and bound was placed upon the hearth the fire of which had been previously extinguished by the two friends	78.05016260218441
Heres a sword and a dress said Porthos	817.386119797256
I take them said DArtagnan for myself	70.41077120190401
If you want another uniform and sword you must play the same trick over again	382.5000020691556
Stop I see the other soldier issue from the guardroom and come toward us	719.8002028240742
I think replied Porthos it would be imprudent to attempt the same manoeuvre again it is said that no man can succeed twice in the same way and a failure would be ruinous	119.316438444836
No I will go down seize the man unawares and bring him to you ready gagged	546.7728924194269
That is better said the Gascon	475.7902346861272
Be ready said Porthos as he slipped through the opening	56.19047846275635
Porthos seized his opportunity caught the next soldier by his neck gagged him and pushed him like a mummy through the bars into the room and entered after him	145.4618973525411
Then they undressed him as they had done the first laid him on their bed and bound him with the straps which composed the bedthe bedstead being of oak	157.08241093213033
This operation proved as great a success as the first	178.92360604583084
There said DArtagnan this is capital Now let me try on the dress of yonder chap	764.6762146119694
Porthos I doubt if you can wear it but should it be too tight never mind you can wear the breastplate and the hat with the red feathers	198.27893263324611
It happened however that the second soldier was a Swiss of gigantic proportions so save that some few of the seams split his uniform fitted Porthos perfectly	863.1018888013513
Tis done they both exclaimed at once	31.762687310957638
As to you comrades they said to the men nothing will happen to you if you are discreet but if you stir you are dead men	119.11123911874395
The soldiers were complaisant they had found the grasp of Porthos pretty powerful and that it was no joke to fight against it	134.44755058071843
Now said DArtagnan you would nt be sorry to understand the plot would you Porthos	179.21059635698492
Well then we shall go down into the court	13.394826970813474
We shall take the place of those two fellows	153.6647559305254
We will walk back and forth	18022.538546597254
That s a good idea for it is nt warm	86.64293561453924
In a moment the valetdechambre will call the guard as he did yesterday and the day before	89.57125077275887
No on the contrary we shall not answer	29.3117394632093
As you please I do nt insist on answering	1101.971874601549
We will not answer then we will simply settle our hats on our heads and we will escort his eminence	320.2808422154325
Where he is goingto visit Athos	98720.5724049905
Do you think Athos will be sorry to see us	36.44379132976884
Oh cried Porthos oh I understand	70.13854818097568
Wait a little Porthos before crying out for on my word you have nt reached the end said the Gascon in a jesting tone	85.80209608370396
What is to happen said Porthos	2730.8997629840064
The man who lives to see shall see	130.28768104238813
And slipping through the aperture he alighted in the court	48.874469599073365
Porthos followed him by the same road but with more difficulty and less diligence	287.1012500651795
They could hear the two soldiers shivering with fear as they lay bound in the chamber	225.39238856727576
Scarcely had the two Frenchmen touched the ground when a door opened and the voice of the valetdechambre called out	65.79526422544232
At the same moment the guardhouse was opened and a voice called out	146.17094092956208
La Bruyere and Du Barthois March	17092.745559640185
It seems that I am named La Bruyere remarked DArtagnan	4229.85801826365
And I Du Barthois added Porthos	3599.214263395621
Where are you asked the valetdechambre whose eyes dazzled by the light could not clearly distinguish our heroes in the gloom	401.8007220972264
Here we are said the Gascon	820.8680963685495
What say you to that Monsieur du Vallon he added in a low tone to Porthos	57.934430751517645
If it but lasts most capital responded Porthos	6783.230364673826
These two newly enlisted soldiers marched gravely after the valetdechambre who opened the door of the vestibule then another which seemed to be that of a waitingroom and showing them two stools	213.83928870686668
Your orders are very simple he said do nt allow anybody except one person to enter here	191.30356401605164
Do you hearnot a single creature Obey that person implicitly	3438.7554422668863
On your return you can not make a mistake	28.11285821397484
You have only to wait here till I release you	103.27837961719794
DArtagnan was known to this valetdechambre who was no other than Bernouin and he had during the last six or eight months introduced the Gascon a dozen times to the cardinal	94.90084963006358
The Gascon therefore instead of answering growled out Ja Ja in the most German and the least Gascon accent possible	737.6911002740436
As for Porthos on whom DArtagnan had impressed the necessity of absolute silence and who did not even now begin to comprehend the scheme of his friend which was to follow Mazarin in his visit to Athos he was simply mute	161.68723047385865
All that he was allowed to say in case of emergencies was the proverbial Der Teufel	818.4953434926553
Bernouin shut the door and went away	129.3749178492094
When Porthos heard the key turn in the lock he began to be alarmed lest they should only have exchanged one prison for another	113.92205721438263
Porthos my friend said DArtagnan do nt distrust Providence Let me meditate and consider	667.0293548111532
Meditate and consider as much as you like replied Porthos who was now quite out of humor at seeing things take this turn	205.2053428695487
We have walked eight paces whispered DArtagnan and gone up six steps so hereabouts is the pavilion called the pavilion of the orangery	434.53109763330616
The Comte de la Fere can not be far off only the doors are locked	172.88277007849186
That is a slight difficulty said Porthos and a good push with the shoulders	146.403969582851
For Gods sake Porthos my friend reserve your feats of strength or they will not have when needed the honor they deserve	229.47124011810217
Have you not heard that some one is coming here	83.66113640083508
Well that some one will open the doors	87.83051497065622
But my dear fellow if that some one recognizes us if that some one cries out we are lost for you do nt propose I imagine that I shall kill that man of the church	137.08792601269096
That might do if we were dealing with Englishmen or Germans	2033.8997986766353
Oh may God keep me from it and you too said DArtagnan	94.75592817367755
The young king would perhaps show us some gratitude but the queen would never forgive us and it is she whom we have to consider	115.18758562204975
And then besides the useless blood never no never I have my plan let me carry it out and we shall laugh	170.27533566551273
So much the better said Porthos I feel some need of it	136.0389235176313
Hush said DArtagnan the some one is coming	142.54134226741817
The sound of a light step was heard in the vestibule	74.71317801184077
The hinges of the door creaked and a man appeared in the dress of a cavalier wrapped in a brown cloak with a lantern in one hand and a large beaver hat pulled down over his eyes	60.37013461275538
Porthos effaced himself against the wall but he could not render himself invisible and the man in the cloak said to him giving him his lantern	68.83832179380195
Light the lamp which hangs from the ceiling	20.509069616855978
You know the watchword he said	3.4490102177852338
Ja replied the Gascon determined to confine himself to this specimen of the German tongue	176.5094413057956
Tedesco answered the cavalier va bene	8661.950553489189
And advancing toward the door opposite to that by which he came in he opened it and disappeared behind it shutting it as he went	87.97800045686195
Now asked Porthos what are we to do	40.8545938110829
Now we shall make use of your shoulder friend Porthos if this door proves to be locked	446.39269015990664
Everything in its proper time and all comes right to those who know how to wait patiently	160.54169751143328
But first barricade the first door well then we will follow yonder cavalier	723.9303961109855
The two friends set to work and crowded the space before the door with all the furniture in the room as not only to make the passage impassable but so to block the door that by no means could it open inward	156.80580786942318
There said DArtagnan we ca nt be overtaken	60.321199709495744
At first on arriving at the door through which Mazarin had passed DArtagnan tried in vain to open it but on the powerful shoulder of Porthos being applied to one of the panels which gave way DArtagnan introduced the point of his sword between the bolt and the staple of the lock	104.34088003498067
The bolt gave way and the door opened	11.519822262921082
As I told you everything can be attained Porthos women and doors by proceeding with gentleness	1524.8466779728797
You re a great moralist and that s the fact said Porthos	92.35784620513027
They entered behind a glass window by the light of the cardinals lantern which had been placed on the floor in the midst of the gallery they saw the orange and pomegranate trees of the Castle of Rueil in long lines forming one great alley and two smaller side alleys	144.133102372373
No cardinal said DArtagnan but only his lantern where the devil then is he	231.65544583090067
Exploring however one of the side wings of the gallery after making a sign to Porthos to explore the other he saw all at once at his left a tub containing an orange tree which had been pushed out of its place and in its place an open aperture	122.91030699364707
Ten men would have found difficulty in moving that tub but by some mechanical contrivance it had turned with the flagstone on which it rested	705.2596801031875
DArtagnan as we have said perceived a hole in that place and in this hole the steps of a winding staircase	117.54296341280792
He called Porthos to look at it	18.303793013816104
Were our object money only he said we should be rich directly	190.39510259763222
Do nt you understand Porthos At the bottom of that staircase lies probably the cardinals treasury of which folk tell such wonders and we should only have to descend empty a chest shut the cardinal up in it double lock it go away carrying off as much gold as we could put back this orangetree over the place and no one in the world would ever ask us where our fortune came fromnot even the cardinal	316.13475708712474
It would be a happy hit for clowns to make but as it seems to be unworthy of two gentlemen said Porthos	241.27454878743293
So I think and therefore I said Were our object money only but we want something else replied the Gascon	311.5987187356926
At the same moment whilst DArtagnan was leaning over the aperture to listen a metallic sound as if some one was moving a bag of gold struck on his ear he started instantly afterward a door opened and a light played upon the staircase	131.5687121236344
Mazarin had left his lamp in the gallery to make people believe that he was walking about but he had with him a waxlight to help him to explore his mysterious strong box	124.61590332208121
Faith he said in Italian as he was reascending the steps and looking at a bag of reals faith there s enough to pay five councillors of parliament and two generals in Paris	309.04437693571145
I am a great captainthat I am but I make war in my own way	44.06348321339033
The two friends were crouching down meantime behind a tub in the side alley	545.4016812284063
Mazarin came within three steps of DArtagnan and pushed a spring in the wall the slab turned and the orange tree resumed its place	259.98110242541446
Then the cardinal put out the waxlight slipped it into his pocket and taking up the lantern Now he said for Monsieur de la Fere	91.27697864133384
Very good thought DArtagnan tis our road likewise we will go together	194.51753007427803
All three set off on their walk Mazarin taking the middle alley and the friends the side ones	648.2613949224481
The cardinal reached a second door without perceiving he was being followed the sand with which the alleys were covered deadened the sound of footsteps	183.3582383862361
He then turned to the left down a corridor which had escaped the attention of the two friends but as he opened the door he paused as if in thought	61.01507125995869
Ah Diavolo he exclaimed I forgot the recommendation of De Comminges who advised me to take a guard and place it at this door in order not to put myself at the mercy of that fourheaded combination of devils	144.8093418032228
And with a movement of impatience he turned to retrace his steps	129.5572101812506
Do not give yourself the trouble my lord said DArtagnan with his right foot forward his beaver in his hand a smile on his face we have followed your eminence step by step and here we are	74.18947907855117
And he made the same friendly salute as DArtagnan	5355.980630868
Mazarin gazed at each of them with an affrighted stare recognized them and let drop his lantern uttering a cry of terror	171.30667724630874
DArtagnan picked it up by good luck it had not been extinguished	99.8979089547694
Oh what imprudence my lord said DArtagnan tis not good to be about just here without a light	182.14210533823987
Your eminence might knock against something or fall into a hole	137.14286190812328
Monsieur dArtagnan muttered Mazarin unable to recover from his astonishment	52.46178431287306
Yes my lord it is I	30.24577047421715
I have the honor to present to you Monsieur du Vallon that excellent friend of mine in whom your eminence had the kindness to interest yourself formerly	176.3424023540968
And DArtagnan held the lamp before the merry face of Porthos who now began to comprehend the affair and be very proud of the whole undertaking	104.73313281695322
You were going to visit Monsieur de la Fere said DArtagnan	79.45780690009224
Do nt let us disarrange your eminence	176.55940946938622
Be so good as to show us the way and we will follow you	40.03783992246908
Mazarin was by degrees recovering his senses	80.77382311627713
Have you been long in the orangery he asked in a trembling voice remembering the visits he had been paying to his treasury	155.6298962997569
Porthos opened his mouth to reply DArtagnan made him a sign and his mouth remaining silent gradually closed	320.0568338401952
This moment come my lord said DArtagnan	162.24623377308868
His fears were now no longer for his hoard but for himself	126.67679732316105
A sort of smile played on his lips	10.315489242630639
Come he said you have me in a snare gentlemen	244.3666456453847
You wish to ask for liberty andI give it you	995.0246544392254
Oh my lord answered DArtagnan you are too good as to our liberty we have that we want to ask something else of you	54.99113592861657
You have your liberty repeated Mazarin in terror	2135.163086707409
Certainly and on the other hand my lord you have lost it and now in accordance with the law of war sir you must buy it back again	76.0875320658134
Mazarin felt a shiver run through hima chill even to his hearts core	666.1626837672421
His piercing look was fixed in vain on the satirical face of the Gascon and the unchanging countenance of Porthos	128.86508565042038
Both were in shadow and the Sybil of Cuma herself could not have read them	180.08175012280225
To purchase back my liberty said the cardinal	68.82746784391274
And how much will that cost me Monsieur dArtagnan	497.6964941810256
Zounds my lord I do nt know yet	55.62129942401522
We must ask the Comte de la Fere the question	16.812437693296356
Will your eminence deign to open the door which leads to the counts room and in ten minutes all will be settled	35.045475770909405
My lord said DArtagnan your eminence sees that we wish to act with all formality and due respect but I must warn you that we have no time to lose open the door then my lord and be so good as to remember once for all that on the slightest attempt to escape or the faintest cry for help our position being very critical indeed you must not be angry with us if we go to extremities	113.82765679368468
Be assured answered Mazarin that I shall attempt nothing I give you my word of honor	49.29880835473473
DArtagnan made a sign to Porthos to redouble his watchfulness then turning to Mazarin	590.6824839447496
Now my lord let us enter if you please	52.488465053375
Mazarin turned the lock of a double door on the threshold of which they found Athos ready to receive his illustrious guests according to the notice Comminges had given him	100.36861799560059
Your eminence he said might have dispensed with your attendants the honor bestowed on me is too great for me to be unmindful of it	119.5676834897077
And so my dear count said DArtagnan his eminence did nt actually insist on our attending him it is Du Vallon and I who have insisted and even in a manner somewhat impolite perhaps so great was our longing to see you	247.0209505478563
At that voice that mocking tone and that familiar gesture accenting voice and tone Athos made a bound of surprise	517.0623473294493
What means this asked the count	2.8906454228620477
It means replied Mazarin trying to smile and biting his lips in the attempt that our parts are changed and that instead of these gentlemen being my prisoners I am theirs but gentlemen I warn you unless you kill me your victory will be of very short duration people will come to the rescue	144.6233693416346
Ah my lord cried the Gascon do nt threaten tis a bad example	433.01189435925676
We are so good and gentle to your eminence	379.7883474465989
Come let us put aside all rancor and talk pleasantly	5411.110772260297
There s nothing I wish more replied Mazarin	2188.499730434786
But do nt think yourselves in a better position than you are	40.32103488394313
In ensnaring me you have fallen into the trap yourselves	484.54812836245213
How are you to get away from here remember the soldiers and sentinels who guard these doors	441.8394913337565
Now I am going to show you how sincere I am	153.699346236576
Good thought DArtagnan we must look about us he s going to play us a trick	243.4858524397731
I offered you your liberty continued the minister will you take it Before an hour has passed you will be discovered arrested obliged to kill me which would be a crime unworthy of loyal gentlemen like you	208.076554528064
And like every other reflection passing in a mind that entertained none but noble thoughts this feeling was expressed in his eyes	200.33660796119574
And therefore said DArtagnan to clip the hope which Athoss tacit adhesion had imparted to Mazarin we shall not proceed to that violence save in the last extremity	934.398292328962
If on the contrary resumed Mazarin you accept your liberty	528.7534781231877
Why you my lord might take it away from us in less than five minutes afterward and from my knowledge of you I believe you will so take it away from us	67.19258455291668
Noon the faith of a cardinal	8335.854139458343
My lord I never believe cardinals who are not priests	960.1922931013981
Well on the faith of a minister	113.48917452380351
You are no longer a minister my lord you are a prisoner	101.58276938250839
Then on the honor of a Mazarin as I am and ever shall be I hope said the cardinal	99.69929418329313
I have heard speak of a Mazarin who had not much religion when his oaths were in question	252.35386928264194
I fear he may have been an ancestor of your eminence	163.896136318375
Monsieur dArtagnan you are a great wit and I am really sorry to be on bad terms with you	56.26086005492731
My lord let us come to terms I ask nothing better	250.2179332040697
Very well said Mazarin if I place you in security in a manner evident palpable	274.574020547146
Ah that is another thing said Porthos	87.05227028776831
In the first place do you accept asked the cardinal	96.5743823784479
Unfold your plan my lord and we will see	35.863425710174624
Take notice that you are shut upcaptured	35038.580263195065
You well know my lord that there always remains to us a last resource	230.17474925223436
Listen he said at the end of yonder corridor is a door of which I have the key it leads into the park	95.39170164898218
Go and take this key with you you are active vigorous and you have arms	105.98515993625675
At a hundred steps on turning to the left you will find the wall of the park get over it and in three leaps you will be on the road and free	87.8646306411586
Ah by Jove my lord said DArtagnan you have well said but these are only words	115.76102764393308
Where is the key you speak of	37.617143238788245
Ah my lord You will conduct us yourself then to that door	393.5549681152355
Very willingly if it be necessary to reassure you answered the minister and Mazarin who was delighted to get off so cheaply led the way in high spirits to the corridor and opened the door	112.64036955096721
It led into the park as the three fugitives perceived by the night breeze which rushed into the corridor and blew the wind into their faces	128.1476707394013
The devil exclaimed the Gascon tis a dreadful night my lord	174.8147021723612
We do nt know the locality and shall never find the wall	297.08280505923756
Since your eminence has come so far come a few steps further conduct us my lord to the wall	212.76803481695808
Be it so replied the cardinal and walking in a straight line he went to the wall at the foot of which they all four arrived at the same instant	65.03573382804572
Are you satisfied gentlemen asked Mazarin	9476.040101583463
I think so indeed we should be hard to please if we were not	82.52309680133716
Deuce take it three poor gentlemen escorted by a prince of the church Ah apropos my lord you remarked that we were all active vigorous and armed	315.1015781628152
Monsieur du Vallon and I are the only two who are armed	315.9426591387858
The count is not and should we meet with one of your patrol we must defend ourselves	174.50081440504422
Where can we find another sword asked Porthos	1686.7687013144298
My lord said DArtagnan will lend his which is of no use to him to the Comte de la Fere	64.7288634032632
Willingly said the cardinal I will even ask the count to keep it for my sake	43.403622884213725
I promise you my lord never to part with it replied Athos	379.03152444881243
Well well cried DArtagnan this reconciliation is truly touching have you not tears in your eyes Porthos	382.1648124526887
Yes said Porthos but I do not know if it is feeling or the wind that makes me weep I think it is the wind	58.2481198760439
Now climb up Athos quickly said DArtagnan	343.8582509499967
Athos assisted by Porthos who lifted him up like a feather arrived at the top	88.30124617572432
Athos jumped and disappeared on the other side of the wall	7.094748588704977
Are you on the ground asked DArtagnan	229.45202798499625
Porthos whilst I get up watch the cardinal	1123.949032577106
No I do nt want your help watch the cardinal	277.7031332628402
You are right it is more difficult than I thought	29.47180118584985
Lend me your backbut do nt let the cardinal go	172.073966681258
Porthos lent him his back and DArtagnan was soon on the summit of the wall where he seated himself	49.02549591906693
Now give me the cardinal up here if he makes any noise stifle him	211.80174877617404
Mazarin wished to call out but Porthos held him tight and passed him to DArtagnan who seized him by the neck and made him sit down by him then in a menacing tone he said	82.67262503725634
Sir jump directly down close to Monsieur de la Fere or on the honor of a gentleman Ill kill you	55.40242858811091
Monsieur monsieur cried Mazarin you are breaking your word to me	41.147815298256894
Idid I promise you anything my lord	78.00496065361042
You are free he said through me your liberty was my ransom	409.6782124362918
Agreed but the ransom of that immense treasure buried under the gallery to which one descends on pushing a spring hidden in the wall which causes a tub to turn revealing a staircasemust not one speak of that a little my lord	392.3601665800724
Diavolo cried Mazarin almost choked and clasping his hands I am a lost and ruined man	75.67514847218071
But without listening to his protestations of alarm DArtagnan slipped him gently down into the arms of Athos who stood immovable at the bottom of the wall	120.48853351565202
Porthos next made an effort which shook the solid wall and by the aid of his friends hand gained the summit	162.44100435333536
I did nt understand it all he said but I understand now how droll it is	74.54596387332401
You think so so much the better but that it may prove laughterworthy even to the end let us not lose time	163.5485197928867
And he jumped off the wall	117.27611779376033
Attend to monsieur le cardinal gentlemen said DArtagnan for myself I will reconnoitre	285.91881181749113
The Gascon then drew his sword and marched as avant guard	1607.4008108228998
My lord he said which way do we go Think well of your reply for should your eminence be mistaken there might ensue most grave results for all of us	536.7554155590523
Along the wall sir said Mazarin there will be no danger of losing yourselves	304.28447389921496
The three friends hastened on but in a short time were obliged to slacken the pace	174.12110644683204
The cardinal could not keep up with them though with every wish to do so	55.0461118119114
Suddenly DArtagnan touched something warm which moved	2470.5380698441672
Stop a horse he cried I have found a horse	49.41201414229272
I too said Porthos who faithful to the instructions still held the cardinals arm	344.2150448172804
There s luck my lord just as you were complaining of being tired and obliged to walk	180.22229183062979
But as he spoke the barrel of a pistol was presented at his breast and these words were pronounced	92.35149842188308
Grimaud he cried Grimaud what art thou about Why thou art posted here by Heaven	364.23060216725963
No sir said the honest servant it was Monsieur Aramis who posted me here to take care of the horses	131.1729518816165
Yes sir he has been here since yesterday	140.22329448177055
At the lesser gate of the castle he s posted there	427.7171289746454
And believing that no one could execute the commission better than himself Grimaud set off at full speed whilst enchanted at being all together again the friends awaited his return	367.09539741574906
There was no one in the whole group in a bad humor except Cardinal Mazarin	409.88512475389746
Thinking that Porthos will be at last a Baron and DArtagnan a Captain	283.5531474389615
At the expiration of ten minutes Aramis arrived accompanied by Grimaud and eight or ten followers	475.4492923950843
He was excessively delighted and threw himself into his friends arms	57.8781738582922
You are free my brothers free without my aid and I shall have succeeded in doing nothing for you in spite of all my efforts	63.57707208748988
Do not be unhappy dear friend on that account if you have done nothing as yet you will do something soon replied Athos	111.29208926233825
I had well concerted my plans pursued Aramis the coadjutor gave me sixty men twenty guard the walls of the park twenty the road from Rueil to Saint Germain twenty are dispersed in the woods	404.5684087454671
Thus I was able thanks to the strategic disposition of my forces to intercept two couriers from Mazarin to the queen	378.43530744566175
But said DArtagnan I trust that you honorably sent them back to monsieur le cardinal	187.91919105455588
Ah yes said Aramis toward him I should be very likely to practice such delicacy of sentiment In one of the despatches the cardinal declares to the queen that the treasury is empty and that her majesty has no more money	146.40655551602768
In the other he announces that he is about to transport his prisoners to Melun since Rueil seemed to him not sufficiently secure	319.2343698977539
You can understand dear friend with what hope I was inspired by that last letter	92.37612289639665
I placed myself in ambuscade with my sixty men I encircled the castle the riding horses I entrusted to Grimaud and I awaited your coming out which I did not expect till tomorrow and I did nt hope to free you without a skirmish	183.19618814375397
You are free tonight without fighting so much the better How did you manage to escape that scoundrel Mazarin You must have much reason to complain of him	160.39678568653227
I might even say that we have some reason to praise him	85.38239169203891
Yes really it is owing to him that we are free	34.266418410124366
Yes he had us conducted into the orangery by Monsieur Bernouin his valetdechambre and from there we followed him to visit the Comte de la Fere	191.5731520521803
Then he offered us our liberty and we accepted it	73.72735432119508
He even went so far as to show us the way out he led us to the park wall which we climbed over without accident and then we fell in with Grimaud	171.96578686312964
Well exclaimed Aramis this will reconcile me to him but I wish he were here that I might tell him that I did not believe him capable of so noble an act	55.44810450638611
My lord said DArtagnan no longer able to contain himself allow me to introduce to you the Chevalier dHerblay who wishesas you may have heardto offer his congratulations to your eminence	206.09525996885435
And he retired discovering Mazarin who was in great confusion to the astonished gaze of Aramis	104.13304524515137
Ho ho exclaimed the latter the cardinal a glorious prize Halloo halloo friends to horse to horse	2722.981064395574
Several horsemen ran quickly to him	44.69190056259138
Zounds cried Aramis I may have done some good so my lord deign to receive my most respectful homage I will lay a wager that twas that Saint Christopher Porthos who performed this feat Apropos I forgot and he gave some orders in a low voice to one of the horsemen	227.41908725423605
I think it will be wise to set off said DArtagnan	212.00713173651292
Yes but I am expecting some one a friend of Athos	350.4283178156701
And here he comes by Jupiter galloping through the bushes	1135.3590869627405
The count the count cried a young voice that made Athos start	373.39309569710974
For one moment the young man forgot his habitual respecthe threw himself on his fathers neck	129.63060360450694
Look my lord cardinal said Aramis would it not have been a pity to have separated men who love each other as we love Gentlemen he continued addressing the cavaliers who became more and more numerous every instant gentlemen encircle his eminence that you may show him the greater honor	208.83522489946282
He will indeed give us the favor of his company you will I hope be grateful for it Porthos do not lose sight of his eminence	83.10584832663824
Aramis then joined Athos and DArtagnan who were consulting together	517.9122528713888
Come said DArtagnan after a conference of five minutes duration let us begin our journey	190.28824398024977
Where are we to go asked Porthos	601.8961084995016
To your house dear Porthos at Pierrefonds your fine chateau is worthy of affording its princely hospitality to his eminence it is likewise well situatedneither too near Paris nor too far from it we can establish a communication between it and the capital with great facility	410.5579906500441
Come my lord you shall be treated like a prince as you are	44.43915344662384
A fallen prince exclaimed Mazarin piteously	395461.1558500082
The chances of war said Athos are many but be assured we shall take no improper advantage of them	209.31455760641958
No but we shall make use of them said DArtagnan	37.36035709590283
The rest of the night was employed by these cavaliers in traveling with the wonderful rapidity of former days	186.31929316552592
Mazarin still sombre and pensive permitted himself to be dragged along in this way it looked a race of phantoms	243.1871802316443
At dawn twelve leagues had been passed without drawing rein half the escort were exhausted and several horses fell down	460.5070150262594
Horses nowadays are not what they were formerly observed Porthos everything degenerates	1663.5075595272895
I have sent Grimaud to Dammartin said Aramis	2345.489628225084
He is to bring us five fresh horsesone for his eminence four for us	753.4218614985946
We at least must keep close to monseigneur the rest of the start will rejoin us later	241.82997881378762
Once beyond Saint Denis we shall have nothing to fear	22.542630512302765
Grimaud in fact brought back five horses	162.20774923410698
The nobleman to whom he applied being a friend of Porthos was very ready not to sell them as was proposed but to lend them	205.24127201405722
Ten minutes later the escort stopped at Ermenonville but the four friends went on with well sustained ardor guarding Mazarin carefully	931.4235398208269
At noon they rode into the avenue of Pierrefonds	36.01245694814369
Ah said Mousqueton who had ridden by the side of DArtagnan without speaking a word on the journey you may think what you will sir but I can breathe now for the first time since my departure from Pierrefonds and he put his horse to a gallop to announce to the other servants the arrival of Monsieur du Vallon and his friends	79.3575797904901
We are four of us said DArtagnan we must relieve each other in mounting guard over my lord and each of us must watch three hours at a time	223.8963325593993
Athos is going to examine the castle which it will be necessary to render impregnable in case of siege Porthos will see to the provisions and Aramis to the troops of the garrison	198.97670735291373
That is to say Athos will be chief engineer Porthos purveyoringeneral and Aramis governor of the fortress	1568.6202195514031
Meanwhile they gave up to Mazarin the handsomest room in the chateau	393.25617013087583
Gentlemen he said when he was in his room you do not expect I presume to keep me here a long time incognito	71.72244117478509
No my lord replied the Gascon on the contrary we think of announcing very soon that we have you here	123.65917217178324
Were the late Cardinal Richelieu alive he would tell you a certain story of the Bastion Saint Gervais which we four with our four lackeys and twelve dead men held out against a whole army	229.99463628535736
Such feats sir are done onceand never repeated	5295.988705438351
However nowadays there s no need of so much heroism	216.35067303869573
Tomorrow the army of Paris will be summoned the day after it will be here The field of battle instead therefore of being at Saint Denis or at Charenton will be near Compiegne or VillarsCotterets	224.43205047857836
The prince will vanquish you as he has always done	42.85273785658836
Tis possible my lord but before an engagement ensues we shall move your eminence to another castle belonging to our friend Du Vallon who has three	271.07160213732925
We will not expose your eminence to the chances of war	86.3562687305598
Come answered Mazarin I see it will be necessary for me to capitulate	74.81675260229557
Yes the conditions will be better than afterward	450.17349296062366
Ah my lord as to conditions you would soon see how moderate and reasonable we are	437.53042237374785
Come now what are your conditions	833.8334545155101
Rest yourself first my lord and wewe will reflect	556.6694048833274
I do not need rest gentlemen I need to know whether I am among enemies or friends	157.37513246398964
Well then tell me at once what you want that I may see if any arrangement be possible	109.24027526543178
My lord replied Athos for myself I have nothing to demand	28.46377246132198
For France were I to specify my wishes I should have too much	82.45245458596146
I beg you to excuse me and propose to the chevalier	94.56186142697656
And Athos bowing retired and remained leaning against the mantelpiece a spectator of the scene	195.72075217487907
Speak then chevalier said the cardinal	1340.7724301766978
What do you want Nothing ambiguous if you please	190.6593666847801
As for me replied Aramis I have in my pocket the very programme of the conditions which the deputationof which I formed onewent yesterday to Saint Germain to impose on you	174.89619172426927
Let us consider first the ancient rights	16302.648388354326
The demands in that programme must be granted	162.59429147988934
We were almost agreed on those replied Mazarin let us pass on to private and personal stipulations	795.5159916272574
You suppose then that there are some said Aramis smiling	121.47518889767485
I do not suppose that you will all be quite so disinterested as Monsieur de la Fere replied the cardinal bowing to Athos	179.98914346703418
My lord you are right and I am glad to see that you do justice to the count at last	34.87258413276974
The count has a mind above vulgar desires and earthly passions	4545.745060765856
He is a proud soulhe is a man by himself You are righthe is worth us all and we avow it to you	238.98320775796836
Aramis said Athos are you jesting	219197.94211749543
No no dear friend I state only what we all know	1314.1567480538847
You are right it is not you alone this matter concerns but my lord and his unworthy servant myself	290.19739525448335
Well then what do you require besides the general conditions before recited	1355.713601028733
I require my lord that Normandy should be given to Madame de Longueville with five hundred thousand francs and full absolution	91.90028423781828
I require that his majesty should deign to be godfather to the child she has just borne and that my lord after having been present at the christening should go to proffer his homage to our Holy Father the Pope	289.0969616020596
That is you wish me to lay aside my ministerial functions to quit France and be an exile	271.117510551542
I wish his eminence to become pope on the first opportunity allowing me then the right of demanding full indulgences for myself and my friends	302.0773634882827
Mazarin made a grimace which was quite indescribable and then turned to DArtagnan	158.2739447475841
I my lord answered the Gascon I differ from Monsieur dHerblay entirely as to the last point though I agree with him on the first	240.5685147515332
Far from wishing my lord to quit Paris I hope he will stay there and continue to be prime minister as he is a great statesman	186.5882538431421
I shall try also to help him to down the Fronde but on one conditionthat he sometimes remembers the kings faithful servants and gives the first vacant company of musketeers to a man that I could name	350.8080003257132
Yes you sir Speak if you please said Mazarin	48.4277232750559
As for me answered Porthos I wish my lord cardinal in order to do honor to my house which gives him an asylum would in remembrance of this adventure erect my estate into a barony with a promise to confer that order on one of my particular friends whenever his majesty next creates peers	267.9896424874629
You know sir that before receiving the order one must submit proofs	1480.2755049604427
Besides should it be necessary monseigneur will show him how that formality may be avoided	598.3701984333469
Mazarin bit his lips the blow was direct and he replied rather dryly	427.64053507925786
All this appears to me to be ill conceived disjointed gentlemen for if I satisfy some I shall displease others	656.2980967437211
If I stay in Paris I can not go to Rome if I became pope I could not continue to be prime minister and it is only by continuing prime minister that I can make Monsieur dArtagnan a captain and Monsieur du Vallon a baron	156.26165271512954
True said Aramis so as I am in a minority I withdraw my proposition so far as it relates to the voyage to Rome and monseigneurs resignation	233.6192011654873
I am to remain minister then said Mazarin	218.7246706154082
You remain minister that is understood said DArtagnan France needs you	2410.727108181478
And I desist from my pretensions said Aramis	1454.9821880008008
His eminence will continue to be prime minister and her majestys favorite if he will grant to me and my friends what we demand for France and for ourselves	199.72353953051706
Occupy yourselves with your own affairs gentlemen and let France settle matters as she will with me resumed Mazarin	689.9217217012629
The Frondeurs will have a treaty and your eminence must sign it before us promising at the same time to obtain the queens consent to it	156.10890098296514
I can answer only for myself said Mazarin	118.17807034142736
I can not answer for the queen	137.15449722873515
Oh said DArtagnan monseigneur knows very well that her majesty refuses him nothing	360.3564437805264
Here monseigneur said Aramis is the treaty proposed by the deputation of Frondeurs	307.21381773964174
Will your eminence please read and examine	415.043368253449
Reflect gentlemen that a signature given under circumstances like the present might be regarded as extorted by violence	456.09559438041356
Monseigneur will be at hand to testify that it was freely given	231.38739838039623
Then said DArtagnan your eminence must expect the consequences of a refusal	135.93653194905303
Would you dare to touch a cardinal	648.7115097876355
You have dared my lord to imprison her majestys musketeers	2075.6220611095823
The queen will revenge me gentlemen	5677.3421563684315
I do not think so although inclination might lead her to do so but we shall take your eminence to Paris and the Parisians will defend us	93.3727517609084
How uneasy they must be at this moment at Rueil and Saint Germain said Aramis	125.31122139101825
How they must be asking Where is the cardinal What has become of the minister Where has the favorite gone How they must be looking for monseigneur in all corners What comments must be made and if the Fronde knows that monseigneur has disappeared how the Fronde must triumph	403.5297478232698
Sign the treaty then monseigneur said Aramis	382.2767486695437
Suppose the queen should refuse to ratify it	211.8844910147493
Ah nonsense cried DArtagnan I can manage so that her majesty will receive me well I know an excellent method	180.68746180055305
I shall take her majesty the letter in which you tell her that the finances are exhausted	160.981131985921
And then asked Mazarin turning pale	4.476424371572308
When I see her majesty embarrassed I shall conduct her to Rueil make her enter the orangery and show her a certain spring which turns a box	304.32644399212745
Enough sir muttered the cardinal you have said enough where is the treaty	101.75749767106765
Sign my lord and he gave him a pen	48.081850504989596
Mazarin arose walked some moments thoughtful but not dejected	1050.821089394888
And when I have signed he said what is to be my guarantee	165.82721736717983
My word of honor sir said Athos	465.2579084567731
Mazarin started turned toward the Comte de la Fere and looking for an instant at that grand and honest countenance took the pen	97.49001146084352
It is sufficient count he said and signed the treaty	146.14909082432786
And now Monsieur dArtagnan he said prepare to set off for Saint Germain and take a letter from me to the queen	98.29002136827403
Shows how with Threat and Pen more is effected than by the Sword	317.50753919568336
DArtagnan knew his part well he was aware that opportunity has a forelock only for him who will take it and he was not a man to let it go by him without seizing it	119.24132862617721
He soon arranged a prompt and certain manner of traveling by sending relays of horses to Chantilly so that he might be in Paris in five or six hours	137.05076858197316
But before setting out he reflected that for a lad of intelligence and experience he was in a singular predicament since he was proceeding toward uncertainty and leaving certainty behind him	368.39594042618967
In fact he said as he was about to mount and start on his dangerous mission Athos for generosity is a hero of romance Porthos has an excellent disposition but is easily influenced Aramis has a hieroglyphic countenance always illegible	605.3617733811917
What will come out of those three elements when I am no longer present to combine them The deliverance of the cardinal perhaps	289.8799311655486
Now the deliverance of the cardinal would be the ruin of our hopes and our hopes are thus far the only recompense we have for labors in comparison with which those of Hercules were pygmean	277.7056776537288
You my dear Chevalier dHerblay he said are the Fronde incarnate	707.7564328433816
Mistrust Athos therefore who will not prosecute the affairs of any one even his own	142.06275155141233
Mistrust Porthos especially who to please the count whom he regards as God on earth will assist him in contriving Mazarins escape if Mazarin has the wit to weep or play the chivalric	386.6637809930501
Aramis smiled his smile was at once cunning and resolute	305.98267433519214
Fear nothing he said I have my conditions to impose	226.64426242377493
My private ambition tends only to the profit of him who has justice on his side	104.18061553122118
Good thought DArtagnan in this direction I am satisfied	71.22492696540122
He pressed Aramiss hand and went in search of Porthos	107.91974034902503
Friend he said you have worked so hard with me toward building up our fortune that at the moment when we are about to reap the fruits of our labours it would be a ridiculous piece of silliness in you to allow yourself to be controlled by Aramis whose cunning you knowa cunning which we may say between ourselves is not always without egotism or by Athos a noble and disinterested man but blase who desiring nothing further for himself does nt sympathize with the desires of others	311.2968059256285
What should you say if either of these two friends proposed to you to let Mazarin go	209.3585019246135
Why I should say that we had too much trouble in taking him to let him off so easily	97.55330545862415
Bravo Porthos and you would be right my friend for in losing him you would lose your barony which you have in your grasp to say nothing of the fact that were he once out of this Mazarin would have you hanged	123.20430232688572
Then I would kill him rather than let him go	59.483148231171135
There is no question you understand provided we secure our own interests of securing those of the Frondeurs who besides do nt understand political matters as we old soldiers do	396.24416200189927
Never fear dear friend said Porthos	4035.2558002994324
I shall see you through the window as you mount your horse I shall follow you with my eyes as long as you are in sight then I shall place myself at the cardinals doora door with glass windows	85.84558269523352
I shall see everything and at the least suspicious sign I shall begin to exterminate	387.4241599840001
Bravo thought DArtagnan on this side I think the cardinal will be well guarded	103.15317962129043
He pressed the hand of the lord of Pierrefonds and went in search of Athos	156.64983158817364
My dear Athos he said I am going away	35.28050030119831
I have only one thing to say to you	12.82056221899223
You know Anne of Austria the captivity of Mazarin alone guarantees my life if you let him go I am a dead man	123.80154185031584
I needed nothing less than that consideration my dear DArtagnan to persuade myself to adopt the role of jailer	246.47057146856596
I give you my word that you will find the cardinal where you leave him	55.313216960912015
This reassures me more than all the royal signatures thought DArtagnan	1405.0291154106496
Now that I have the word of Athos I can set out	105.69563597978873
DArtagnan started alone on his journey without other escort than his sword and with a simple passport from Mazarin to secure his admission to the queens presence	276.7641230360147
Six hours after he left Pierrefonds he was at Saint Germain	338.1073145888797
The disappearance of Mazarin was not as yet generally known	239.93855545542215
Anne of Austria was informed of it and concealed her uneasiness from every one	143.01576451702797
In the chamber of DArtagnan and Porthos the two soldiers had been found bound and gagged	232.98724223673273
On recovering the use of their limbs and tongues they could of course tell nothing but what they knewthat they had been seized stripped and bound	429.0649438806004
But as to what had been done by Porthos and DArtagnan afterward they were as ignorant as all the inhabitants of the chateau	146.66229861358175
Bernouin alone knew a little more than the others	30.177959901602744
Bernouin seeing that his master did not return and hearing the stroke of midnight had made an examination of the orangery	109.22543688774051
The first door barricaded with furniture had aroused in him certain suspicions but without communicating his suspicions to any one he had patiently worked his way into the midst of all that confusion	260.95913379020135
Then he came to the corridor all the doors of which he found open so too was the door of Athoss chamber and that of the park	100.30423411101894
From the latter point it was easy to follow tracks on the snow	171.10110441873138
He saw that these tracks tended toward the wall on the other side he found similar tracks then footprints of horses and then signs of a troop of cavalry which had moved away in the direction of Enghien	170.26553173376436
He could no longer cherish any doubt that the cardinal had been carried off by the three prisoners since the prisoners had disappeared at the same time and he had hastened to Saint Germain to warn the queen of that disappearance	69.21933066382643
Anne had enforced the utmost secrecy and had disclosed the event to no one except the Prince de Cond who had sent five or six hundred horsemen into the environs of Saint Germain with orders to bring in any suspicious person who was going away from Rueil in whatsoever direction it might be	105.721856251936
Now since DArtagnan did not constitute a body of horsemen since he was alone since he was not going away from Rueil and was going to Saint Germain no one paid any attention to him and his journey was not obstructed in any way	85.16418139992665
On entering the courtyard of the old chateau the first person seen by our ambassador was Maitre Bernouin in person who standing on the threshold awaited news of his vanished master	378.0989296366439
At the sight of DArtagnan who entered the courtyard on horseback Bernouin rubbed his eyes and thought he must be mistaken	97.59066974184293
But DArtagnan made a friendly sign to him with his head dismounted and throwing his bridle to a lackey who was passing he approached the valetdechambre with a smile on his lips	60.12360868079471
Monsieur dArtagnan cried the latter like a man who has the nightmare and talks in his sleep Monsieur dArtagnan	156.03334799654706
And why have you come here	14.014999314167593
To bring news of Monsieur de Mazarinthe freshest news there is	540.0489332205173
What has become of him then	148.96234868553597
He is as well as you and I	14.85048283928943
Nothing bad has happened to him then	101.32784343730025
He felt the need of making a trip in the Ile de France and begged usthe Comte de la Fere and Monsieur du Vallonto accompany him	204.9104537019812
We were too devoted servants to refuse him a request of that sort	98.46571951330037
We set out last evening and here we are	59.27102312508872
His eminence had something to communicate to her majesty something secret and privatea mission that could be confided only to a sure manand so has sent me to Saint Germain	385.6233079109453
And therefore my dear Monsieur Bernouin if you wish to do what will be pleasing to your master announce to her majesty that I have come and tell her with what purpose	83.18235937426759
Whether he spoke seriously or in jest since it was evident that under existing circumstances DArtagnan was the only man who could relieve the queens uneasiness Bernouin went without hesitation to announce to her this strange embassy and as he had foreseen the queen gave orders to introduce Monsieur dArtagnan at once	264.44095403362985
DArtagnan approached the sovereign with every mark of profound respect and having fallen on his knees presented to her the cardinals letter	120.84610096004896
It was however merely a letter of introduction	50.679220250683784
The queen read it recognized the writing and since there were no details in it of what had occurred asked for particulars	153.22815723639886
DArtagnan related everything with that simple and ingenuous air which he knew how to assume on occasions	353.70944341407017
The queen as he went on looked at him with increasing astonishment	85.80488221624306
She could not comprehend how a man could conceive such an enterprise and still less how he could have the audacity to disclose it to her whose interest and almost duty it was to punish him	152.88995502850986
How sir she cried as DArtagnan finished you dare to tell me the details of your crimeto give me an account of your treason	178.10865010405047
Pardon madame but I think that either I have expressed myself badly or your majesty has imperfectly understood me	222.57308365354436
There is here no question of crime or treason	140.3426300328298
Monsieur de Mazarin held us in prison Monsieur du Vallon and myself because we could not believe that he had sent us to England to quietly look on while they cut off the head of Charles I	108.38632148764924
brotherinlaw of the late king your husband the consort of Madame Henrietta your sister and your guest and because we did all that we could do to save the life of the royal martyr	185.9369716219698
We were then convinced my friend and I that there was some error of which we were the victims and that an explanation was called for between his eminence and ourselves	140.41137880693375
Now that an explanation may bear fruit it is necessary that it should be quietly conducted far from noise and interruption	237.5306194978705
We have therefore taken away monsieur le cardinal to my friends chateau and there we have come to an understanding	183.335178320221
Well madame it proved to be as we had supposed there was a mistake	70.85011708473479
Monsieur de Mazarin had thought that we had rendered service to General Cromwell instead of King Charles which would have been a disgrace rebounding from us to him and from him to your majestya dishonor which would have tainted the royalty of your illustrious son	201.83245039187682
We were able to prove the contrary and that proof we are ready to give to your majesty calling in support of it the august widow weeping in the Louvre where your royal munificence has provided for her a home	271.9950398734155
That proof satisfied him so completely that as a sign of satisfaction he has sent me as your majesty may see to consider with you what reparation should be made to gentlemen unjustly treated and wrongfully persecuted	298.2877753143845
I listen to you and I wonder at you sir said the queen	84.69291446555063
In fact I have rarely seen such excess of impudence	640.4898697019347
Your majesty on your side said DArtagnan is as much mistaken as to our intentions as the Cardinal Mazarin has always been	141.70801214190507
You are in error sir answered the queen	188.33984001019095
I am so little mistaken that in ten minutes you shall be arrested and in an hour I shall set off at the head of my army to release my minister	58.46518115699603
I am sure your majesty will not commit such an act of imprudence first because it would be useless and would produce the most disastrous results	139.162810426042
Before he could be possibly set free the cardinal would be dead and indeed so convinced is he of this that he entreated me should I find your majesty disposed to act in this way to do all I could to induce you to change your resolution	176.37411668689964
Well then I will content myself with arresting you	224.37499865373863
Madame the possibility of my arrest has been foreseen and should I not have returned by tomorrow at a certain hour the next day the cardinal will be brought to Paris and delivered to the parliament	80.02035886096606
It is evident sir that your position has kept you out of relation to men and affairs otherwise you would know that since we left Paris monsieur le cardinal has returned thither five or six times that he has there met De Beaufort De Bouillon the coadjutor and DElbeuf and that not one of them had any desire to arrest him	135.79993691059917
Your pardon madame I know all that	48.508938515622795
And therefore my friends will conduct monsieur le cardinal neither to De Beaufort nor to De Bouillon nor to the coadjutor nor to DElbeuf	307.50953874652515
These gentlemen wage war on private account and in buying them up by granting them what they wished monsieur le cardinal has made a good bargain	175.91634082880847
He will be delivered to the parliament members of which can of course be bought but even Monsieur de Mazarin is not rich enough to buy the whole body	203.05336400076067
I think returned Anne of Austria fixing upon him a glance which in any womans face would have expressed disdain but in a queens spread terror to those she looked upon nay I perceive you dare to threaten the mother of your sovereign	231.94975914621114
Madame replied DArtagnan I threaten simply and solely because I am obliged to do so	96.98486583765201
Believe me madame as true a thing as it is that a heart beats in this bosoma heart devoted to youbelieve that you have been the idol of our lives that we have as you well knowgood Heavenrisked our lives twenty times for your majesty	234.1918898561363
Have you then madame no compassion for your servants who for twenty years have vegetated in obscurity without betraying in a single sigh the solemn and sacred secrets they have had the honor to share with you Look at me madameat me whom you accuse of speaking loud and threateningly	226.9495735444198
What am I A poor officer without fortune without protection without a future unless the eye of my queen which I have sought so long rests on me for a moment	142.92539858786412
Look at the Comte de la Fere a type of nobility a flower of chivalry	130.3483094192154
He has taken part against his queen or rather against her minister	131.36352297463236
He has not been unreasonably exacting it seems to me	92.76920537534161
Look at Monsieur du Vallon that faithful soul that arm of steel who for twenty years has awaited the word from your lips which will make him in rank what he is in sentiment and in courage	143.1493294303936
Consider in short your people who love you and who yet are famished who have no other wish than to bless you and who neverthelessno I am wrong your subjects madame will never curse you say one word to them and all will be endedpeace succeed war joy tears and happiness to misfortune	253.02484362622607
Anne of Austria looked with wonderment on the warlike countenance of DArtagnan which betrayed a singular expression of deep feeling	201.00443496650703
Why did you not say all this before you took action sir she said	175.71509979703382
Because madame it was necessary to prove to your majesty one thing of which you doubtedthat is that we still possess amongst us some valor and are worthy of some consideration at your hands	200.73734457726334
And that valor would shrink from no undertaking according to what I see	161.9201539779593
It has hesitated at nothing in the past why then should it be less daring in the future	158.7721602916564
Then in case of my refusal this valor should a struggle occur will even go the length of carrying me off in the midst of my court to deliver me into the hands of the Fronde as you propose to deliver my minister	148.682943289647
We have not thought about it yet madame answered DArtagnan with that Gascon effrontery which had in him the appearance of naivete but if we four had resolved upon it we should do it most certainly	314.3307412263798
I ought muttered Anne to herself by this time to remember that these men are giants	207.51184703246278
Alas madame exclaimed DArtagnan this proves to me that not till today has your majesty had a just idea of us	197.58612947895097
Perhaps said Anne but that idea if at last I have it	163.56511035604228
Your majesty will do us justice	40.24952335559307
In doing us justice you will no longer treat us as men of vulgar stamp	248.37064478223311
You will see in me an ambassador worthy of the high interests he is authorized to discuss with his sovereign	271.7315873427998
Anne of Austria cast her eyes upon the treaty that DArtagnan presented to her	94.06662375565355
I do not see here she said anything but general conditions the interests of the Prince de Conti or of the Ducs de Beaufort de Bouillon and dElbeuf and of the coadjutor are herein consulted but with regard to yours	234.18079883104764
We do ourselves justice madame even in assuming the high position that we have	146.74328417867648
We do not think ourselves worthy to stand near such great names	734.0846122756835
But you I presume have decided to assert your pretensions viva voce	2316.4894484268107
I believe you madame to be a great and powerful queen and that it will be unworthy of your power and greatness if you do not recompense the arms which will bring back his eminence to Saint Germain	106.74929166249014
It is my intention so to do come let us hear you	90.82517213117757
He who has negotiated these matters forgive me if I begin by speaking of myself but I must claim that importance which has been given to me not assumed by me he who has arranged matters for the return of the cardinal ought it appears to me in order that his reward may not be unworthy of your majesty to be made commandant of the guardsan appointment something like that of captain of the musketeers	118.47305800673695
Tis the appointment Monsieur de Trville held you ask of me	395.65680826819647
The place madame is vacant and although tis a year since Monsieur de Trville has left it it has not been filled	166.84459914206687
But it is one of the principal military appointments in the kings household	421.94096023796664
Monsieur de Trville was but a younger son of a simple Gascon family like me madame he occupied that post for twenty years	248.30961216560365
You have an answer ready for everything replied the queen and she took from her bureau a document which she filled up and signed	120.94055237813977
Undoubtedly madame said DArtagnan taking the document and bowing this is a noble reward but everything in the world is unstable and the man who happened to fall into disgrace with your majesty might lose this office tomorrow	139.26193448861468
What more do you want asked the queen coloring as she found that she had to deal with a mind as subtle as her own	105.02251607144483
A hundred thousand francs for this poor captain of musketeers to be paid whenever his services shall no longer be acceptable to your majesty	195.9998361357309
To think of the Parisians soliloquized DArtagnan offering only the other day by an edict of the parliament six hundred thousand francs to any man soever who would deliver up the cardinal to them dead or aliveif alive in order to hang him if dead to deny him the rites of Christian burial	388.8898265433741
Come said Anne tis reasonable since you only ask from a queen the sixth of what the parliament has proposed and she signed an order for a hundred thousand francs	105.27247478672984
Now then she said what next	3369.8497696150957
Madame my friend Du Vallon is rich and has therefore nothing in the way of fortune to desire but I think I remember that there was a question between him and Monsieur Mazarin as to making his estate a barony	102.86677429600839
Nay it must have been a promise	140.78236671337515
A country clown said Anne of Austria people will laugh	192.1488620509565
But I am sure of one thingthat those who laugh at him in his presence will never laugh a second time	259.31536144872496
said the queen she signed a patent	803.0196372547406
Now there remains the chevalier or the Abb dHerblay as your majesty pleases	203.2044086623752
Does he wish to be a bishop	1250.7800247626442
No madame something easier to grant	1265.3983127741765
It is that the king should deign to stand godfather to the son of Madame de Longueville	105.32119716737735
Monsieur de Longueville is of royal blood madame said DArtagnan	687.0309984338519
Yes said the queen but his son	102.19339585759371
His son madame must be since the husband of the sons mother is	162.06522207087076
And your friend has nothing more to ask for Madame de Longueville	44.813199414119175
No madame for I presume that the king standing godfather to him could do no less than present him with five hundred thousand francs giving his father also the government of Normandy	131.97249732832722
As to the government of Normandy replied the queen I think I can promise but with regard to the present the cardinal is always telling me there is no more money in the royal coffers	131.96720782574513
We shall search for some madame and I think we can find a little and if your majesty approves we will seek for some together	117.01412384281574
Have nt you then a fourth companion	585.2632402957098
Yes madame the Comte de la Fere	8.911962717562103
There is in the world then one man who having the power to ask asksnothing	164.2872771353751
There is the Comte de la Fere madame	45.36374960001099
The Comte de la Fere is not a man	23.22948828290774
The Comte de la Fere is a demigod	301.91568154017926
Has he not a son a young man a relative a nephew of whom Comminges spoke to me as being a brave boy and who with Monsieur de Chatillon brought the standards from Lens	210.57508965240007
He has as your majesty has said a ward who is called the Vicomte de Bragelonne	124.8045810309566
If that young man should be appointed to a regiment what would his guardian say	353.8914763271728
Yes if your majesty herself should beg him to accept	182.20438929177246
He must be indeed a strange man	123.15135124193755
Well we will reflect and perhaps we will beg him	130.30567190534146
There is one thing the queen has not signedher assent to the treaty	605.2771684477158
Of what use today I will sign it tomorrow	56.473608466770294
I can assure her majesty that if she does not sign today she will not have time to sign tomorrow	48.359054806395534
Consent then I beg you madame to write at the bottom of this schedule which has been drawn up by Mazarin as you see	82.09142947593129
I consent to ratify the treaty proposed by the Parisians	290.20489439101885
Anne was caught she could not draw backshe signed but scarcely had she done so when pride burst forth and she began to weep	301.0732015122336
DArtagnan started on seeing these tears	178.79232512100415
Since that period of history queens have shed tears like other women	1575.925251706684
The Gascon shook his head these tears from royalty melted his heart	692.5255910444869
Madame he said kneeling look upon the unhappy man at your feet	39.24531308517089
He begs you to believe that at a gesture of your majesty everything will be possible to him	87.63670827471125
He has faith in himself he has faith in his friends he wishes also to have faith in his queen	189.3877648315435
And in proof that he fears nothing that he counts on nothing he will restore Monsieur de Mazarin to your majesty without conditions	593.3081491162028
Behold madame here are the august signatures of your majestys hand if you think you are right in giving them to me you shall do so but from this very moment you are free from any obligation to keep them	79.36383291440247
And DArtagnan full of splendid pride and manly intrepidity placed in Annes hands in a bundle the papers that he had one by one won from her with so much difficulty	200.59815908991806
There are momentsfor if everything is not good everything in this world is not badin which the most rigid and the coldest soul is softened by the tears of strong emotion heartarraigning sentiment one of these momentary impulses actuated Anne	316.9350924284291
DArtagnan when he gave way to his own feelingswhich were in accordance with those of the queenhad accomplished more than the most astute diplomacy could have attempted	249.6996241748481
He was therefore instantly recompensed either for his address or for his sensibility whichever it might be termed	337.17821055332223
You were right sir said Anne	8237.544308539867
There are the acts signed I deliver them to you without compulsion	434.6283493060349
Go and bring me back the cardinal as soon as possible	44.821081256561726
Madame faltered DArtagnan tis twenty years agoI have a good memorysince I had the honor behind a piece of tapestry in the Hotel de Ville of kissing one of those lovely hands	122.17529233559786
There is the other replied the queen and that the left hand should not be less liberal than the right she drew from her finger a diamond similar to the one formerly given to him take and keep this ring in remembrance of me	114.69878727962754
Madame said DArtagnan rising I have only one thing more to wish which is that the next thing you ask from me shall bemy life	133.30372983336122
And with this conclusiona way peculiar to himselfhe rose and left the room	190.77057633677438
I never rightly understood those men said the queen as she watched him retiring from her presence and it is now too late for in a year the king will be of age	89.63353048009566
In twentyfour hours DArtagnan and Porthos conducted Mazarin to the queen and the one received his commission the other his patent of nobility	335.5071666108094
On the same day the Treaty of Paris was signed and it was everywhere announced that the cardinal had shut himself up for three days in order to draw it up with the greatest care	69.05293725368244
Here is what each of the parties concerned gained by that treaty	1011.4677031347934
Monsieur de Conti received Damvilliers and having made his proofs as general he succeeded in remaining a soldier instead of being made cardinal	364.62046748492895
Moreover something had been said of a marriage with Mazarins niece	466.35616038289385
The idea was welcomed by the prince to whom it was of little importance whom he married so long as he married some one	102.9358559906954
The Duc de Beaufort made his entrance at court receiving ample reparation for the wrongs he had suffered and all the honor due to his rank	161.77306655384348
Full pardon was accorded to those who had aided in his escape	72.11426398273984
He received also the office of admiral which had been held by his father the Duc de Vendome and an indemnity for his houses and castles demolished by the Parliament of Bretagne	176.01585917531625
The Duc de Bouillon received domains of a value equal to that of his principality of Sedan and the title of prince granted to him and to those belonging to his house	172.79394432986288
The Duc de Longueville gained the government of PontdelArche five hundred thousand francs for his wife and the honor of seeing her son held at the baptismal font by the young king and Henrietta of England	74.8620650324541
Aramis stipulated that Bazin should officiate at that ceremony and that Planchet should furnish the christening sugar plums	1987.1838514970186
The Duc dElbeuf obtained payment of certain sums due to his wife one hundred thousand francs for his eldest son and twentyfive thousand for each of the three others	59.2835627901421
They promised indeed to negotiate with the pope for a cardinals hat for him but he knew how little reliance should be placed on such promises made by the queen and Mazarin	152.41217428615434
Quite contrary to the lot of Monsieur de Conti unable to be cardinal he was obliged to remain a soldier	128.14566252781572
And therefore when all Paris was rejoicing in the expected return of the king appointed for the next day Gondy alone in the midst of the general happiness was dissatisfied he sent for the two men whom he was wo nt to summon when in especially bad humor	112.26322834274579
Those two men were the Count de Rochefort and the mendicant of Saint Eustache	178.61657348403256
They came with their usual promptness and the coadjutor spent with them a part of the night	193.77035270879864
Difficult for Kings to return to the Capitals of their Kingdoms	193.79386048458022
Whilst DArtagnan and Porthos were engaged in conducting the cardinal to Saint Germain Athos and Aramis returned to Paris	102.57802844525179
Each had his own particular visit to make	54.338922111508346
Aramis rushed to the Hotel de Ville where Madame de Longueville was sojourning	76.17723881807831
The duchess loudly lamented the announcement of peace	359.17272731099706
War had made her a queen peace brought her abdication	3620.605886268568
She declared that she would never assent to the treaty and that she wished eternal war	296.78584493089517
But when Aramis had presented that peace to her in a true lightthat is to say with all its advantages when he had pointed out to her in exchange for the precarious and contested royalty of Paris the viceroyalty of FontdelArche in other words of all Normandy when he had rung in her ears the five hundred thousand francs promised by the cardinal when he had dazzled her eyes with the honor bestowed on her by the king in holding her child at the baptismal font Madame de Longueville contended no longer except as is the custom with pretty women to contend and defended herself only to surrender at last	206.10417156951218
Aramis made a presence of believing in the reality of her opposition and was unwilling to deprive himself in his own view of the credit of her conversion	93.51724420020736
Madame he said you have wished to conquer the prince your brotherthat is to say the greatest captain of the age and when women of genius wish anything they always succeed in attaining it	259.5753559554407
You have succeeded the prince is beaten since he can no longer fight	261.525277657852
Now attach him to our party	1853.1001786588595
Withdraw him gently from the queen whom he does not like from Mazarin whom he despises	212.25284192004133
The Fronde is a comedy of which the first act only is played	152.42252269393435
Let us wait for a dnouementfor the day when the prince thanks to you shall have turned against the court	153.42298370709088
This Frondist duchess trusted so confidently to the power of her fine eyes that she could not doubt their influence even over Monsieur de Cond and the chronicles of the time aver that her confidence was justified	138.2848569388882
Athos on quitting Aramis went to Madame de Chevreuse	24.06141868474988
Here was another frondeuse to persuade and she was even less open to conviction than her younger rival	656.2907224624196
There had been no stipulation in her favor	35.09331782883326
Monsieur de Chevreuse had not been appointed governor of a province and if the queen should consent to be godmother it could be only of her grandson or granddaughter	225.58739479923284
At the first announcement of peace Madame de Chevreuse frowned and in spite of all the logic of Athos to show her that a prolonged war would have been impracticable contended in favor of hostilities	322.2884893429632
My fair friend said Athos allow me to tell you that everybody is tired of war	42.29993995153482
You will get yourself exiled as you did in the time of Louis XIII	60.674425007491976
Believe me we have passed the time of success in intrigue and your fine eyes are not destined to be eclipsed by regretting Paris where there will always be two queens as long as you are there	151.336294355456
Oh cried the duchess I can not make war alone but I can avenge myself on that ungrateful queen and most ambitious favoriteon the honor of a duchess I will avenge myself	183.16796925406229
Madame replied Athos do not injure the Vicomte de Bragelonnedo not ruin his prospects	848.6757714710656
Alas excuse my weakness There are moments when a man grows young again in his children	399.160591976243
The duchess smiled half tenderly half ironically	611.5482579235905
Count she said you are I fear gained over to the court	266.4163716997387
I suppose you have a blue ribbon in your pocket	125.631904363619
Yes madame I have that of the Garter which King Charles I	273.8131297104696
gave me some days before he died	75.99311166526695
Come I am growing an old woman said the duchess pensively	298.8148273155389
Athos took her hand and kissed it	30.27054551992103
She sighed as she looked at him	13.065409262298523
Count she said Bragelonne must be a charming place	62.65995776111261
You are a man of taste	4172.673740134678
She sighed again and leaned her charming head gracefully reclined on her hand still beautiful in form and color	596.1230704189877
Madame exclaimed Athos what were you saying just now about growing old Never have I seen you look so young so beautiful	215.6813651045966
Does Monsieur de Bragelonne remain in Paris she inquired	99.87723663814874
What think you of it inquired Athos	1303.8032730132593
Leave him with me replied the duchess	96.18910216749303
No madame if you have forgotten the history of Oedipus I at least remember it	168.94887324252775
Really sir you are delightful and I should like to spend a month at Bragelonne	90.88616631255816
Are you not afraid of making people envious of me duchess replied Athos	1900.9838569981644
No I shall go incognito count under the name of Marie Michon	234.46628079934666
But do not keep Raoul with you	15.049703782753447
He he is quite a child	66.75704389754615
And tis a child he loves	173.33956196323882
This singular passion for a child of seven may some day make him very unhappy	348.50102669058936
There is to be war in Flanders	480.8987723687474
And at his return you will send him to me	26.78167260004923
I will arm him against love	23111.38065731074
Alas madame exclaimed Athos today love is like warthe breastplate is becoming useless	1743.9999351887643
Raoul entered at this moment he came to announce that the solemn entrance of the king queen and her ministers was to take place on the ensuing day	81.82844324430691
The next day in fact at daybreak the court made preparations to quit Saint Germain	545.3415568701357
Meanwhile the queen every hour had been sending for DArtagnan	254.46847672422783
I hear she said that Paris is not quiet	262.32010546716276
I am afraid for the kings safety place yourself close to the coach door on the right	189.11236447927504
Reassure yourself madame I will answer for the kings safety	134.89273203843217
As he left the queens presence Bernouin summoned him to the cardinal	348.97753352924104
Sir said Mazarin to him an emeute is spoken of in Paris	319.92502511589356
I shall be on the kings left and as I am the chief person threatened remain at the coach door to the left	261.92987168937
Your eminence may be perfectly easy replied DArtagnan they will not touch a hair of your head	185.67588680354464
Deuce take it he thought to himself how can I take care of both Ah plague ont I will guard the king and Porthos shall guard the cardinal	318.84695886122574
The queen had confidence in the courage of DArtagnan which she knew and the cardinal in the strength of Porthos which he had experienced	101.75248249657561
The royal procession set out for Paris	30.519442172092912
Guitant and Comminges at the head of the guards marched first then came the royal carriage with DArtagnan on one side Porthos on the other then the musketeers for two and twenty years staunch friends of DArtagnan	245.48347627688733
During twenty he had been lieutenant their captain since the night before	551.4422816930703
The cortege proceeded to Notre Dame where a Te Deum was chanted	128.5286652673869
All Paris were in the streets	571.421097415321
The Swiss were drawn up along the road but as the road was long they were placed at six or eight feet distant from each other and one deep only	107.56523680328928
This force was therefore wholly insufficient and from time to time the line was broken through by the people and was formed again with difficulty	97.23129113994283
Whenever this occurred although it proceeded only from goodwill and a desire to see the king and queen Anne looked at DArtagnan anxiously	330.4821426285342
Mazarin who had dispensed a thousand louis to make the people cry Long live Mazarin and who had accordingly no confidence in acclamations bought at twenty pistoles each kept one eye on Porthos but that gigantic bodyguard replied to the look with his great bass voice Be tranquil my lord and Mazarin became more and more composed	428.82695669861073
At the Palais Royal the crowd which had flowed in from the adjacent street was still greater like an impetuous mob a wave of human beings came to meet the carriage and rolled tumultuously into the Rue Saint Honore	238.1785757234616
When the procession reached the palace loud cries of Long live their majesties resounded	812.7463500718673
Mazarin leaned out of the window	11.744366291314043
One or two shouts of Long live the cardinal saluted his shadow but instantly hisses and yells stifled them remorselessly	1104.3800895517018
Mazarin turned pale and shrank back in the coach	66.94405714766084
DArtagnan said nothing but twirled his mustache with a peculiar gesture which showed that his fine Gascon humor was awake	194.42408602377643
Anne of Austria bent down and whispered in the young kings ear	187.56862394085195
Say something gracious to Monsieur dArtagnan my son	297.3488403878193
The young king leaned toward the door	2.529280902395249
I have not said goodmorning to you Monsieur dArtagnan he said nevertheless I have remarked you	123.83524839957269
It was you who were behind my bedcurtains that night the Parisians wished to see me asleep	348.583424831349
And if the king permits me returned the Gascon I shall be near him always when there is danger to be encountered	154.05452578138275
Sir said Mazarin to Porthos what would you do if the crowd fell upon us	105.47649234650382
Kill as many as I could my lord	112.85176827864677
Hem brave as you are and strong as you are you could not kill them all	63.490949108507905
Tis true answered Porthos rising on his saddle in order that he might appraise the immense crowd there are a lot of them	138.0211594711257
I think I should like the other fellow better than this one said Mazarin to himself and he threw himself back in his carriage	82.69660350342095
The queen and her minister more especially the latter had reason to feel anxious	246.5131194961003
The crowd whilst preserving an appearance of respect and even of affection for the king and queen regent began to be tumultuous	234.15195063134783
Reports were whispered about like certain sounds which announce as they whistle from wave to wave the coming stormand when they pass athwart a multitude presage an emeute	1328.4840415604724
DArtagnan turned toward the musketeers and made a sign imperceptible to the crowd but very easily understood by that chosen regiment the flower of the army	127.5522342685708
The ranks closed firmly in and a kind of majestic tremor ran from man to man	377.15747994676417
At the Barriere des Sergents the procession was obliged to stop	66.11183205211934
Comminges left the head of the escort and went to the queens carriage	93.06419620883398
Anne questioned DArtagnan by a look	12.414280528828527
He answered in the same language	255.17017499692318
An effort was made and the living barrier was violently broken through	272.32760357325645
Some complaints arose from the crowd and were addressed this time to the king as well as the minister	83.27347903831439
Onward cried DArtagnan in a loud voice	8.002806366875715
But as if the multitude had waited only for this demonstration to burst out all the sentiments of hostility that possessed it exploded simultaneously	482.95046817756474
Cries of Down with Mazarin Death to the cardinal resounded on all sides	171.97353320732464
At the same time through the streets of Grenelle Saint Honore and Du Coq a double stream of people broke the feeble hedge of Swiss guards and came like a whirlwind even to the very legs of Porthoss horse and that of DArtagnan	320.73737115763834
This new eruption was more dangerous than the others being composed of armed men	101.51925214449497
It was plain that it was not the chance combination of those who had collected a number of the malcontents at the same spot but a concerted organized attack	147.2657269020253
Each of these mobs was led by a chief one of whom appeared to belong not to the people but to the honorable corporation of mendicants and the other notwithstanding his affected imitation of the people might easily be discerned to be a gentleman	198.41996552122075
Both were evidently stimulated by the same impulse	125.90955334766822
There was a shock which was perceived even in the royal carriage	196.27918371262123
Myriads of hoarse cries forming one vast uproar were heard mingled with guns firing	546.9073484781702
The escort divided into two files	15895.50883937836
One of them passed around to the right of the carriage the other to the left	33.17682863485684
One went to support DArtagnan the other Porthos	1064.7697106692658
Then came a skirmish the more terrible because it had no definite object the more melancholy because those engaged in it knew not for whom they were fighting	185.2576365906001
Like all popular movements the shock given by the rush of this mob was formidable	368.13433171479403
The musketeers few in number not being able in the midst of this crowd to make their horses wheel around began to give way	111.69617062028247
DArtagnan offered to lower the blinds of the royal carriage but the young king stretched out his arm saying	90.02474058130012
No sir I wish to see everything	73.33313794316736
If your majesty wishes to look outwell then look replied DArtagnan	4638.065695069935
And turning with that fury which made him so formidable he rushed toward the chief of the insurgents a man who with a huge sword in his hand was trying to hew a passage to the coach door through the musketeers	114.07532969260491
At these words the man with a pistol and sword raised his head but it was too late	33.25929007471256
The blow was sped by DArtagnan the rapier had pierced his bosom	609.8769137685474
Ah confound it cried the Gascon trying in vain too late to retract the thrust	238.43618877896648
What the devil are you doing here count	100.24509060743226
Accomplishing my destiny replied Rochefort falling on one knee	124.16199021246912
I have already got up again after three stabs from you I shall never rise after this fourth	244.06985570466156
Count said DArtagnan with some degree of emotion I struck without knowing that it was you	69.04483878884693
I am sorry if you die that you should die with sentiments of hatred toward me	148.22903620516584
Rochefort extended his hand to DArtagnan who took it	74.630036808462
The count wished to speak but a gush of blood stifled him	227.6268263285228
He stiffened in the last convulsions of death and expired	149.14570843281953
Back people cried DArtagnan your leader is dead you have no longer any business here	88.40964647681069
Indeed as if De Rochefort had been the very soul of the attack the crowd who had followed and obeyed him took to flight on seeing him fall	73.26326117167618
DArtagnan charged with a party of musketeers up the Rue du Coq and the portion of the mob he assailed disappeared like smoke dispersing near the Place Saint GermainlAuxerrois and taking the direction of the quays	256.0591081980903
DArtagnan returned to help Porthos if Porthos needed help but Porthos for his part had done his work as conscientiously as DArtagnan	625.0208319651293
The left of the carriage was as well cleared as the right and they drew up the blind of the window which Mazarin less heroic than the king had taken the precaution to lower	113.537102598515
What a devil of a face you have Porthos and what a strange air for a victor	294.82404694451384
But you answered Porthos seem to me agitated	36.21251137999165
There s a reason Zounds I have just killed an old friend	34.405292663033485
Well exactly like me I have just killed a man whose face is not unknown to me	55.26456740778162
Unluckily I hit him on the head and immediately his face was covered with blood	37.745138533422725
And he said nothing as he died	91.15903942814526
I suppose answered DArtagnan laughing if he only said that it did not enlighten you much	142.52011756407808
Madame the passage is quite clear and your majesty can continue your road	187.9659503667299
In fact the procession arrived in safety at Notre Dame at the front gate of which all the clergy with the coadjutor at their head awaited the king the queen and the minister for whose happy return they chanted a Te Deum	227.3496682538801
As the service was drawing to a close a boy entered the church in great excitement ran to the sacristy dressed himself quickly in the choir robes and cleaving thanks to that uniform the crowd that filled the temple approached Bazin who clad in his blue robe was standing gravely in his place at the entrance to the choir	204.2984305900987
Bazin felt some one pulling his sleeve	115.5194325117365
He lowered to earth his eyes beatifically raised to Heaven and recognized Friquet	783.9299479391854
Well you rascal what is it How do you dare to disturb me in the exercise of my functions asked the beadle	98.60322969351958
Monsieur Bazin said Friquet Monsieur Maillardyou know who he is he gives holy water at Saint Eustache	697.2935618163293
Well he received in the scrimmage a sword stroke on the head	485.18289141441403
That great giant who was there gave it to him	63.65561508709085
In that case said Bazin he must be pretty sick	292.22007091947535
So sick that he is dying and he wants to confess to the coadjutor who they say has power to remit great sins	378.13995639201784
And does he imagine that the coadjutor will put himself out for him	65.5280254926368
To be sure the coadjutor has promised	138.69327009520433
Certainly I was there when he fell	37.7858030238988
I was shouting Down with Mazarin Death to the cardinal The Italian to the gallows Is nt that what you would have me shout	264.40602466707486
Be quiet you rascal said Bazin looking uneasily around	238.0646950640443
So that he told me that poor Monsieur Maillard Go find the coadjutor Friquet and if you bring him to me you shall be my heir	181.14328559211197
Say then Father Bazinthe heir of Monsieur Maillard the giver of holy water at Saint Eustache Hey I shall have nothing to do but to fold my arms All the same I should like to do him that servicewhat do you say to it	191.35696558846502
I will tell the coadjutor said Bazin	935.9653752897362
In fact he slowly and respectfully approached the prelate and spoke to him privately a few words to which the latter responded by an affirmative sign	159.6306696560838
He then returned with the same slow step and said	88.22482969213594
Go and tell the dying man that he must be patient	46.309375894798364
Monseigneur will be with him in an hour	24.92928938750105
Good said Friquet my fortune is made	52.660945127550754
By the way said Bazin where was he carried	102.25264995970167
To the tower Saint Jacques la Boucherie and delighted with the success of his embassy Friquet started off at the top of his speed	167.10269267578025
When the Te Deum was over the coadjutor without stopping to change his priestly dress took his way toward that old tower which he knew so well	181.33592182064038
Though sinking from moment to moment the wounded man was not yet dead	119.64266067808734
The door was opened to the coadjutor of the room in which the mendicant was suffering	69.52631014962722
A moment later Friquet went out carrying in his hand a large leather bag he opened it as soon as he was outside the chamber and to his great astonishment found it full of gold	74.91052213809847
The mendicant had kept his word and made Friquet his heir	440.15202357434583
Ah Mother Nanette cried Friquet suffocating ah Mother Nanette	23813.903367405295
He could say no more but though he had nt strength to speak he had enough for action	152.95683112660862
He rushed headlong to the street and like the Greek from Marathon who fell in the square at Athens with his laurel in his hand Friquet reached Councillor Broussels threshold and then fell exhausted scattering on the floor the louis disgorged by his leather bag	489.86265080188963
Mother Nanette began by picking up the louis then she picked up Friquet	235.34497180256767
In the meantime the cortege returned to the Palais Royal	26.01621022205248
That Monsieur dArtagnan is a very brave man mother said the young king	116.18984345784824
Yes my son and he rendered very important services to your father	200.59188605556747
Treat him kindly therefore in the future	107.79362482164099
Captain said the young king to DArtagnan on descending from the carriage the queen has charged me to invite you to dinner todayyou and your friend the Baron du Vallon	226.12303831535206
That was a great honor for DArtagnan and for Porthos	546.1044922377287
Porthos was delighted and yet during the entire repast he seemed to be preoccupied	223.77212894091346
What was the matter with you baron DArtagnan said to him as they descended the staircase of the Palais Royal	116.71391868873731
You seemed at dinner to be anxious about something	277.82913219736446
I was trying said Porthos to recall where I had seen that mendicant whom I must have killed	117.44513994803657
Well search my friend search and when you have found you will tell me will you not	20.610204360127145
On going home the two friends found a letter from Athos who desired them to meet him at the Grand Charlemagne on the following day	78.66850350161066
The friends went to bed early but neither of them slept	1170.3853257633755
When we arrive at the summit of our wishes success has usually the power to drive away sleep on the first night after the fulfilment of long cherished hopes	276.8641289914585
The next day at the appointed hour they went to see Athos and found him and Aramis in traveling costume	173.69592865776985
What cried Porthos are we all going away then I also have made my preparations this morning	136.96912947078832
There s nothing to do in Paris now there s no Fronde	228.6704036620187
The Duchess de Longueville has invited me to pass a few days in Normandy and has deputed me while her son is being baptized to go and prepare her residence at Rouen after which if nothing new occurs I shall go and bury myself in my convent at NoisyleSec	193.45614423533357
And I said Athos am returning to Bragelonne	1576.175042397955
You know dear DArtagnan I am nothing more than a good honest country gentleman	114.06853954108806
Raoul has no fortune other than I possess poor child and I must take care of it for him since I only lend him my name	48.680870060071676
And Raoulwhat shall you do with him	20.33970306436232
I leave him with you my friend	23.725918088709367
War has broken out in Flanders	28660.882642503213
You shall take him with you there	39.537432519728995
I am afraid that remaining at Blois would be dangerous to his youthful mind	231.76953505806426
Take him and teach him to be as brave and loyal as you are yourself	83.21317766737984
Then replied DArtagnan though I shall not have you Athos at all events I shall have that dear fairhaired head by me and though he s but a boy yet since your soul lives again in him dear Athos I shall always fancy that you are near me sustaining and encouraging me	177.93835864029165
The four friends embraced with tears in their eyes	29.715570887284766
Then they departed without knowing whether they would ever see each other again	70.84631091851098
DArtagnan returned to the Rue Tiquetonne with Porthos still possessed by the wish to find out who the man was that he had killed	134.82517646927505
On arriving at the Hotel de la Chevrette they found the barons equipage all ready and Mousqueton on his saddle	175.36013436155892
Come DArtagnan said Porthos bid adieu to your sword and go with me to Pierrefonds to Bracieux or to Du Vallon	134.56681132739755
We will grow old together and talk of our companions	132.82277835835944
No replied DArtagnan deuce take it the campaign is going to begin I wish to be there I expect to get something by it	78.16166730184239
What do you expect to get	393.7512843218484
Why I expect to be made Marechal of France	794.9203875194795
Ha ha cried Porthos who was not completely taken in by DArtagnans Gasconades	633.846841238921
Come my brother go with me added DArtagnan and I will see that you are made a duke	74.22727131262519
No answered Porthos Mouston has no desire to fight besides they have erected a triumphal arch for me to enter my barony which will kill my neighbors with envy	282.8718219209606
To that I can say nothing returned DArtagnan who knew the vanity of the new baron	188.9284485356615
Then heres to our next merry meeting	8145.797003227042
Adieu dear captain said Porthos I shall always be happy to welcome you to my barony	82.52024088959571
Yes yes when the campaign is over replied the Gascon	108.9263944415226
His honors equipage is waiting said Mousqueton	512.1451709549901
The two friends after a cordial pressure of the hands separated	959.9083388599297
DArtagnan was standing at the door looking after Porthos with a mournful gaze when the baron after walking scarcely more than twenty paces returnedstood stillstruck his forehead with his finger and exclaimed	170.31456582831981
Who the beggar was that I killed	230.63138359806533
Ah indeed and who was he	232.25456078416224
And Porthos enchanted at having relieved his mind rejoined Mousqueton and they disappeared around an angle of the street	329.9761474081428
DArtagnan stood for an instant mute pensive and motionless then as he went in he saw the fair Madeleine his hostess standing on the threshold	169.19931216894477
Madeleine said the Gascon give me your apartment on the first floor now that I am a captain in the royal musketeers I must make an appearance nevertheless reserve my old room on the fifth story for me one never knows what may happen	144.5141583685232

On the 24th of February 1815 the lookout at NotreDame de la Garde signalled the threemaster the Pharaon from Smyrna Trieste and Naples	619.144463188836
As usual a pilot put off immediately and rounding the Chteau dIf got on board the vessel between Cape Morgiou and Rion island	562.8124796365805
Immediately and according to custom the ramparts of Fort SaintJean were covered with spectators it is always an event at Marseilles for a ship to come into port especially when this ship like the Pharaon has been built rigged and laden at the old Phocee docks and belongs to an owner of the city	326.7593700444709
The ship drew on and had safely passed the strait which some volcanic shock has made between the Calasareigne and Jaros islands had doubled Pomgue and approached the harbor under topsails jib and spanker but so slowly and sedately that the idlers with that instinct which is the forerunner of evil asked one another what misfortune could have happened on board	567.944992022476
However those experienced in navigation saw plainly that if any accident had occurred it was not to the vessel herself for she bore down with all the evidence of being skilfully handled the anchor acockbill the jibboom guys already eased off and standing by the side of the pilot who was steering the Pharaon towards the narrow entrance of the inner port was a young man who with activity and vigilant eye watched every motion of the ship and repeated each direction of the pilot	217.82676222219777
The vague disquietude which prevailed among the spectators had so much affected one of the crowd that he did not await the arrival of the vessel in harbor but jumping into a small skiff desired to be pulled alongside the Pharaon which he reached as she rounded into La Rserve basin	205.26506707994955
When the young man on board saw this person approach he left his station by the pilot and hat in hand leaned over the ships bulwarks	252.0997168499411
He was a fine tall slim young fellow of eighteen or twenty with black eyes and hair as dark as a ravens wing and his whole appearance bespoke that calmness and resolution peculiar to men accustomed from their cradle to contend with danger	346.46361171474064
Ah is it you Dants cried the man in the skiff	64.95125156764406
What s the matter and why have you such an air of sadness aboard	156.21428588185864
Morrel replied the young man a great misfortune for me especially Off Civita Vecchia we lost our brave Captain Leclere	1295.983653903901
And the cargo inquired the owner eagerly	3266.1470305158305
Morrel and I think you will be satisfied on that head	60.203152368476076
What happened to him asked the owner with an air of considerable resignation	40.51082717062696
What happened to the worthy captain	1774.2532186785693
No sir he died of brainfever in dreadful agony	2165.4556202258736
Then turning to the crew he said Bear a hand there to take in sail	572.1767332888224
All hands obeyed and at once the eight or ten seamen who composed the crew sprang to their respective stations at the spanker brails and outhaul topsail sheets and halyards the jib downhaul and the topsail clewlines and buntlines	614.7599216572897
The young sailor gave a look to see that his orders were promptly and accurately obeyed and then turned again to the owner	141.0285460574813
And how did this misfortune occur inquired the latter resuming the interrupted conversation	1099.4590003548306
Alas sir in the most unexpected manner	82.32058239164844
After a long talk with the harbormaster Captain Leclere left Naples greatly disturbed in mind	2039.3341273482781
In twentyfour hours he was attacked by a fever and died three days afterwards	64.30111769173214
We performed the usual burial service and he is at his rest sewn up in his hammock with a thirtysixpound shot at his head and his heels off El Giglio island	350.3004142987726
We bring to his widow his sword and cross of honor	265.003888094943
It was worth while truly added the young man with a melancholy smile to make war against the English for ten years and to die in his bed at last like everybody else	69.67616707978796
Why you see Edmond replied the owner who appeared more comforted at every moment we are all mortal and the old must make way for the young	127.59072209009713
If not why there would be no promotion and since you assure me that the cargo	121.18668669022101
Is all safe and sound M	263.74887650363496
Morrel take my word for it and I advise you not to take 25000 francs for the profits of the voyage	76.96931016917164
Then as they were just passing the Round Tower the young man shouted Stand by there to lower the topsails and jib brail up the spanker	863.6130290731738
The order was executed as promptly as it would have been on board a manofwar	62.839590533298455
Let goand clue up At this last command all the sails were lowered and the vessel moved almost imperceptibly onwards	474.13687752217675
Now if you will come on board M	211.94316644493426
Morrel said Dants observing the owners impatience here is your supercargo M	1161.7984155874622
Danglars coming out of his cabin who will furnish you with every particular	172.00808700471057
As for me I must look after the anchoring and dress the ship in mourning	504.508036751341
The owner did not wait for a second invitation	53.98110348677143
He seized a rope which Dants flung to him and with an activity that would have done credit to a sailor climbed up the side of the ship while the young man going to his task left the conversation to Danglars who now came towards the owner	79.25012343681584
He was a man of twentyfive or twentysix years of age of unprepossessing countenance obsequious to his superiors insolent to his subordinates and this in addition to his position as responsible agent on board which is always obnoxious to the sailors made him as much disliked by the crew as Edmond Dants was beloved by them	232.0408457206451
Morrel said Danglars you have heard of the misfortune that has befallen us	77.1962705323997
Yesyes poor Captain Leclere He was a brave and an honest man	86.23691616788285
And a firstrate seaman one who had seen long and honorable service as became a man charged with the interests of a house so important as that of Morrel   Son replied Danglars	117.85541990127513
But replied the owner glancing after Dants who was watching the anchoring of his vessel it seems to me that a sailor needs not be so old as you say Danglars to understand his business for our friend Edmond seems to understand it thoroughly and not to require instruction from anyone	136.63249867586885
Yes said Danglars darting at Edmond a look gleaming with hate	1946.2982876237543
Yes he is young and youth is invariably selfconfident	12938.145008648562
Scarcely was the captains breath out of his body when he assumed the command without consulting anyone and he caused us to lose a day and a half at the Island of Elba instead of making for Marseilles direct	141.91396719496348
As to taking command of the vessel replied Morrel that was his duty as captains mate as to losing a day and a half off the Island of Elba he was wrong unless the vessel needed repairs	229.4846361373482
The vessel was in as good condition as I am and as I hope you are M	44.434612014363246
Morrel and this day and a half was lost from pure whim for the pleasure of going ashore and nothing else	175.93520413184723
Dants said the shipowner turning towards the young man come this way	44.93439971975402
In a moment sir answered Dants and I m with you	158.63903426607405
Then calling to the crew he said Let go	101.79558831173078
The anchor was instantly dropped and the chain ran rattling through the porthole	477.28205081930076
Dants continued at his post in spite of the presence of the pilot until this manuvre was completed and then he added Halfmast the colors and square the yards	235.40710307309018
You see said Danglars he fancies himself captain already upon my word	570.6958214209222
And so in fact he is said the owner	83.02424303428133
Except your signature and your partners M	3241.910497199784
And why should he not have this asked the owner he is young it is true but he seems to me a thorough seaman and of full experience	260.27838774630226
A cloud passed over Danglars brow	336.35117085718525
Morrel said Dants approaching the vessel now rides at anchor and I am at your service	199.0293639248946
Danglars retreated a step or two	52.53472705508492
I wished to inquire why you stopped at the Island of Elba	38.30722718146349
I do not know sir it was to fulfil the last instructions of Captain Leclere who when dying gave me a packet for Marshal Bertrand	365.2495561161811
Then did you see him Edmond	2658.7479100369137
Morrel looked around him and then drawing Dants on one side he said suddenly	88.1802018146801
Very well as far as I could judge from the sight of him	30.905711334300147
He entered the marshals apartment while I was there	75.36893186677162
Why it was he who spoke to me sir said Dants with a smile	21.757129521386794
And what did he say to you	6.063925217254939
Asked me questions about the vessel the time she left Marseilles the course she had taken and what was her cargo	192.60420137667242
I believe if she had not been laden and I had been her master he would have bought her	95.38255689880363
But I told him I was only mate and that she belonged to the firm of Morrel   Son	143.07932734002947
Ah yes he said I know them	158.37493814928598
The Morrels have been shipowners from father to son and there was a Morrel who served in the same regiment with me when I was in garrison at Valence	111.44378390120885
Pardieu and that is true cried the owner greatly delighted	653.8785612318242
And that was Policar Morrel my uncle who was afterwards a captain	323.23219190664173
Dants you must tell my uncle that the emperor remembered him and you will see it will bring tears into the old soldiers eyes	134.79672918411157
Come come continued he patting Edmonds shoulder kindly you did very right Dants to follow Captain Lecleres instructions and touch at Elba although if it were known that you had conveyed a packet to the marshal and had conversed with the emperor it might bring you into trouble	381.556900912178
How could that bring me into trouble sir asked Dants for I did not even know of what I was the bearer and the emperor merely made such inquiries as he would of the first comer	104.30417995921935
But pardon me here are the health officers and the customs inspectors coming alongside	1912.0116183040936
And the young man went to the gangway	86.54085275168913
As he departed Danglars approached and said	135.31743791764978
Well it appears that he has given you satisfactory reasons for his landing at PortoFerrajo	310.41298445985706
Yes most satisfactory my dear Danglars	172.69671119739667
Well so much the better said the supercargo for it is not pleasant to think that a comrade has not done his duty	97.22896265800136
Dants has done his replied the owner and that is not saying much	110.5153921105788
It was Captain Leclere who gave orders for this delay	89.61560011241508
Talking of Captain Leclere has not Dants given you a letter from him	89.1343001656192
I believe that besides the packet Captain Leclere confided a letter to his care	845.5670382569044
Of what packet are you speaking Danglars	1049.2371477031836
Why that which Dants left at PortoFerrajo	512.6451903403189
How do you know he had a packet to leave at PortoFerrajo	210.35445387666775
I was passing close to the door of the captains cabin which was half open and I saw him give the packet and letter to Dants	103.32697136216017
He did not speak to me of it replied the shipowner but if there be any letter he will give it to me	48.35728707991917
Morrel I beg of you said he not to say a word to Dants on the subject	66.0556715681855
At this moment the young man returned Danglars withdrew	141.2524153947679
Well my dear Dants are you now free inquired the owner	126.30710571804491
You have not been long detained	136758.20193123101
I gave the customhouse officers a copy of our bill of lading and as to the other papers they sent a man off with the pilot to whom I gave them	98.4504681423624
Then you have nothing more to do here	33.935525710819185
Then you can come and dine with me	48.3414966325641
I really must ask you to excuse me M	32.258621978692624
My first visit is due to my father though I am not the less grateful for the honor you have done me	32.303456129848584
I always knew you were a good son	103.48605618171263
And inquired Dants with some hesitation do you know how my father is	23.458522809995873
Well I believe my dear Edmond though I have not seen him lately	60.9719455492355
Yes he likes to keep himself shut up in his little room	73.85904843727936
That proves at least that he has wanted for nothing during your absence	103.84978070032228
My father is proud sir and if he had not a meal left I doubt if he would have asked anything from anyone except from Heaven	118.87185418976375
Well then after this first visit has been made we shall count on you	60.75813584523312
I must again excuse myself M	952.8141059766334
Morrel for after this first visit has been paid I have another which I am most anxious to pay	67.31419822715557
True Dants I forgot that there was at the Catalans someone who expects you no less impatiently than your fatherthe lovely Mercds	315.3257202454214
Ah ha said the shipowner I am not in the least surprised for she has been to me three times inquiring if there were any news of the Pharaon	68.49202588348324
Peste Edmond you have a very handsome mistress	237.41417608286477
She is not my mistress replied the young sailor gravely she is my betrothed	190.3565117512655
Sometimes one and the same thing said Morrel with a smile	8.341130207813798
Not with us sir replied Dants	944.0613149681946
Well well my dear Edmond continued the owner do nt let me detain you	92.38690436356511
You have managed my affairs so well that I ought to allow you all the time you require for your own	35.92446555726382
No sir I have all my pay to takenearly three months wages	574.5078640868195
You are a careful fellow Edmond	276.75079574337127
Say I have a poor father sir	85.8471416953833
Yes yes I know how good a son you are so now hasten away to see your father	142.51976983954606
I have a son too and I should be very wroth with those who detained him from me after a three months voyage	205.66636773634357
Then I have your leave sir	222.6829128585922
Yes if you have nothing more to say to me	12.992702709714543
Captain Leclere did not before he died give you a letter for me	105.12098331561783
He was unable to write sir	1200.2644927778613
But that reminds me that I must ask your leave of absence for some days	56.40976966434162
Yes first and then to go to Paris	21.856453223053315
Very good have what time you require Dants	441.27724888542366
It will take quite six weeks to unload the cargo and we can not get you ready for sea until three months after that only be back again in three months for the Pharaon added the owner patting the young sailor on the back can not sail without her captain	186.05135767383769
Without her captain cried Dants his eyes sparkling with animation pray mind what you say for you are touching on the most secret wishes of my heart	88.97446333886407
Is it really your intention to make me captain of the Pharaon	38.26534159772363
If I were sole owner we d shake hands on it now my dear Dants and call it settled but I have a partner and you know the Italian proverbChi ha compagno ha padroneHe who has a partner has a master	293.89252363626946
But the thing is at least half done as you have one out of two votes	221.82267048410566
Rely on me to procure you the other I will do my best	33.95484037936349
Morrel exclaimed the young seaman with tears in his eyes and grasping the owners hand M	70.39788665116717
Morrel I thank you in the name of my father and of Mercds	22.221782458505437
There s a providence that watches over the deserving	1419.3142571988335
Go to your father go and see Mercds and afterwards come to me	102.09054290005426
No thank you I shall remain and look over the accounts with Danglars	219.93563275898558
Have you been satisfied with him this voyage	393.2936154704192
That is according to the sense you attach to the question sir	238.5182807156393
Do you mean is he a good comrade No for I think he never liked me since the day when I was silly enough after a little quarrel we had to propose to him to stop for ten minutes at the island of Monte Cristo to settle the disputea proposition which I was wrong to suggest and he quite right to refuse	150.58084611787703
If you mean as responsible agent when you ask me the question I believe there is nothing to say against him and that you will be content with the way in which he has performed his duty	55.72239093875835
But tell me Dants if you had command of the Pharaon should you be glad to see Danglars remain	121.77095501386235
Morrel I shall always have the greatest respect for those who possess the owners confidence	181.7829315640781
That s right that s right Dants I see you are a thoroughly good fellow and will detain you no longer	83.9636442256427
Go for I see how impatient you are	112.52376001350626
May I have the use of your skiff	135.62470622239027
Morrel farewell and a thousand thanks	2690.6964737464777
I hope soon to see you again my dear Edmond	45.58599464830152
The young sailor jumped into the skiff and sat down in the stern sheets with the order that he be put ashore at La Canebire	207.53658968439592
The two oarsmen bent to their work and the little boat glided away as rapidly as possible in the midst of the thousand vessels which choke up the narrow way which leads between the two rows of ships from the mouth of the harbor to the Quai dOrlans	110.99134828700389
The shipowner smiling followed him with his eyes until he saw him spring out on the quay and disappear in the midst of the throng which from five oclock in the morning until nine oclock at night swarms in the famous street of La Canebirea street of which the modern Phocens are so proud that they say with all the gravity in the world and with that accent which gives so much character to what is said If Paris had La Canebire Paris would be a second Marseilles	94.03799706339893
On turning round the owner saw Danglars behind him apparently awaiting orders but in reality also watching the young sailorbut there was a great difference in the expression of the two men who thus followed the movements of Edmond Dants	103.82813102678722
We will leave Danglars struggling with the demon of hatred and endeavoring to insinuate in the ear of the shipowner some evil suspicions against his comrade and follow Dants who after having traversed La Canebire took the Rue de Noailles and entering a small house on the left of the Alles de Meilhan rapidly ascended four flights of a dark staircase holding the baluster with one hand while with the other he repressed the beatings of his heart and paused before a halfopen door from which he could see the whole of a small room	104.7484133463254
This room was occupied by Dants father	725.6098904106248
The news of the arrival of the Pharaon had not yet reached the old man who mounted on a chair was amusing himself by training with trembling hand the nasturtiums and sprays of clematis that clambered over the trellis at his window	148.29004049848126
Suddenly he felt an arm thrown around his body and a wellknown voice behind him exclaimed Fatherdear father	221.21511694656726
The old man uttered a cry and turned round then seeing his son he fell into his arms pale and trembling	27.848563278481034
What ails you my dearest father Are you ill inquired the young man much alarmed	54.32398250391544
No no my dear Edmondmy boymy sonno but I did not expect you and joy the surprise of seeing you so suddenlyAh I feel as if I were going to die	86.36397828774244
Come come cheer up my dear father Tis Ireally I They say joy never hurts and so I came to you without any warning	493.19232002110516
Come now do smile instead of looking at me so solemnly	139.1494511876594
Here I am back again and we are going to be happy	26.280447574582826
Yes yes my boy so we willso we will replied the old man but how shall we be happy Shall you never leave me again Come tell me all the good fortune that has befallen you	111.65792027736647
God forgive me said the young man for rejoicing at happiness derived from the misery of others but Heaven knows I did not seek this good fortune it has happened and I really can not pretend to lament it	151.27622275908666
The good Captain Leclere is dead father and it is probable that with the aid of M	55.70360887781963
Morrel I shall have his place	75.34490617881252
Do you understand father Only imagine me a captain at twenty with a hundred louis pay and a share in the profits Is this not more than a poor sailor like me could have hoped for	130.9222405979864
Yes my dear boy replied the old man it is very fortunate	29.274356698344437
Well then with the first money I touch I mean you to have a small house with a garden in which to plant clematis nasturtiums and honeysuckle	214.56640450933645
But what ails you father Are you not well	42.856375989720156
Tis nothing nothing it will soon pass awayand as he said so the old mans strength failed him and he fell backwards	133.38574039922258
Come come said the young man a glass of wine father will revive you	95.52629139334395
Where do you keep your wine	1786.4481562080755
You need not look for it I do not want it said the old man	13.465239678961822
Yes yes father tell me where it is and he opened two or three cupboards	80.18141414855917
It is no use said the old man there is no wine	39.21682508743294
What no wine said Dants turning pale and looking alternately at the hollow cheeks of the old man and the empty cupboards	72.84996553159465
What no wine Have you wanted money father	1063.119879002561
I want nothing now that I have you said the old man	15.793657355871325
Yet stammered Dants wiping the perspiration from his browyet I gave you two hundred francs when I left three months ago	39.5285330299164
Yes yes Edmond that is true but you forgot at that time a little debt to our neighbor Caderousse	149.2803436242415
He reminded me of it telling me if I did not pay for you he would be paid by M	44.81806369264851
Morrel and so you see lest he might do you an injury	447.632448872664
But cried Dants it was a hundred and forty francs I owed Caderousse	329.1040307763482
And you paid him out of the two hundred francs I left you	20.764893080041432
So that you have lived for three months on sixty francs muttered Edmond	170.00700736508534
You know how little I require said the old man	32.39495623602752
Heaven pardon me cried Edmond falling on his knees before his father	18.551422919457465
You have wounded me to the heart	90.42274675534604
Never mind it for I see you once more said the old man and now its all overeverything is all right again	116.69221102822291
Yes here I am said the young man with a promising future and a little money	59.91764250457429
Here father here he said take thistake it and send for something immediately	1191.6432515154704
And he emptied his pockets on the table the contents consisting of a dozen gold pieces five or six fivefranc pieces and some smaller coin	174.40892167656483
The countenance of old Dants brightened	14720.695779773989
Whom does this belong to he inquired	1817.4503578868237
To me to you to us Take it buy some provisions be happy and tomorrow we shall have more	307.0479105271341
Gently gently said the old man with a smile and by your leave I will use your purse moderately for they would say if they saw me buy too many things at a time that I had been obliged to await your return in order to be able to purchase them	67.21002990762024
Do as you please but first of all pray have a servant father	480.3182797537557
I will not have you left alone so long	153.08682794446392
I have some smuggled coffee and most capital tobacco in a small chest in the hold which you shall have tomorrow	103.31766339101709
Tis Caderousse who has heard of your arrival and no doubt comes to congratulate you on your fortunate return	175.25002449557766
Ah lips that say one thing while the heart thinks another murmured Edmond	574.4386918184481
But never mind he is a neighbor who has done us a service on a time so he s welcome	161.6470752645652
As Edmond paused the black and bearded head of Caderousse appeared at the door	81.40767001676309
He was a man of twentyfive or six and held a piece of cloth which being a tailor he was about to make into a coatlining	173.18238433891287
What is it you Edmond back again said he with a broad Marseillaise accent and a grin that displayed his ivorywhite teeth	282.6820220122366
Yes as you see neighbor Caderousse and ready to be agreeable to you in any and every way replied Dants but illconcealing his coldness under this cloak of civility	328.5778886968484
Thanksthanks but fortunately I do not want for anything and it chances that at times there are others who have need of me	104.46894605928688
I do not allude to you my boy	72.74356839290786
Nono I lent you money and you returned it that s like good neighbors and we are quits	204.86821823596873
We are never quits with those who oblige us was Dants reply for when we do not owe them money we owe them gratitude	134.3869142216302
What s the use of mentioning that What is done is done	215.43256402159037
Let us talk of your happy return my boy	1267.5974623345044
I had gone on the quay to match a piece of mulberry cloth when I met friend Danglars	453.037042839595
I thought you were at Smyrna	958.6675189025431
I was but am now back again	1232.4302674558735
And where is the dear boy our little Edmond	434.01278109413977
Why with his father no doubt replied Danglars	35.946051664084955
And so I came added Caderousse as fast as I could to have the pleasure of shaking hands with a friend	55.761437212345975
Worthy Caderousse said the old man he is so much attached to us	42.24573275842923
Yes to be sure I am	8.402530298528573
I love and esteem you because honest folks are so rare	882.4678818771495
But it seems you have come back rich my boy continued the tailor looking askance at the handful of gold and silver which Dants had thrown on the table	226.82946304218197
The young man remarked the greedy glance which shone in the dark eyes of his neighbor	119.19644655281081
Eh he said negligently this money is not mine	37.698882286217184
I was expressing to my father my fears that he had wanted many things in my absence and to convince me he emptied his purse on the table	65.5347786702982
Come father added Dants put this money back in your boxunless neighbor Caderousse wants anything and in that case it is at his service	218.74683076038522
No my boy no said Caderousse	237.61883091726435
I am not in any want thank God my living is suited to my means	409.74862185435643
Keep your moneykeep it I sayone never has too muchbut at the same time my boy I am as much obliged by your offer as if I took advantage of it	121.00742466866801
It was offered with good will said Dants	2243.113645189576
No doubt my boy no doubt	11.768886910759637
Well you stand well with M	63.14197372774858
Morrel I hearyou insinuating dog you	23.572542437642067
Morrel has always been exceedingly kind to me replied Dants	65.84027645535566
Then you were wrong to refuse to dine with him	63.41328552693517
What did you refuse to dine with him said old Dants and did he invite you to dine	112.9828401336415
Yes my dear father replied Edmond smiling at his fathers astonishment at the excessive honor paid to his son	127.96753512120543
And why did you refuse my son inquired the old man	26.79162356974799
That I might the sooner see you again my dear father replied the young man	24.460569985960642
I was most anxious to see you	50.21388562401264
But it must have vexed M	121.99747864251091
Morrel good worthy man said Caderousse	51.91963371990994
And when you are looking forward to be captain it was wrong to annoy the owner	148.03566326430308
But I explained to him the cause of my refusal replied Dants and I hope he fully understood it	94.1675573986519
Yes but to be captain one must do a little flattery to ones patrons	773.2021572079465
I hope to be captain without that said Dants	275.17075293032184
So much the betterso much the better Nothing will give greater pleasure to all your old friends and I know one down there behind the Saint Nicolas citadel who will not be sorry to hear it	197.1466199932736
Yes my dear father and with your permission now I have seen you and know you are well and have all you require I will ask your consent to go and pay a visit to the Catalans	51.73026520930167
Go my dear boy said old Dants and Heaven bless you in your wife as it has blessed me in my son	118.14811547787492
His wife said Caderousse why how fast you go on father Dants she is not his wife yet as it seems to me	140.3780057354038
No but according to all probability she soon will be replied Edmond	256.3020487548772
Yesyes said Caderousse but you were right to return as soon as possible my boy	52.0082187092759
Because Mercds is a very fine girl and fine girls never lack followers she particularly has them by dozens	1332.4418481866603
Really answered Edmond with a smile which had in it traces of slight uneasiness	179.74764542104427
Ah yes continued Caderousse and capital offers too but you know you will be captain and who could refuse you then	195.36291748028398
Meaning to say replied Dants with a smile which but illconcealed his trouble that if I were not a captain	102.29452325122867
Eheh said Caderousse shaking his head	2.0552020555133113
Come come said the sailor I have a better opinion than you of women in general and of Mercds in particular and I am certain that captain or not she will remain ever faithful to me	122.51790561224296
So much the betterso much the better said Caderousse	68.15615027267081
When one is going to be married there is nothing like implicit confidence but never mind that my boygo and announce your arrival and let her know all your hopes and prospects	246.68750059860918
I will go directly was Edmonds reply and embracing his father and nodding to Caderousse he left the apartment	201.74685794905344
Caderousse lingered for a moment then taking leave of old Dants he went downstairs to rejoin Danglars who awaited him at the corner of the Rue Senac	74.2275283299075
Well said Danglars did you see him	37.370533185567375
I have just left him answered Caderousse	649.4706621903614
Did he allude to his hope of being captain	240.11411706521707
He spoke of it as a thing already decided	546.3310604641197
Indeed said Danglars he is in too much hurry it appears to me	62.11197343149125
Morrel has promised him the thing	1616.2533781544357
So that he is quite elated about it	890.4781955156757
Why yes he is actually insolent over the matterhas already offered me his patronage as if he were a grand personage and proffered me a loan of money as though he were a banker	214.51359747416876
Most assuredly although I might easily have accepted it for it was I who put into his hands the first silver he ever earned but now M	147.889428002505
Dants has no longer any occasion for assistancehe is about to become a captain	224.1794194206266
Pooh said Danglars he is not one yet	143.43949314833606
Ma foi it will be as well if he is not answered Caderousse for if he should be there will be really no speaking to him	56.07029353975785
If we choose replied Danglars he will remain what he is and perhaps become even less than he is	85.93813526681103
And is he still in love with the Catalane	139.6416409811069
Over head and ears but unless I am much mistaken there will be a storm in that quarter	97.03586357501169
It is more important than you think perhaps	109.77414794099664
Then tell me all you know about the Catalane	184.08058713605104
I know nothing for certain only I have seen things which induce me to believe as I told you that the future captain will find some annoyance in the vicinity of the Vieilles Infirmeries	128.45150883223667
What have you seencome tell me	1.4616835271448236
Well every time I have seen Mercds come into the city she has been accompanied by a tall strapping blackeyed Catalan with a red complexion brown skin and fierce air whom she calls cousin	335.04403358961446
Really and you think this cousin pays her attentions	6348.085868645489
What else can a strapping chap of twentyone mean with a fine wench of seventeen	1158.2731201357335
And you say that Dants has gone to the Catalans	43.75448406541312
He went before I came down	15.789200908708157
Let us go the same way we will stop at La Rserve and we can drink a glass of La Malgue whilst we wait for news	141.79101113122175
Come along said Caderousse but you pay the score	220.25800735562612
Of course replied Danglars and going quickly to the designated place they called for a bottle of wine and two glasses	111.14081686298248
Pre Pamphile had seen Dants pass not ten minutes before and assured that he was at the Catalans they sat down under the budding foliage of the planes and sycamores in the branches of which the birds were singing their welcome to one of the first days of spring	124.19058332046613
Beyond a bare weatherworn wall about a hundred paces from the spot where the two friends sat looking and listening as they drank their wine was the village of the Catalans	66.64422487531891
Long ago this mysterious colony quitted Spain and settled on the tongue of land on which it is to this day	123.07840935012753
Whence it came no one knew and it spoke an unknown tongue	890.1005418353394
One of its chiefs who understood Provenal begged the commune of Marseilles to give them this bare and barren promontory where like the sailors of old they had run their boats ashore	741.9263080689295
The request was granted and three months afterwards around the twelve or fifteen small vessels which had brought these gypsies of the sea a small village sprang up	303.70743156895355
This village constructed in a singular and picturesque manner half Moorish half Spanish still remains and is inhabited by descendants of the first comers who speak the language of their fathers	352.0297785428237
For three or four centuries they have remained upon this small promontory on which they had settled like a flight of seabirds without mixing with the Marseillaise population intermarrying and preserving their original customs and the costume of their mothercountry as they have preserved its language	336.52431699134166
Our readers will follow us along the only street of this little village and enter with us one of the houses which is sunburned to the beautiful deadleaf color peculiar to the buildings of the country and within coated with whitewash like a Spanish posada	291.8614620273942
A young and beautiful girl with hair as black as jet her eyes as velvety as the gazelles was leaning with her back against the wainscot rubbing in her slender delicately moulded fingers a bunch of heath blossoms the flowers of which she was picking off and strewing on the floor her arms bare to the elbow brown and modelled after those of the Arlesian Venus moved with a kind of restless impatience and she tapped the earth with her arched and supple foot so as to display the pure and full shape of her wellturned leg in its red cotton gray and blue clocked stocking	293.35368323883336
At three paces from her seated in a chair which he balanced on two legs leaning his elbow on an old wormeaten table was a tall young man of twenty or twoandtwenty who was looking at her with an air in which vexation and uneasiness were mingled	106.92813886469645
He questioned her with his eyes but the firm and steady gaze of the young girl controlled his look	87.26576059785546
You see Mercds said the young man here is Easter come round again tell me is this the moment for a wedding	134.33638745600703
I have answered you a hundred times Fernand and really you must be very stupid to ask me again	123.46697032640526
Well repeat itrepeat it I beg of you that I may at last believe it Tell me for the hundredth time that you refuse my love which had your mothers sanction	168.54322731751006
Make me understand once for all that you are trifling with my happiness that my life or death are nothing to you	68.991407438941
Ah to have dreamed for ten years of being your husband Mercds and to lose that hope which was the only stay of my existence	172.34525614116302
At least it was not I who ever encouraged you in that hope Fernand replied Mercds you can not reproach me with the slightest coquetry	160.00866307133774
I have always said to you I love you as a brother but do not ask from me more than sisterly affection for my heart is anothers	80.53715773096081
Yes that is very true Mercds replied the young man Yes you have been cruelly frank with me but do you forget that it is among the Catalans a sacred law to intermarry	116.46986680427628
You mistake Fernand it is not a law but merely a custom and I pray of you do not cite this custom in your favor	182.13860013716376
You are included in the conscription Fernand and are only at liberty on sufferance liable at any moment to be called upon to take up arms	388.3113325214429
Once a soldier what would you do with me a poor orphan forlorn without fortune with nothing but a halfruined hut and a few ragged nets the miserable inheritance left by my father to my mother and by my mother to me She has been dead a year and you know Fernand I have subsisted almost entirely on public charity	246.1514775193211
Sometimes you pretend I am useful to you and that is an excuse to share with me the produce of your fishing and I accept it Fernand because you are the son of my fathers brother because we were brought up together and still more because it would give you so much pain if I refuse	87.21045231043644
But I feel very deeply that this fish which I go and sell and with the produce of which I buy the flax I spinI feel very keenly Fernand that this is charity	335.04262205496997
And if it were Mercds poor and lone as you are you suit me as well as the daughter of the first shipowner or the richest banker of Marseilles What do such as we desire but a good wife and careful housekeeper and where can I look for these better than in you	174.69913468884317
Fernand answered Mercds shaking her head a woman becomes a bad manager and who shall say she will remain an honest woman when she loves another man better than her husband Rest content with my friendship for I say once more that is all I can promise and I will promise no more than I can bestow	128.18341437565797
I understand replied Fernand you can endure your own wretchedness patiently but you are afraid to share mine	163.18549638656495
Well Mercds beloved by you I would tempt fortune you would bring me good luck and I should become rich	164.06769427980538
I could extend my occupation as a fisherman might get a place as clerk in a warehouse and become in time a dealer myself	341.10681577703605
You could do no such thing Fernand you are a soldier and if you remain at the Catalans it is because there is no war so remain a fisherman and contented with my friendship as I can not give you more	85.02865180862027
Well I will do better Mercds	8139.167399082752
I will be a sailor instead of the costume of our fathers which you despise I will wear a varnished hat a striped shirt and a blue jacket with an anchor on the buttons	140.91261102372184
Would not that dress please you	3.978291520229489
What do you mean asked Mercds with an angry glancewhat do you mean I do not understand you	52.67795952665567
I mean Mercds that you are thus harsh and cruel with me because you are expecting someone who is thus attired but perhaps he whom you await is inconstant or if he is not the sea is so to him	217.44476571514204
Fernand cried Mercds I believed you were goodhearted and I was mistaken Fernand you are wicked to call to your aid jealousy and the anger of God Yes I will not deny it I do await and I do love him of whom you speak and if he does not return instead of accusing him of the inconstancy which you insinuate I will tell you that he died loving me and me only	114.28945689890931
The young girl made a gesture of rage	66.50286976781936
I understand you Fernand you would be revenged on him because I do not love you you would cross your Catalan knife with his dirk	121.49290892505408
What end would that answer To lose you my friendship if he were conquered and see that friendship changed into hate if you were victor	316.07210024331465
Believe me to seek a quarrel with a man is a bad method of pleasing the woman who loves that man	88.6835777762485
No Fernand you will not thus give way to evil thoughts	229.3318347444421
Unable to have me for your wife you will content yourself with having me for your friend and sister and besides she added her eyes troubled and moistened with tears wait wait Fernand you said just now that the sea was treacherous and he has been gone four months and during these four months there have been some terrible storms	142.4003073940069
Fernand made no reply nor did he attempt to check the tears which flowed down the cheeks of Mercds although for each of these tears he would have shed his hearts blood but these tears flowed for another	126.60547193941392
He arose paced a while up and down the hut and then suddenly stopping before Mercds with his eyes glowing and his hands clenchedSay Mercds he said once for all is this your final determination	168.15199550471047
I love Edmond Dants the young girl calmly replied and none but Edmond shall ever be my husband	261.6528819628044
And you will always love him	18.29433438391807
Fernand let fall his head like a defeated man heaved a sigh that was like a groan and then suddenly looking her full in the face with clenched teeth and expanded nostrils saidBut if he is dead	152.76183642701213
If he is dead I shall die too	20.82471456571913
Mercds called a joyous voice from withoutMercds	4253.577188262413
Ah exclaimed the young girl blushing with delight and fairly leaping in excess of love you see he has not forgotten me for here he is And rushing towards the door she opened it saying Here Edmond here I am	179.41472299800097
Fernand pale and trembling drew back like a traveller at the sight of a serpent and fell into a chair beside him	37.401139642307044
Edmond and Mercds were clasped in each others arms	29.524240758840154
The burning Marseilles sun which shot into the room through the open door covered them with a flood of light	31.091890817374004
At first they saw nothing around them	61.36453226849185
Their intense happiness isolated them from all the rest of the world and they only spoke in broken words which are the tokens of a joy so extreme that they seem rather the expression of sorrow	86.8224511216731
Suddenly Edmond saw the gloomy pale and threatening countenance of Fernand as it was defined in the shadow	66.79568441663335
By a movement for which he could scarcely account to himself the young Catalan placed his hand on the knife at his belt	98.25245676245119
Ah your pardon said Dants frowning in his turn I did not perceive that there were three of us	61.24336931496088
Then turning to Mercds he inquired Who is this gentleman	166.11014192937188
One who will be your best friend Dants for he is my friend my cousin my brother it is Fernandthe man whom after you Edmond I love the best in the world	147.40467319117766
Yes said Dants and without relinquishing Mercds hand clasped in one of his own he extended the other to the Catalan with a cordial air	147.6586690641808
But Fernand instead of responding to this amiable gesture remained mute and trembling	406.53237852955044
Edmond then cast his eyes scrutinizingly at the agitated and embarrassed Mercds and then again on the gloomy and menacing Fernand	235.0868722238992
This look told him all and his anger waxed hot	3053.9146974955634
I did not know when I came with such haste to you that I was to meet an enemy here	79.4197884814199
An enemy cried Mercds with an angry look at her cousin	103.72569419612378
An enemy in my house do you say Edmond If I believed that I would place my arm under yours and go with you to Marseilles leaving the house to return to it no more	108.41390965738174
And should any misfortune occur to you dear Edmond she continued with the same calmness which proved to Fernand that the young girl had read the very innermost depths of his sinister thought if misfortune should occur to you I would ascend the highest point of the Cape de Morgiou and cast myself headlong from it	135.60009394675166
But you are deceived Edmond she continued	187.23779433722234
You have no enemy herethere is no one but Fernand my brother who will grasp your hand as a devoted friend	102.9193946700069
And at these words the young girl fixed her imperious look on the Catalan who as if fascinated by it came slowly towards Edmond and offered him his hand	155.82178168522802
His hatred like a powerless though furious wave was broken against the strong ascendancy which Mercds exercised over him	450.470829923441
Scarcely however had he touched Edmonds hand when he felt he had done all he could do and rushed hastily out of the house	100.23391595691075
Oh he exclaimed running furiously and tearing his hairOh who will deliver me from this man Wretchedwretched that I am	158.3372284231338
Hallo Catalan Hallo Fernand where are you running to exclaimed a voice	120.59079427305157
The young man stopped suddenly looked around him and perceived Caderousse sitting at table with Danglars under an arbor	193.39057658692394
Well said Caderousse why do nt you come Are you really in such a hurry that you have no time to pass the time of day with your friends	41.16525744635094
Particularly when they have still a full bottle before them added Danglars	249.86960802264866
Fernand looked at them both with a stupefied air but did not say a word	41.672423024581505
He seems besotted said Danglars pushing Caderousse with his knee	253.88548185265105
Are we mistaken and is Dants triumphant in spite of all we have believed	251.92244186977825
Why we must inquire into that was Caderousses reply and turning towards the young man said Well Catalan ca nt you make up your mind	113.72669042254725
Fernand wiped away the perspiration steaming from his brow and slowly entered the arbor whose shade seemed to restore somewhat of calmness to his senses and whose coolness somewhat of refreshment to his exhausted body	213.81912478718027
You called me did nt you And he fell rather than sat down on one of the seats which surrounded the table	79.56232373270109
I called you because you were running like a madman and I was afraid you would throw yourself into the sea said Caderousse laughing	53.05334199455336
Why when a man has friends they are not only to offer him a glass of wine but moreover to prevent his swallowing three or four pints of water unnecessarily	143.39341343802212
Fernand gave a groan which resembled a sob and dropped his head into his hands his elbows leaning on the table	30.7537382170178
Well Fernand I must say said Caderousse beginning the conversation with that brutality of the common people in which curiosity destroys all diplomacy you look uncommonly like a rejected lover and he burst into a hoarse laugh	374.2000920829198
Bah said Danglars a lad of his make was not born to be unhappy in love	164.84131899362282
You are laughing at him Caderousse	8065.475737131038
No he replied only hark how he sighs Come come Fernand said Caderousse hold up your head and answer us	476.36690551135496
Its not polite not to reply to friends who ask news of your health	204.38863300908736
My health is well enough said Fernand clenching his hands without raising his head	62.72332285799018
Ah you see Danglars said Caderousse winking at his friend this is how it is Fernand whom you see here is a good and brave Catalan one of the best fishermen in Marseilles and he is in love with a very fine girl named Mercds but it appears unfortunately that the fine girl is in love with the mate of the Pharaon and as the Pharaon arrived todaywhy you understand	105.07572541086842
No I do not understand said Danglars	51.09022329499607
Poor Fernand has been dismissed continued Caderousse	5001.364570429298
Well and what then said Fernand lifting up his head and looking at Caderousse like a man who looks for someone on whom to vent his anger Mercds is not accountable to any person is she Is she not free to love whomsoever she will	170.7780433741546
Oh if you take it in that sense said Caderousse it is another thing	81.69348544552759
But I thought you were a Catalan and they told me the Catalans were not men to allow themselves to be supplanted by a rival	143.5438524418912
It was even told me that Fernand especially was terrible in his vengeance	253.83440335396833
A lover is never terrible he said	49.26667605953399
Poor fellow remarked Danglars affecting to pity the young man from the bottom of his heart	28.690041868619545
Why you see he did not expect to see Dants return so suddenlyhe thought he was dead perhaps or perchance faithless These things always come on us more severely when they come suddenly	464.92830130718846
Ah ma foi under any circumstances said Caderousse who drank as he spoke and on whom the fumes of the wine began to take effectunder any circumstances Fernand is not the only person put out by the fortunate arrival of Dants is he Danglars	178.01783549888884
No you are rightand I should say that would bring him illluck	206.17260154145197
Well never mind answered Caderousse pouring out a glass of wine for Fernand and filling his own for the eighth or ninth time while Danglars had merely sipped his	200.35508243542648
Never mindin the meantime he marries Mercdsthe lovely Mercdsat least he returns to do that	3425.7607934871594
During this time Danglars fixed his piercing glance on the young man on whose heart Caderousses words fell like molten lead	179.96823052469674
And when is the wedding to be he asked	106.60327483764495
Oh it is not yet fixed murmured Fernand	2542.8608923596485
No but it will be said Caderousse as surely as Dants will be captain of the Pharaoneh Danglars	236.5042414784418
Danglars shuddered at this unexpected attack and turned to Caderousse whose countenance he scrutinized to try and detect whether the blow was premeditated but he read nothing but envy in a countenance already rendered brutal and stupid by drunkenness	303.5887980846511
Well said he filling the glasses let us drink to Captain Edmond Dants husband of the beautiful Catalane	384.6223885246324
Caderousse raised his glass to his mouth with unsteady hand and swallowed the contents at a gulp	134.94263037721726
Fernand dashed his on the ground	18.283873635406984
What do I see down there by the wall in the direction of the Catalans Look Fernand your eyes are better than mine	92.20240696093835
You know wine is a deceiver but I should say it was two lovers walking side by side and hand in hand	240.3791393285148
Heaven forgive me they do not know that we can see them and they are actually embracing	59.06818274122955
Danglars did not lose one pang that Fernand endured	3541.2249548162
Do you know them Fernand he said	17.85147109972522
Yes was the reply in a low voice	4.755819554696292
Ah see there now said Caderousse and I did not recognize them Hallo Dants hello lovely damsel Come this way and let us know when the wedding is to be for Fernand here is so obstinate he will not tell us	171.84754418536167
Hold your tongue will you said Danglars pretending to restrain Caderousse who with the tenacity of drunkards leaned out of the arbor	257.09320471925395
Try to stand upright and let the lovers make love without interruption	873.7826656167151
See look at Fernand and follow his example he is wellbehaved	382.5958479736739
Fernand probably excited beyond bearing pricked by Danglars as the bull is by the bandilleros was about to rush out for he had risen from his seat and seemed to be collecting himself to dash headlong upon his rival when Mercds smiling and graceful lifted up her lovely head and looked at them with her clear and bright eyes	155.84886951520153
At this Fernand recollected her threat of dying if Edmond died and dropped again heavily on his seat	426.27711861294995
Danglars looked at the two men one after the other the one brutalized by liquor the other overwhelmed with love	216.73813576167672
I shall get nothing from these fools he muttered and I am very much afraid of being here between a drunkard and a coward	169.53387245757784
Heres an envious fellow making himself boozy on wine when he ought to be nursing his wrath and here is a fool who sees the woman he loves stolen from under his nose and takes on like a big baby	392.2376911200328
Yet this Catalan has eyes that glisten like those of the vengeful Spaniards Sicilians and Calabrians and the other has fists big enough to crush an ox at one blow	480.6480913878838
Unquestionably Edmonds star is in the ascendant and he will marry the splendid girlhe will be captain too and laugh at us all unlessa sinister smile passed over Danglars lipsunless I take a hand in the affair he added	390.6574007592491
Hallo continued Caderousse halfrising and with his fist on the table hallo Edmond do you not see your friends or are you too proud to speak to them	83.59447826859697
No my dear fellow replied Dants I am not proud but I am happy and happiness blinds I think more than pride	92.4897961111891
Ah very well that s an explanation said Caderousse	36.111825591739674
How do you do Madame Dants	94.56539546951556
Mercds courtesied gravely and saidThat is not my name and in my country it bodes ill fortune they say to call a young girl by the name of her betrothed before he becomes her husband	122.90362343724188
So call me Mercds if you please	6.352438825339435
We must excuse our worthy neighbor Caderousse said Dants he is so easily mistaken	259.8609558203338
So then the wedding is to take place immediately M	90.63466862925743
Dants said Danglars bowing to the young couple	42.22240631638323
Danglars today all preliminaries will be arranged at my fathers and tomorrow or next day at latest the wedding festival here at La Rserve	160.5272803993103
My friends will be there I hope that is to say you are invited M	69.43687073174135
And Fernand said Caderousse with a chuckle Fernand too is invited	1661.9260883849652
My wifes brother is my brother said Edmond and we Mercds and I should be very sorry if he were absent at such a time	88.64481748286502
Fernand opened his mouth to reply but his voice died on his lips and he could not utter a word	38.78073223992854
Today the preliminaries tomorrow or next day the ceremony You are in a hurry captain	191.50770684367228
Danglars said Edmond smiling I will say to you as Mercds said just now to Caderousse Do not give me a title which does not belong to me that may bring me bad luck	68.87466458773606
Your pardon replied Danglars I merely said you seemed in a hurry and we have lots of time the Pharaon can not be under weigh again in less than three months	113.69171842852113
We are always in a hurry to be happy M	80.62461738277871
Danglars for when we have suffered a long time we have great difficulty in believing in good fortune	101.57370062112925
But it is not selfishness alone that makes me thus in haste I must go to Paris	61.51582291254985
Ah reallyto Paris and will it be the first time you have ever been there Dants	59.822656127097105
Not of my own the last commission of poor Captain Leclere you know to what I allude Danglarsit is sacred	411.0709907067453
Besides I shall only take the time to go and return	33.6153310239291
Yes yes I understand said Danglars and then in a low tone he added To Paris no doubt to deliver the letter which the grand marshal gave him	79.74235741365749
Ah this letter gives me an ideaa capital idea Ah Dants my friend you are not yet registered number one on board the good ship Pharaon then turning towards Edmond who was walking away A pleasant journey he cried	360.8903879190902
Thank you said Edmond with a friendly nod and the two lovers continued on their way as calm and joyous as if they were the very elect of heaven	119.79943496806351
Danglars followed Edmond and Mercds with his eyes until the two lovers disappeared behind one of the angles of Fort Saint Nicolas then turning round he perceived Fernand who had fallen pale and trembling into his chair while Caderousse stammered out the words of a drinkingsong	111.35467020896631
Well my dear sir said Danglars to Fernand here is a marriage which does not appear to make everybody happy	77.25166283467543
It drives me to despair said Fernand	150.53104400336397
As long as I have known heralways	10755.282861734164
And you sit there tearing your hair instead of seeking to remedy your condition I did not think that was the way of your people	78.03687606220113
What would you have me do said Fernand	364.19768575456993
How do I know Is it my affair I am not in love with Mademoiselle Mercds but for youin the words of the gospel seek and you shall find	105.91832232479727
I would stab the man but the woman told me that if any misfortune happened to her betrothed she would kill herself	71.55267327788971
Pooh Women say those things but never do them	239.70045152295964
You do not know Mercds what she threatens she will do	254.1799664138464
Idiot muttered Danglars whether she kill herself or not what matter provided Dants is not captain	429.48810467600697
Before Mercds should die replied Fernand with the accents of unshaken resolution I would die myself	223.7568184791471
That s what I call love said Caderousse with a voice more tipsy than ever	60.0068952868714
That s love or I do nt know what love is	29.583432793004338
Come said Danglars you appear to me a good sort of fellow and hang me I should like to help you but	54.71210873036131
My dear fellow replied Danglars you are three parts drunk finish the bottle and you will be completely so	160.43088060385213
Drink then and do not meddle with what we are discussing for that requires all ones wit and cool judgment	477.82080907815885
Idrunk said Caderousse well that s a good one I could drink four more such bottles they are no bigger than cologne flasks	501.6268748390636
And Caderousse rattled his glass upon the table	18.84453872867534
You were saying sir said Fernand awaiting with great anxiety the end of this interrupted remark	235.11941868910353
What was I saying I forget	522.4429727437944
This drunken Caderousse has made me lose the thread of my sentence	80.18038308022487
Drunk if you like so much the worse for those who fear wine for it is because they have bad thoughts which they are afraid the liquor will extract from their hearts and Caderousse began to sing the two last lines of a song very popular at the time	143.19828458354118
Tous les mchants sont buveurs deau	19186.00851543889
Cest bien prouv par le dluge	4746.941226586089
You said sir you would like to help me but	83.80719537728181
Yes but I added to help you it would be sufficient that Dants did not marry her you love and the marriage may easily be thwarted methinks and yet Dants need not die	149.28974413009396
Death alone can separate them remarked Fernand	2976.2297951980327
You talk like a noodle my friend said Caderousse and here is Danglars who is a wideawake clever deep fellow who will prove to you that you are wrong	100.57307043650225
Say there is no need why Dants should die it would indeed be a pity he should	135.4964069988586
Dants is a good fellow I like Dants	702.9423508069306
Let him run on said Danglars restraining the young man drunk as he is he is not much out in what he says	107.85302639356031
Absence severs as well as death and if the walls of a prison were between Edmond and Mercds they would be as effectually separated as if he lay under a tombstone	180.8955678287388
Yes but one gets out of prison said Caderousse who with what sense was left him listened eagerly to the conversation and when one gets out and ones name is Edmond Dants one seeks revenge	261.5580381464433
And why I should like to know persisted Caderousse should they put Dants in prison he has neither robbed nor killed nor murdered	531.1619252857752
I wo nt hold my tongue replied Caderousse I say I want to know why they should put Dants in prison I like Dants Dants your health and he swallowed another glass of wine	232.08131879281274
Danglars saw in the muddled look of the tailor the progress of his intoxication and turning towards Fernand said Well you understand there is no need to kill him	103.34159133062904
Certainly not if as you said just now you have the means of having Dants arrested	65.03295265164766
It is to be found for the searching	328.4484401152877
But why should I meddle in the matter it is no affair of mine	49.56208554851957
I know not why you meddle said Fernand seizing his arm but this I know you have some motive of personal hatred against Dants for he who himself hates is never mistaken in the sentiments of others	217.57426872557403
I motives of hatred against Dants None on my word I saw you were unhappy and your unhappiness interested me that s all but since you believe I act for my own account adieu my dear friend get out of the affair as best you may and Danglars rose as if he meant to depart	140.41171743685035
No no said Fernand restraining him stay It is of very little consequence to me at the end of the matter whether you have any angry feeling or not against Dants	120.98653041304777
I hate him I confess it openly	1383.3939675020106
Do you find the means I will execute it provided it is not to kill the man for Mercds has declared she will kill herself if Dants is killed	147.04788067781672
Caderousse who had let his head drop on the table now raised it and looking at Fernand with his dull and fishy eyes he said Kill Dants who talks of killing Dants I wo nt have him killedI wo nt He s my friend and this morning offered to share his money with me as I shared mine with him	164.37304004649684
I wo nt have Dants killedI wo nt	630.7139211710105
And who has said a word about killing him muddlehead replied Danglars	485.6421713061416
We were merely joking drink to his health he added filling Caderousses glass and do not interfere with us	137.70590702630406
Yes yes Dants good health said Caderousse emptying his glass heres to his health his healthhurrah	418.4111294195964
But the meansthe means said Fernand	1455.6292906331105
Have you not hit upon any asked Danglars	183.14363262296763
True replied Danglars the French have the superiority over the Spaniards that the Spaniards ruminate while the French invent	630.1816289082833
Do you invent then said Fernand impatiently	841.697715704201
Waiter said Danglars pen ink and paper	1.435178405557216
Pen ink and paper muttered Fernand	743.1642558157695
Yes I am a supercargo pen ink and paper are my tools and without my tools I am fit for nothing	196.03575347952068
Pen ink and paper then called Fernand loudly	1166.5109814603127
There s what you want on that table said the waiter	119.06782226448922
The waiter did as he was desired	117.23144493734468
When one thinks said Caderousse letting his hand drop on the paper there is here wherewithal to kill a man more sure than if we waited at the corner of a wood to assassinate him I have always had more dread of a pen a bottle of ink and a sheet of paper than of a sword or pistol	100.6686166595431
The fellow is not so drunk as he appears to be said Danglars	84.03580372143469
Give him some more wine Fernand	7063.693487265287
Fernand filled Caderousses glass who like the confirmed toper he was lifted his hand from the paper and seized the glass	77.06707139007305
The Catalan watched him until Caderousse almost overcome by this fresh assault on his senses rested or rather dropped his glass upon the table	168.4168695746043
Well resumed the Catalan as he saw the final glimmer of Caderousses reason vanishing before the last glass of wine	245.65918340780735
Well then I should say for instance resumed Danglars that if after a voyage such as Dants has just made in which he touched at the Island of Elba someone were to denounce him to the kings procureur as a Bonapartist agent	129.24549073978102
I will denounce him exclaimed the young man hastily	17.83458109207148
Yes but they will make you then sign your declaration and confront you with him you have denounced I will supply you with the means of supporting your accusation for I know the fact well	184.00002049199188
But Dants can not remain forever in prison and one day or other he will leave it and the day when he comes out woe betide him who was the cause of his incarceration	126.40568310253012
Oh I should wish nothing better than that he would come and seek a quarrel with me	60.37559061806486
Yes and Mercds Mercds who will detest you if you have only the misfortune to scratch the skin of her dearly beloved Edmond	200.03083777236884
No no continued Danglars if we resolve on such a step it would be much better to take as I now do this pen dip it into this ink and write with the left hand that the writing may not be recognized the denunciation we propose	117.22256956541791
And Danglars uniting practice with theory wrote with his left hand and in a writing reversed from his usual style and totally unlike it the following lines which he handed to Fernand and which Fernand read in an undertone	227.7583625091446
The honorable the kings attorney is informed by a friend of the throne and religion that one Edmond Dants mate of the ship Pharaon arrived this morning from Smyrna after having touched at Naples and PortoFerrajo has been intrusted by Murat with a letter for the usurper and by the usurper with a letter for the Bonapartist committee in Paris	74.5901086219981
Proof of this crime will be found on arresting him for the letter will be found upon him or at his fathers or in his cabin on board the Pharaon	81.98824199451262
Very good resumed Danglars now your revenge looks like common sense for in no way can it revert to yourself and the matter will thus work its own way there is nothing to do now but fold the letter as I am doing and write upon it To the kings attorney and that s all settled	167.36722980781698
And Danglars wrote the address as he spoke	35.099490354084516
Yes and that s all settled exclaimed Caderousse who by a last effort of intellect had followed the reading of the letter and instinctively comprehended all the misery which such a denunciation must entail	266.73098125280353
Yes and that s all settled only it will be an infamous shame and he stretched out his hand to reach the letter	65.34996684914242
Yes said Danglars taking it from beyond his reach and as what I say and do is merely in jest and I amongst the first and foremost should be sorry if anything happened to Dantsthe worthy Dantslook here And taking the letter he squeezed it up in his hands and threw it into a corner of the arbor	201.97688369135346
Dants is my friend and I wo nt have him illused	238.49376815465527
And who thinks of using him ill Certainly neither I nor Fernand said Danglars rising and looking at the young man who still remained seated but whose eye was fixed on the denunciatory sheet of paper flung into the corner	110.20936615920785
In this case replied Caderousse lets have some more wine	1632.141973388246
I wish to drink to the health of Edmond and the lovely Mercds	107.37478050363211
You have had too much already drunkard said Danglars and if you continue you will be compelled to sleep here because unable to stand on your legs	136.21511743203993
I said Caderousse rising with all the offended dignity of a drunken man I ca nt keep on my legs Why Ill wager I can go up into the belfry of the Accoules and without staggering too	155.27541527030925
Done said Danglars Ill take your bet but tomorrowtoday it is time to return	138.45634335056812
Give me your arm and let us go	9.291373777827673
Very well let us go said Caderousse but I do nt want your arm at all	45.49897893848449
Come Fernand wo nt you return to Marseilles with us	69.32597935142184
No said Fernand I shall return to the Catalans	55.389260990616066
Come with us to Marseillescome along	15967.57149021745
What do you mean you will not Well just as you like my prince there s liberty for all the world	116.3354392651982
Come along Danglars and let the young gentleman return to the Catalans if he chooses	130.3668966185108
Danglars took advantage of Caderousses temper at the moment to take him off towards Marseilles by the Porte SaintVictor staggering as he went	144.03596768322618
When they had advanced about twenty yards Danglars looked back and saw Fernand stoop pick up the crumpled paper and putting it into his pocket then rush out of the arbor towards Pillon	214.75618098376466
Well said Caderousse why what a lie he told He said he was going to the Catalans and he is going to the city	106.43003211995956
Hallo Fernand You are coming my boy	246.40637110662618
Oh you do nt see straight said Danglars he s gone right by the road to the Vieilles Infirmeries	309.02970931847506
Well said Caderousse I should have sworn that he turned to the righthow treacherous wine is	388.55761737055707
Come come said Danglars to himself now the thing is at work and it will effect its purpose unassisted	341.216014596116
The mornings sun rose clear and resplendent touching the foamy waves into a network of rubytinted light	602.8517067695052
The feast had been made ready on the second floor at La Rserve with whose arbor the reader is already familiar	191.1330757103865
The apartment destined for the purpose was spacious and lighted by a number of windows over each of which was written in golden letters for some inexplicable reason the name of one of the principal cities of France beneath these windows a wooden balcony extended the entire length of the house	124.98494192661902
And although the entertainment was fixed for twelve oclock an hour previous to that time the balcony was filled with impatient and expectant guests consisting of the favored part of the crew of the Pharaon and other personal friends of the bridegroom the whole of whom had arrayed themselves in their choicest costumes in order to do greater honor to the occasion	181.13850522749968
Various rumors were afloat to the effect that the owners of the Pharaon had promised to attend the nuptial feast but all seemed unanimous in doubting that an act of such rare and exceeding condescension could possibly be intended	212.9338467628609
Danglars however who now made his appearance accompanied by Caderousse effectually confirmed the report stating that he had recently conversed with M	314.49065709691627
Morrel who had himself assured him of his intention to dine at La Rserve	55.939062668150186
In fact a moment later M	171.75614780732414
Morrel appeared and was saluted with an enthusiastic burst of applause from the crew of the Pharaon who hailed the visit of the shipowner as a sure indication that the man whose wedding feast he thus delighted to honor would ere long be first in command of the ship and as Dants was universally beloved on board his vessel the sailors put no restraint on their tumultuous joy at finding that the opinion and choice of their superiors so exactly coincided with their own	236.0453911712135
Morrel Danglars and Caderousse were despatched in search of the bridegroom to convey to him the intelligence of the arrival of the important personage whose coming had created such a lively sensation and to beseech him to make haste	141.46612923204256
Danglars and Caderousse set off upon their errand at full speed but ere they had gone many steps they perceived a group advancing towards them composed of the betrothed pair a party of young girls in attendance on the bride by whose side walked Dants father the whole brought up by Fernand whose lips wore their usual sinister smile	225.69892166600553
Neither Mercds nor Edmond observed the strange expression of his countenance they were so happy that they were conscious only of the sunshine and the presence of each other	69.71295095343484
Having acquitted themselves of their errand and exchanged a hearty shake of the hand with Edmond Danglars and Caderousse took their places beside Fernand and old Dantsthe latter of whom attracted universal notice	443.14545352400984
The old man was attired in a suit of glistening watered silk trimmed with steel buttons beautifully cut and polished	337.32891258323053
His thin but wiry legs were arrayed in a pair of richly embroidered clocked stockings evidently of English manufacture while from his threecornered hat depended a long streaming knot of white and blue ribbons	594.9488995820652
Thus he came along supporting himself on a curiously carved stick his aged countenance lit up with happiness looking for all the world like one of the aged dandies of 1796 parading the newly opened gardens of the Luxembourg and Tuileries	323.1172891977175
Beside him glided Caderousse whose desire to partake of the good things provided for the wedding party had induced him to become reconciled to the Dants father and son although there still lingered in his mind a faint and unperfect recollection of the events of the preceding night just as the brain retains on waking in the morning the dim and misty outline of a dream	205.0239847823966
As Danglars approached the disappointed lover he cast on him a look of deep meaning while Fernand as he slowly paced behind the happy pair who seemed in their own unmixed content to have entirely forgotten that such a being as himself existed was pale and abstracted occasionally however a deep flush would overspread his countenance and a nervous contraction distort his features while with an agitated and restless gaze he would glance in the direction of Marseilles like one who either anticipated or foresaw some great and important event	328.79612488852933
Dants himself was simply but becomingly clad in the dress peculiar to the merchant servicea costume somewhat between a military and a civil garb and with his fine countenance radiant with joy and happiness a more perfect specimen of manly beauty could scarcely be imagined	289.4544672421295
Lovely as the Greek girls of Cyprus or Chios Mercds boasted the same bright flashing eyes of jet and ripe round coral lips	572.9880344758723
She moved with the light free step of an Arlesienne or an Andalusian	636.5093680591408
One more practiced in the arts of great cities would have hid her blushes beneath a veil or at least have cast down her thickly fringed lashes so as to have concealed the liquid lustre of her animated eyes but on the contrary the delighted girl looked around her with a smile that seemed to say If you are my friends rejoice with me for I am very happy	127.96198251076763
As soon as the bridal party came in sight of La Rserve M	124.28684424087574
Morrel descended and came forth to meet it followed by the soldiers and sailors there assembled to whom he had repeated the promise already given that Dants should be the successor to the late Captain Leclere	184.9417590738907
Edmond at the approach of his patron respectfully placed the arm of his affianced bride within that of M	220.25605381143953
Morrel who forthwith conducting her up the flight of wooden steps leading to the chamber in which the feast was prepared was gayly followed by the guests beneath whose heavy tread the slight structure creaked and groaned for the space of several minutes	174.07635369449497
Father said Mercds stopping when she had reached the centre of the table sit I pray you on my right hand on my left I will place him who has ever been as a brother to me pointing with a soft and gentle smile to Fernand but her words and look seemed to inflict the direst torture on him for his lips became ghastly pale and even beneath the dark hue of his complexion the blood might be seen retreating as though some sudden pang drove it back to the heart	116.41080109928727
During this time Dants at the opposite side of the table had been occupied in similarly placing his most honored guests	94.75520496872527
Morrel was seated at his right hand Danglars at his left while at a sign from Edmond the rest of the company ranged themselves as they found it most agreeable	123.20055285531589
Then they began to pass around the dusky piquant Arlesian sausages and lobsters in their dazzling red cuirasses prawns of large size and brilliant color the echinus with its prickly outside and dainty morsel within the clovis esteemed by the epicures of the South as more than rivalling the exquisite flavor of the oyster North	713.2293106404502
All the delicacies in fact that are cast up by the wash of waters on the sandy beach and styled by the grateful fishermen fruits of the sea	351.7344772343131
A pretty silence truly said the old father of the bridegroom as he carried to his lips a glass of wine of the hue and brightness of the topaz and which had just been placed before Mercds herself	76.58949906341059
Now would anybody think that this room contained a happy merry party who desire nothing better than to laugh and dance the hours away	371.11605120425776
Ah sighed Caderousse a man can not always feel happy because he is about to be married	57.43393512276681
The truth is replied Dants that I am too happy for noisy mirth if that is what you meant by your observation my worthy friend you are right joy takes a strange effect at times it seems to oppress us almost the same as sorrow	176.59967691729753
Danglars looked towards Fernand whose excitable nature received and betrayed each fresh impression	2421.813628432824
Why what ails you asked he of Edmond	254.7584159127101
Do you fear any approaching evil I should say that you were the happiest man alive at this instant	94.24394060525319
And that is the very thing that alarms me returned Dants	499.2930996615691
Man does not appear to me to be intended to enjoy felicity so unmixed happiness is like the enchanted palaces we read of in our childhood where fierce fiery dragons defend the entrance and approach and monsters of all shapes and kinds requiring to be overcome ere victory is ours	673.230695532004
I own that I am lost in wonder to find myself promoted to an honor of which I feel myself unworthythat of being the husband of Mercds	190.57618635373694
Nay nay cried Caderousse smiling you have not attained that honor yet	85.64672672486397
Mercds is not yet your wife	118.15557876364723
Just assume the tone and manner of a husband and see how she will remind you that your hour is not yet come	81.38550972711738
The bride blushed while Fernand restless and uneasy seemed to start at every fresh sound and from time to time wiped away the large drops of perspiration that gathered on his brow	99.6496441532696
Well never mind that neighbor Caderousse it is not worthwhile to contradict me for such a trifle as that	106.4892683853809
Tis true that Mercds is not actually my wife but added he drawing out his watch in an hour and a half she will be	68.85276032047383
A general exclamation of surprise ran round the table with the exception of the elder Dants whose laugh displayed the still perfect beauty of his large white teeth	100.47609966422252
Mercds looked pleased and gratified while Fernand grasped the handle of his knife with a convulsive clutch	138.6389202351701
In an hour inquired Danglars turning pale	25.20079955553515
Why thus it is replied Dants	309.8315216722585
Thanks to the influence of M	43.07759872730316
Morrel to whom next to my father I owe every blessing I enjoy every difficulty has been removed	273.3180770286108
We have purchased permission to waive the usual delay and at halfpast two oclock the Mayor of Marseilles will be waiting for us at the city hall	156.99547548119182
Now as a quarterpast one has already struck I do not consider I have asserted too much in saying that in another hour and thirty minutes Mercds will have become Madame Dants	203.90958333431294
Fernand closed his eyes a burning sensation passed across his brow and he was compelled to support himself by the table to prevent his falling from his chair but in spite of all his efforts he could not refrain from uttering a deep groan which however was lost amid the noisy felicitations of the company	64.99364176916296
Upon my word cried the old man you make short work of this kind of affair	83.16326781196823
Arrived here only yesterday morning and married today at three oclock Commend me to a sailor for going the quick way to work	267.723732898149
But asked Danglars in a timid tone how did you manage about the other formalitiesthe contractthe settlement	565.9601425099263
The contract answered Dants laughingly it did nt take long to fix that	325.9506713003302
Mercds has no fortune I have none to settle on her	100.01773438880038
So you see our papers were quickly written out and certainly do not come very expensive	366.83927829342116
This joke elicited a fresh burst of applause	283.8981082436252
So that what we presumed to be merely the betrothal feast turns out to be the actual wedding dinner said Danglars	353.28004358915103
No no answered Dants do nt imagine I am going to put you off in that shabby manner	91.06751250530496
Tomorrow morning I start for Paris four days to go and the same to return with one day to discharge the commission entrusted to me is all the time I shall be absent	111.4127841104381
I shall be back here by the first of March and on the second I give my real marriage feast	120.52127434222471
This prospect of fresh festivity redoubled the hilarity of the guests to such a degree that the elder Dants who at the commencement of the repast had commented upon the silence that prevailed now found it difficult amid the general din of voices to obtain a moments tranquillity in which to drink to the health and prosperity of the bride and bridegroom	182.16116340612402
Dants perceiving the affectionate eagerness of his father responded by a look of grateful pleasure while Mercds glanced at the clock and made an expressive gesture to Edmond	87.61286520464081
Around the table reigned that noisy hilarity which usually prevails at such a time among people sufficiently free from the demands of social position not to feel the trammels of etiquette	443.0811830069913
Such as at the commencement of the repast had not been able to seat themselves according to their inclination rose unceremoniously and sought out more agreeable companions	314.6056940541962
Everybody talked at once without waiting for a reply and each one seemed to be contented with expressing his or her own thoughts	131.9959347076003
Fernands paleness appeared to have communicated itself to Danglars	497.34710357930123
As for Fernand himself he seemed to be enduring the tortures of the damned unable to rest he was among the first to quit the table and as though seeking to avoid the hilarious mirth that rose in such deafening sounds he continued in utter silence to pace the farther end of the salon	164.6750973967942
Caderousse approached him just as Danglars whom Fernand seemed most anxious to avoid had joined him in a corner of the room	127.55653270204891
Upon my word said Caderousse from whose mind the friendly treatment of Dants united with the effect of the excellent wine he had partaken of had effaced every feeling of envy or jealousy at Dants good fortuneupon my word Dants is a downright good fellow and when I see him sitting there beside his pretty wife that is so soon to be	324.8336036237775
I can not help thinking it would have been a great pity to have served him that trick you were planning yesterday	109.81774869988348
Oh there was no harm meant answered Danglars at first I certainly did feel somewhat uneasy as to what Fernand might be tempted to do but when I saw how completely he had mastered his feelings even so far as to become one of his rivals attendants I knew there was no further cause for apprehension	195.13279595064503
Caderousse looked full at Fernandhe was ghastly pale	1362.0713982276964
Certainly continued Danglars the sacrifice was no trifling one when the beauty of the bride is concerned	168.25391265235902
Upon my soul that future captain of mine is a lucky dog Gad I only wish he would let me take his place	156.84499049281365
Shall we not set forth asked the sweet silvery voice of Mercds two oclock has just struck and you know we are expected in a quarter of an hour	62.78516008547839
To be sureto be sure cried Dants eagerly quitting the table let us go directly	129.17235917864787
His words were reechoed by the whole party with vociferous cheers	862.5939935897322
At this moment Danglars who had been incessantly observing every change in Fernands look and manner saw him stagger and fall back with an almost convulsive spasm against a seat placed near one of the open windows	277.3933172222323
At the same instant his ear caught a sort of indistinct sound on the stairs followed by the measured tread of soldiery with the clanking of swords and military accoutrements then came a hum and buzz as of many voices so as to deaden even the noisy mirth of the bridal party among whom a vague feeling of curiosity and apprehension quelled every disposition to talk and almost instantaneously the most deathlike stillness prevailed	438.56038751553336
Three blows were struck upon the panel of the door	24.005914504043243
The company looked at each other in consternation	75.99925095307715
I demand admittance said a loud voice outside the room in the name of the law As no attempt was made to prevent it the door was opened and a magistrate wearing his official scarf presented himself followed by four soldiers and a corporal	111.39852872362795
Uneasiness now yielded to the most extreme dread on the part of those present	171.61663871113976
May I venture to inquire the reason of this unexpected visit said M	67.73133762163751
Morrel addressing the magistrate whom he evidently knew there is doubtless some mistake easily explained	547.4887096259943
If it be so replied the magistrate rely upon every reparation being made meanwhile I am the bearer of an order of arrest and although I most reluctantly perform the task assigned me it must nevertheless be fulfilled	354.47145294578144
Who among the persons here assembled answers to the name of Edmond Dants	209.8736886882256
Every eye was turned towards the young man who spite of the agitation he could not but feel advanced with dignity and said in a firm voice	71.22677573694311
I am he what is your pleasure with me	52.68187905193912
Edmond Dants replied the magistrate I arrest you in the name of the law	33.21387054540909
Me repeated Edmond slightly changing color and wherefore I pray	536.0572222979391
I can not inform you but you will be duly acquainted with the reasons that have rendered such a step necessary at the preliminary examination	133.06917051393492
Morrel felt that further resistance or remonstrance was useless	1472.4918068397662
He saw before him an officer delegated to enforce the law and perfectly well knew that it would be as unavailing to seek pity from a magistrate decked with his official scarf as to address a petition to some cold marble effigy	332.1513009689679
There are situations which the heart of a father or a mother can not be made to understand	34.061686979665495
He prayed and supplicated in terms so moving that even the officer was touched and although firm in his duty he kindly said My worthy friend let me beg of you to calm your apprehensions	276.94970609949905
Your son has probably neglected some prescribed form or attention in registering his cargo and it is more than probable he will be set at liberty directly he has given the information required whether touching the health of his crew or the value of his freight	220.4101813149468
What is the meaning of all this inquired Caderousse frowningly of Danglars who had assumed an air of utter surprise	133.3751246240565
How can I tell you replied he I am like yourself utterly bewildered at all that is going on and can not in the least make out what it is about	105.11772231092652
Caderousse then looked around for Fernand but he had disappeared	76.01035124708964
The scene of the previous night now came back to his mind with startling clearness	315.98269937774546
The painful catastrophe he had just witnessed appeared effectually to have rent away the veil which the intoxication of the evening before had raised between himself and his memory	190.04011617549202
So so said he in a hoarse and choking voice to Danglars this then I suppose is a part of the trick you were concerting yesterday All I can say is that if it be so tis an ill turn and well deserves to bring double evil on those who have projected it	197.57775813583294
Nonsense returned Danglars I tell you again I have nothing whatever to do with it besides you know very well that I tore the paper to pieces	34.586911607626675
No you did not answered Caderousse you merely threw it byI saw it lying in a corner	320.6401963528383
Hold your tongue you foolwhat should you know about itwhy you were drunk	442.5533035260102
How do I know replied Danglars gone as every prudent man ought to be to look after his own affairs most likely	186.90976082799622
Never mind where he is let you and I go and see what is to be done for our poor friends	48.761226111145824
During this conversation Dants after having exchanged a cheerful shake of the hand with all his sympathizing friends had surrendered himself to the officer sent to arrest him merely saying Make yourselves quite easy my good fellows there is some little mistake to clear up that s all depend upon it and very likely I may not have to go so far as the prison to effect that	190.95278894919977
Oh to be sure responded Danglars who had now approached the group nothing more than a mistake I feel quite certain	107.75518367026218
Dants descended the staircase preceded by the magistrate and followed by the soldiers	32.715912038991696
A carriage awaited him at the door he got in followed by two soldiers and the magistrate and the vehicle drove off towards Marseilles	100.6552636924851
Adieu adieu dearest Edmond cried Mercds stretching out her arms to him from the balcony	65.41631177756463
The prisoner heard the cry which sounded like the sob of a broken heart and leaning from the coach he called out Goodbye Mercdswe shall soon meet again Then the vehicle disappeared round one of the turnings of Fort Saint Nicholas	228.5031519694266
Wait for me here all of you cried M	230.01524237144704
Morrel I will take the first conveyance I find and hurry to Marseilles whence I will bring you word how all is going on	247.87188872932154
That s right exclaimed a multitude of voices go and return as quickly as you can	93.96425965351587
This second departure was followed by a long and fearful state of terrified silence on the part of those who were left behind	58.39119342067192
The old father and Mercds remained for some time apart each absorbed in grief but at length the two poor victims of the same blow raised their eyes and with a simultaneous burst of feeling rushed into each others arms	120.3019119030634
Meanwhile Fernand made his appearance poured out for himself a glass of water with a trembling hand then hastily swallowing it went to sit down at the first vacant place and this was by mere chance placed next to the seat on which poor Mercds had fallen half fainting when released from the warm and affectionate embrace of old Dants	164.46380595790563
Instinctively Fernand drew back his chair	116.106073941122
He is the cause of all this miseryI am quite sure of it whispered Caderousse who had never taken his eyes off Fernand to Danglars	188.60748777055647
I do nt think so answered the other he s too stupid to imagine such a scheme	180.84665981243086
I only hope the mischief will fall upon the head of whoever wrought it	166.12447184208582
You do nt mention those who aided and abetted the deed said Caderousse	663.8307585385697
Surely answered Danglars one can not be held responsible for every chance arrow shot into the air	186.35376093581237
You can indeed when the arrow lights point downward on somebodys head	13108.807693166455
Meantime the subject of the arrest was being canvassed in every different form	638.0120214214891
What think you Danglars said one of the party turning towards him of this event	83.10217201863775
Why replied he I think it just possible Dants may have been detected with some trifling article on board ship considered here as contraband	629.3761809965453
But how could he have done so without your knowledge Danglars since you are the ships supercargo	261.3751759654449
Why as for that I could only know what I was told respecting the merchandise with which the vessel was laden	194.685116135198
I know she was loaded with cotton and that she took in her freight at Alexandria from Pastrets warehouse and at Smyrna from Pascals that is all I was obliged to know and I beg I may not be asked for any further particulars	193.5918459069247
Now I recollect said the afflicted old father my poor boy told me yesterday he had got a small case of coffee and another of tobacco for me	224.66290799357526
Now the mischief is out depend upon it the customhouse people went rummaging about the ship in our absence and discovered poor Dants hidden treasures	759.0827287994447
Mercds however paid no heed to this explanation of her lovers arrest	112.8540740467306
Her grief which she had hitherto tried to restrain now burst out in a violent fit of hysterical sobbing	472.778002532325
Come come said the old man be comforted my poor child there is still hope	104.85642199574649
Hope faintly murmured Fernand but the word seemed to die away on his pale agitated lips and a convulsive spasm passed over his countenance	87.29768617696037
Good news good news shouted forth one of the party stationed in the balcony on the lookout	134.83741096836042
No doubt now we shall hear that our friend is released	159.9617494943944
Mercds and the old man rushed to meet the shipowner and greeted him at the door	59.57570483269041
What news exclaimed a general burst of voices	349.0240548786336
Morrel with a mournful shake of his head the thing has assumed a more serious aspect than I expected	125.92217632948432
Oh indeedindeed sir he is innocent sobbed forth Mercds	14305.676676748859
Morrel but still he is charged	2964.442806815928
With what inquired the elder Dants	160.822962121485
With being an agent of the Bonapartist faction Many of our readers may be able to recollect how formidable such an accusation became in the period at which our story is dated	280.7869118465668
A despairing cry escaped the pale lips of Mercds the old man sank into a chair	31.16954002918755
Ah Danglars whispered Caderousse you have deceived methe trick you spoke of last night has been played but I can not suffer a poor old man or an innocent girl to die of grief through your fault	110.2521606737057
I am determined to tell them all about it	34.31629560113315
Be silent you simpleton cried Danglars grasping him by the arm or I will not answer even for your own safety	95.21258330296372
Who can tell whether Dants be innocent or guilty The vessel did touch at Elba where he quitted it and passed a whole day in the island	251.68565500183004
Now should any letters or other documents of a compromising character be found upon him will it not be taken for granted that all who uphold him are his accomplices	292.6885564818303
With the rapid instinct of selfishness Caderousse readily perceived the solidity of this mode of reasoning he gazed doubtfully wistfully on Danglars and then caution supplanted generosity	1333.0614403495772
Suppose we wait a while and see what comes of it said he casting a bewildered look on his companion	96.26139778667716
Let us wait by all means	30.25446837588934
If he be innocent of course he will be set at liberty if guilty why it is no use involving ourselves in a conspiracy	180.49272493204495
I can not stay here any longer	198.0021687001212
With all my heart replied Danglars pleased to find the other so tractable	271.62812985404673
Let us take ourselves out of the way and leave things for the present to take their course	77.89149776695018
After their departure Fernand who had now again become the friend and protector of Mercds led the girl to her home while some friends of Dants conducted his father nearly lifeless to the Alles de Meilhan	163.34035996565626
The rumor of Edmonds arrest as a Bonapartist agent was not slow in circulating throughout the city	405.4856111948082
Could you ever have credited such a thing my dear Danglars asked M	80.39389169861236
Morrel as on his return to the port for the purpose of gleaning fresh tidings of Dants from M	188.19981934983127
de Villefort the assistant procureur he overtook his supercargo and Caderousse	615.3745568107483
Could you have believed such a thing possible	89.93400182503406
Why you know I told you replied Danglars that I considered the circumstance of his having anchored at the Island of Elba as a very suspicious circumstance	68.22822809247607
And did you mention these suspicions to any person beside myself	664.252661217079
Then added in a low whisper You understand that on account of your uncle M	238.3472473775545
Policar Morrel who served under the other government and who does not altogether conceal what he thinks on the subject you are strongly suspected of regretting the abdication of Napoleon	163.5811448818079
I should have feared to injure both Edmond and yourself had I divulged my own apprehensions to a soul	684.1877745639035
I am too well aware that though a subordinate like myself is bound to acquaint the shipowner with everything that occurs there are many things he ought most carefully to conceal from all else	259.6137440363853
Tis well Danglarstis well replied M	46.58766346010754
You are a worthy fellow and I had already thought of your interests in the event of poor Edmond having become captain of the Pharaon	61.01775926448296
Is it possible you were so kind	45.098736125795135
Yes indeed I had previously inquired of Dants what was his opinion of you and if he should have any reluctance to continue you in your post for somehow I have perceived a sort of coolness between you	130.0862822696496
That he certainly did think he had given you offence in an affair which he merely referred to without entering into particulars but that whoever possessed the good opinion and confidence of the ships owners would have his preference also	380.4085828331913
No one can deny his being a noblehearted young fellow	1097.3876711008254
Morrel here is the Pharaon without a captain	214.06433101830405
Oh replied Danglars since we can not leave this port for the next three months let us hope that ere the expiration of that period Dants will be set at liberty	81.28550990317645
No doubt but in the meantime	1165.3288381746288
I am entirely at your service M	49.70710878850507
You know that I am as capable of managing a ship as the most experienced captain in the service and it will be so far advantageous to you to accept my services that upon Edmonds release from prison no further change will be requisite on board the Pharaon than for Dants and myself each to resume our respective posts	280.758634354359
Thanks Danglarsthat will smooth over all difficulties	224.46759114234032
I fully authorize you at once to assume the command of the Pharaon and look carefully to the unloading of her freight	129.7664453089719
Private misfortunes must never be allowed to interfere with business	164.98507051806132
Be easy on that score M	203.20148365315458
Morrel but do you think we shall be permitted to see our poor Edmond	77.76199340343489
I will let you know that directly I have seen M	77.0263371311142
de Villefort whom I shall endeavor to interest in Edmonds favor	443.87356951463903
I am aware he is a furious royalist but in spite of that and of his being kings attorney he is a man like ourselves and I fancy not a bad sort of one	109.63951615295584
Perhaps not replied Danglars but I hear that he is ambitious and that s rather against him	84.51384590262217
But now hasten on board I will join you there ere long	182.70804983720652
So saying the worthy shipowner quitted the two allies and proceeded in the direction of the Palais de Justice	104.26750523314627
You see said Danglars addressing Caderousse the turn things have taken	1047.6258700809274
Do you still feel any desire to stand up in his defence	97.88388777800614
Not the slightest but yet it seems to me a shocking thing that a mere joke should lead to such consequences	168.12848871181365
But who perpetrated that joke let me ask neither you nor myself but Fernand you knew very well that I threw the paper into a corner of the roomindeed I fancied I had destroyed it	103.6777422217372
Oh no replied Caderousse that I can answer for you did not	35.4426712036295
I only wish I could see it now as plainly as I saw it lying all crushed and crumpled in a corner of the arbor	105.73402832627217
Well then if you did depend upon it Fernand picked it up and either copied it or caused it to be copied perhaps even he did not take the trouble of recopying it	179.37158393695483
And now I think of it by Heavens he may have sent the letter itself Fortunately for me the handwriting was disguised	308.68555847609184
Then you were aware of Dants being engaged in a conspiracy	299.2193634032255
As I before said I thought the whole thing was a joke nothing more	154.34594277871483
It seems however that I have unconsciously stumbled upon the truth	408.29263077798106
Still argued Caderousse I would give a great deal if nothing of the kind had happened or at least that I had had no hand in it	84.6339607842057
You will see Danglars that it will turn out an unlucky job for both of us	271.28809583768634
Nonsense If any harm come of it it should fall on the guilty person and that you know is Fernand	84.7383960918038
How can we be implicated in any way All we have got to do is to keep our own counsel and remain perfectly quiet not breathing a word to any living soul and you will see that the storm will pass away without in the least affecting us	131.38468126381144
Amen responded Caderousse waving his hand in token of adieu to Danglars and bending his steps towards the Alles de Meilhan moving his head to and fro and muttering as he went after the manner of one whose mind was overcharged with one absorbing idea	98.01366409301224
So far then said Danglars mentally all has gone as I would have it	245.8746932216054
I am temporarily commander of the Pharaon with the certainty of being permanently so if that fool of a Caderousse can be persuaded to hold his tongue	190.4226792220437
My only fear is the chance of Dants being released	807.0020519661069
But there he is in the hands of Justice and added he with a smile she will take her own	62.05500990398977
So saying he leaped into a boat desiring to be rowed on board the Pharaon where M	151.05325617993898
Morrel had agreed to meet him	2.0854105485241954
In one of the aristocratic mansions built by Puget in the Rue du Grand Cours opposite the Medusa fountain a second marriage feast was being celebrated almost at the same hour with the nuptial repast given by Dants	390.8717500295681
In this case however although the occasion of the entertainment was similar the company was strikingly dissimilar	382.5634327649492
Instead of a rude mixture of sailors soldiers and those belonging to the humblest grade of life the present assembly was composed of the very flower of Marseilles societymagistrates who had resigned their office during the usurpers reign officers who had deserted from the imperial army and joined forces with Cond and younger members of families brought up to hate and execrate the man whom five years of exile would convert into a martyr and fifteen of restoration elevate to the rank of a god	308.30061316414503
The guests were still at table and the heated and energetic conversation that prevailed betrayed the violent and vindictive passions that then agitated each dweller of the South where unhappily for five centuries religious strife had long given increased bitterness to the violence of party feeling	886.8708855597863
The emperor now king of the petty Island of Elba after having held sovereign sway over onehalf of the world counting as his subjects a small population of five or six thousand soulsafter having been accustomed to hear the Vive Napolons of a hundred and twenty millions of human beings uttered in ten different languageswas looked upon here as a ruined man separated forever from any fresh connection with France or claim to her throne	317.1267052352496
The magistrates freely discussed their political views the military part of the company talked unreservedly of Moscow and Leipsic while the women commented on the divorce of Josephine	671.3565639749072
It was not over the downfall of the man but over the defeat of the Napoleonic idea that they rejoiced and in this they foresaw for themselves the bright and cheering prospect of a revivified political existence	540.8730862957242
An old man decorated with the cross of Saint Louis now rose and proposed the health of King Louis XVIII	199.30772751442544
It was the Marquis de SaintMran	22.517754021993973
This toast recalling at once the patient exile of Hartwell and the peaceloving King of France excited universal enthusiasm glasses were elevated in the air   lAnglaise and the ladies snatching their bouquets from their fair bosoms strewed the table with their floral treasures	914.1636313642881
In a word an almost poetical fervor prevailed	15086.107695552144
Ah said the Marquise de SaintMran a woman with a stern forbidding eye though still noble and distinguished in appearance despite her fifty yearsah these revolutionists who have driven us from those very possessions they afterwards purchased for a mere trifle during the Reign of Terror would be compelled to own were they here that all true devotion was on our side since we were content to follow the fortunes of a falling monarch while they on the contrary made their fortune by worshipping the rising sun yes yes they could not help admitting that the king for whom we sacrificed rank wealth and station was truly our Louis the wellbeloved while their wretched usurper has been and ever will be to them their evil genius their Napoleon the accursed	371.5883775902683
I really must pray you to excuse me butin truthI was not attending to the conversation	279.6684447864044
Marquise marquise interposed the old nobleman who had proposed the toast let the young people alone let me tell you on ones wedding day there are more agreeable subjects of conversation than dry politics	356.2309829360483
Never mind dearest mother said a young and lovely girl with a profusion of light brown hair and eyes that seemed to float in liquid crystal tis all my fault for seizing upon M	265.79075498374823
de Villefort so as to prevent his listening to what you said	110.89834920046013
But therenow take himhe is your own for as long as you like	37.16290533979808
Villefort I beg to remind you my mother speaks to you	23.908391893205124
If the marquise will deign to repeat the words I but imperfectly caught I shall be delighted to answer said M	181.99959857360358
Never mind Rene replied the marquise with a look of tenderness that seemed out of keeping with her harsh dry features but however all other feelings may be withered in a womans nature there is always one bright smiling spot in the desert of her heart and that is the shrine of maternal love	184.78083675882294
What I was saying Villefort was that the Bonapartists had not our sincerity enthusiasm or devotion	416.5536970659586
They had however what supplied the place of those fine qualities replied the young man and that was fanaticism	109.96711998087261
Napoleon is the Mahomet of the West and is worshipped by his commonplace but ambitious followers not only as a leader and lawgiver but also as the personification of equality	538.0972053635606
He cried the marquise Napoleon the type of equality For mercys sake then what would you call Robespierre Come come do not strip the latter of his just rights to bestow them on the Corsican who to my mind has usurped quite enough	504.3108015154815
Nay madame I would place each of these heroes on his right pedestalthat of Robespierre on his scaffold in the Place Louis Quinze that of Napoleon on the column of the Place Vendme	455.9480408602657
The only difference consists in the opposite character of the equality advocated by these two men one is the equality that elevates the other is the equality that degrades one brings a king within reach of the guillotine the other elevates the people to a level with the throne	355.5523742256895
Observe said Villefort smiling I do not mean to deny that both these men were revolutionary scoundrels and that the 9th Thermidor and the 4th of April in the year 1814 were lucky days for France worthy of being gratefully remembered by every friend to monarchy and civil order and that explains how it comes to pass that fallen as I trust he is forever Napoleon has still retained a train of parasitical satellites	380.7399346142615
Still marquise it has been so with other usurpersCromwell for instance who was not half so bad as Napoleon had his partisans and advocates	362.6064234507281
Do you know Villefort that you are talking in a most dreadfully revolutionary strain But I excuse it it is impossible to expect the son of a Girondin to be free from a small spice of the old leaven	142.24893639224493
A deep crimson suffused the countenance of Villefort	36.08981112614645
Tis true madame answered he that my father was a Girondin but he was not among the number of those who voted for the kings death he was an equal sufferer with yourself during the Reign of Terror and had wellnigh lost his head on the same scaffold on which your father perished	125.19819735692003
True replied the marquise without wincing in the slightest degree at the tragic remembrance thus called up but bear in mind if you please that our respective parents underwent persecution and proscription from diametrically opposite principles in proof of which I may remark that while my family remained among the staunchest adherents of the exiled princes your father lost no time in joining the new government and that while the Citizen Noirtier was a Girondin the Count Noirtier became a senator	414.81507262140406
Dear mother interposed Rene you know very well it was agreed that all these disagreeable reminiscences should forever be laid aside	182.29827516379152
Suffer me also madame replied Villefort to add my earnest request to Mademoiselle de SaintMrans that you will kindly allow the veil of oblivion to cover and conceal the past	192.94620424646453
What avails recrimination over matters wholly past recall For my own part I have laid aside even the name of my father and altogether disown his political principles	392.6938539106466
He wasnay probably may still bea Bonapartist and is called Noirtier I on the contrary am a staunch royalist and style myself de Villefort	454.71339094520783
Let what may remain of revolutionary sap exhaust itself and die away with the old trunk and condescend only to regard the young shoot which has started up at a distance from the parent tree without having the power any more than the wish to separate entirely from the stock from which it sprung	287.0579674947098
Bravo Villefort cried the marquis excellently well said Come now I have hopes of obtaining what I have been for years endeavoring to persuade the marquise to promise namely a perfect amnesty and forgetfulness of the past	256.7225984978561
With all my heart replied the marquise let the past be forever forgotten	514.9885555149992
I promise you it affords me as little pleasure to revive it as it does you	113.63013540366495
All I ask is that Villefort will be firm and inflexible for the future in his political principles	226.04930511778775
Remember also Villefort that we have pledged ourselves to his majesty for your fealty and strict loyalty and that at our recommendation the king consented to forget the past as I do and here she extended to him her handas I now do at your entreaty	276.73139192672045
But bear in mind that should there fall in your way anyone guilty of conspiring against the government you will be so much the more bound to visit the offence with rigorous punishment as it is known you belong to a suspected family	193.34547193466116
Alas madame returned Villefort my profession as well as the times in which we live compels me to be severe	138.81362166603202
I have already successfully conducted several public prosecutions and brought the offenders to merited punishment	2295.638179343025
But we have not done with the thing yet	196.36061164780264
Do you indeed think so inquired the marquise	544.9362177521602
I am at least fearful of it	13.615392152533545
Napoleon in the Island of Elba is too near France and his proximity keeps up the hopes of his partisans	192.58389490680014
Marseilles is filled with halfpay officers who are daily under one frivolous pretext or other getting up quarrels with the royalists from hence arise continual and fatal duels among the higher classes of persons and assassinations in the lower	867.8598221500922
You have heard perhaps said the Comte de Salvieux one of M	57.72144736105189
de SaintMrans oldest friends and chamberlain to the Comte dArtois that the Holy Alliance purpose removing him from thence	1247.874863081916
Yes they were talking about it when we left Paris said M	49.27480586414683
de SaintMran and where is it decided to transfer him	247.05791049363228
For heavens sake where is that asked the marquise	243.9117846374919
An island situated on the other side of the equator at least two thousand leagues from here replied the count	45.88853610356339
As Villefort observes it is a great act of folly to have left such a man between Corsica where he was born and Naples of which his brotherinlaw is king and face to face with Italy the sovereignty of which he coveted for his son	128.50169796477257
Unfortunately said Villefort there are the treaties of 1814 and we can not molest Napoleon without breaking those compacts	708.6296257852504
Oh well we shall find some way out of it responded M	129.53798109543888
There was nt any trouble over treaties when it was a question of shooting the poor Duc dEnghien	365.12160007103154
Well said the marquise it seems probable that by the aid of the Holy Alliance we shall be rid of Napoleon and we must trust to the vigilance of M	96.03347256444275
de Villefort to purify Marseilles of his partisans	474.279800534856
The king is either a king or no king if he be acknowledged as sovereign of France he should be upheld in peace and tranquillity and this can best be effected by employing the most inflexible agents to put down every attempt at conspiracytis the best and surest means of preventing mischief	414.72985659718466
Unfortunately madame answered Villefort the strong arm of the law is not called upon to interfere until the evil has taken place	100.46066862908374
Then all he has got to do is to endeavor to repair it	132.92560899902
Nay madame the law is frequently powerless to effect this all it can do is to avenge the wrong done	349.6570851786718
de Villefort cried a beautiful young creature daughter to the Comte de Salvieux and the cherished friend of Mademoiselle de SaintMran do try and get up some famous trial while we are at Marseilles	129.8224163453344
I never was in a lawcourt I am told it is so very amusing	238.81505195355274
Amusing certainly replied the young man inasmuch as instead of shedding tears as at the fictitious tale of woe produced at a theatre you behold in a lawcourt a case of real and genuine distressa drama of life	398.4295921469362
The prisoner whom you there see pale agitated and alarmed instead ofas is the case when a curtain falls on a tragedygoing home to sup peacefully with his family and then retiring to rest that he may recommence his mimic woes on the morrowis removed from your sight merely to be reconducted to his prison and delivered up to the executioner	399.9091799272222
I leave you to judge how far your nerves are calculated to bear you through such a scene	228.64043799897448
Of this however be assured that should any favorable opportunity present itself I will not fail to offer you the choice of being present	111.58574254642275
de Villefort said Rene becoming quite pale do nt you see how you are frightening usand yet you laugh	232.44316930100806
What would you have Tis like a duel	134.5669520257937
I have already recorded sentence of death five or six times against the movers of political conspiracies and who can say how many daggers may be ready sharpened and only waiting a favorable opportunity to be buried in my heart	191.74368930777223
de Villefort said Rene becoming more and more terrified you surely are not in earnest	224.69090116632495
Indeed I am replied the young magistrate with a smile and in the interesting trial that young lady is anxious to witness the case would only be still more aggravated	133.78862694688104
Suppose for instance the prisoner as is more than probable to have served under Napoleonwell can you expect for an instant that one accustomed at the word of his commander to rush fearlessly on the very bayonets of his foe will scruple more to drive a stiletto into the heart of one he knows to be his personal enemy than to slaughter his fellowcreatures merely because bidden to do so by one he is bound to obey Besides one requires the excitement of being hateful in the eyes of the accused in order to lash ones self into a state of sufficient vehemence and power	237.00131795130227
I would not choose to see the man against whom I pleaded smile as though in mockery of my words	157.2667436727184
No my pride is to see the accused pale agitated and as though beaten out of all composure by the fire of my eloquence	177.89348393434614
Bravo cried one of the guests that is what I call talking to some purpose	254.1319656852613
Just the person we require at a time like the present said a second	104.534987888488
What a splendid business that last case of yours was my dear Villefort remarked a third I mean the trial of the man for murdering his father	164.30923343906264
Upon my word you killed him ere the executioner had laid his hand upon him	90.54093196234362
Oh as for parricides and such dreadful people as that interposed Rene it matters very little what is done to them but as regards poor unfortunate creatures whose only crime consists in having mixed themselves up in political intrigues	593.1072984801822
Why that is the very worst offence they could possibly commit for do nt you see Rene the king is the father of his people and he who shall plot or contrive aught against the life and safety of the parent of thirtytwo millions of souls is a parricide upon a fearfully great scale	382.57044616686557
I do nt know anything about that replied Rene but M	220.11086309173595
de Villefort you have promised mehave you notalways to show mercy to those I plead for	928.7288579250398
Make yourself quite easy on that point answered Villefort with one of his sweetest smiles you and I will always consult upon our verdicts	193.51558972597854
My love said the marquise attend to your doves your lapdogs and embroidery but do not meddle with what you do not understand	173.1229227593256
Nowadays the military profession is in abeyance and the magisterial robe is the badge of honor	577.5774345433464
There is a wise Latin proverb that is very much in point	198.610759056072
Cedant arma tog said Villefort with a bow	14.594844560112946
I can not speak Latin responded the marquise	1556.7038403800352
Well said Rene I can not help regretting you had not chosen some other profession than your owna physician for instance	288.80544486593783
Do you know I always felt a shudder at the idea of even a destroying angel	197.25232933846002
Dear good Rene whispered Villefort as he gazed with unutterable tenderness on the lovely speaker	150.34416019545353
Let us hope my child cried the marquis that M	64.52661227286148
de Villefort may prove the moral and political physician of this province if so he will have achieved a noble work	425.8669709022267
And one which will go far to efface the recollection of his fathers conduct added the incorrigible marquise	325.9730488414363
Madame replied Villefort with a mournful smile I have already had the honor to observe that my father hasat least I hope soabjured his past errors and that he is at the present moment a firm and zealous friend to religion and ordera better royalist possibly than his son for he has to atone for past dereliction while I have no other impulse than warm decided preference and conviction	249.5010586359926
Having made this wellturned speech Villefort looked carefully around to mark the effect of his oratory much as he would have done had he been addressing the bench in open court	165.80350926330917
Do you know my dear Villefort cried the Comte de Salvieux that is exactly what I myself said the other day at the Tuileries when questioned by his majestys principal chamberlain touching the singularity of an alliance between the son of a Girondin and the daughter of an officer of the Duc de Cond and I assure you he seemed fully to comprehend that this mode of reconciling political differences was based upon sound and excellent principles	174.74187567696407
Then the king who without our suspecting it had overheard our conversation interrupted us by saying Villefortobserve that the king did not pronounce the word Noirtier but on the contrary placed considerable emphasis on that of VillefortVillefort said his majesty is a young man of great judgment and discretion who will be sure to make a figure in his profession I like him much and it gave me great pleasure to hear that he was about to become the soninlaw of the Marquis and Marquise de SaintMran	159.3730938152383
I should myself have recommended the match had not the noble marquis anticipated my wishes by requesting my consent to it	275.13579544970366
Is it possible the king could have condescended so far as to express himself so favorably of me asked the enraptured Villefort	278.78699147233664
I give you his very words and if the marquis chooses to be candid he will confess that they perfectly agree with what his majesty said to him when he went six months ago to consult him upon the subject of your espousing his daughter	156.37990179397858
That is true answered the marquis	806.3802678222528
How much do I owe this gracious prince What is there I would not do to evince my earnest gratitude	248.24417939435526
That is right cried the marquise	5112.652013650413
I love to see you thus	805.7483776785062
Now then were a conspirator to fall into your hands he would be most welcome	51.32006717145418
For my part dear mother interposed Rene I trust your wishes will not prosper and that Providence will only permit petty offenders poor debtors and miserable cheats to fall into M	760.0346585022594
de Villeforts handsthen I shall be contented	107.55241145857208
Just the same as though you prayed that a physician might only be called upon to prescribe for headaches measles and the stings of wasps or any other slight affection of the epidermis	419.19003996915376
If you wish to see me the kings attorney you must desire for me some of those violent and dangerous diseases from the cure of which so much honor redounds to the physician	171.93858424077732
At this moment and as though the utterance of Villeforts wish had sufficed to effect its accomplishment a servant entered the room and whispered a few words in his ear	89.48626040829143
Villefort immediately rose from table and quitted the room upon the plea of urgent business he soon however returned his whole face beaming with delight	195.57522213323728
Rene regarded him with fond affection and certainly his handsome features lit up as they then were with more than usual fire and animation seemed formed to excite the innocent admiration with which she gazed on her graceful and intelligent lover	157.81681019528472
You were wishing just now said Villefort addressing her that I were a doctor instead of a lawyer	101.17177200540381
Well I at least resemble the disciples of Esculapius in one thing people spoke in this style in 1815 that of not being able to call a day my own not even that of my betrothal	180.74973183837736
And wherefore were you called away just now asked Mademoiselle de SaintMran with an air of deep interest	54.19129324969501
For a very serious matter which bids fair to make work for the executioner	470.6291440062737
How dreadful exclaimed Rene turning pale	6.836535832121715
Is it possible burst simultaneously from all who were near enough to the magistrate to hear his words	76.79383828168145
Why if my information prove correct a sort of Bonapartist conspiracy has just been discovered	308.28758096020573
Can I believe my ears cried the marquise	162.1026562610242
I will read you the letter containing the accusation at least said Villefort	202.06104375127552
The kings attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and the religious institutions of his country that one named Edmond Dants mate of the ship Pharaon this day arrived from Smyrna after having touched at Naples and PortoFerrajo has been the bearer of a letter from Murat to the usurper and again taken charge of another letter from the usurper to the Bonapartist club in Paris	72.13092758957916
Ample corroboration of this statement may be obtained by arresting the abovementioned Edmond Dants who either carries the letter for Paris about with him or has it at his fathers abode	112.32851245265631
Should it not be found in the possession of father or son then it will assuredly be discovered in the cabin belonging to the said Dants on board the Pharaon	62.802403581562906
But said Rene this letter which after all is but an anonymous scrawl is not even addressed to you but to the kings attorney	135.78758274535096
True but that gentleman being absent his secretary by his orders opened his letters thinking this one of importance he sent for me but not finding me took upon himself to give the necessary orders for arresting the accused party	250.2211237164137
Then the guilty person is absolutely in custody said the marquise	528.713384780456
Nay dear mother say the accused person	3601.078581731885
You know we can not yet pronounce him guilty	916.3279366219235
He is in safe custody answered Villefort and rely upon it if the letter is found he will not be likely to be trusted abroad again unless he goes forth under the especial protection of the headsman	169.30123112869006
And where is the unfortunate being asked Rene	2004.3109925904698
Come come my friend interrupted the marquise do not neglect your duty to linger with us	131.73467614546584
You are the kings servant and must go wherever that service calls you	388.1436853505739
Oh Villefort cried Rene clasping her hands and looking towards her lover with piteous earnestness be merciful on this the day of our betrothal	176.30960452298848
The young man passed round to the side of the table where the fair pleader sat and leaning over her chair said tenderly	104.20180906895743
To give you pleasure my sweet Rene I promise to show all the lenity in my power but if the charges brought against this Bonapartist hero prove correct why then you really must give me leave to order his head to be cut off	242.4197468119625
Rene shuddered at the word cut for the growth in question had a head	411.01628468340357
Never mind that foolish girl Villefort said the marquise	294.3312294813296
She will soon get over these things	42.36656405383923
So saying Madame de SaintMran extended her dry bony hand to Villefort who while imprinting a soninlaws respectful salute on it looked at Rene as much as to say I must try and fancy tis your dear hand I kiss as it should have been	281.35423386139075
These are mournful auspices to accompany a betrothal sighed poor Rene	2303.9701889507846
Upon my word child exclaimed the angry marquise your folly exceeds all bounds	2565.2221147028727
I should be glad to know what connection there can possibly be between your sickly sentimentality and the affairs of the state	229.3064399710412
Nay madame I pray you pardon this little traitor	577.4808267837453
I promise you that to make up for her want of loyalty I will be most inflexibly severe then casting an expressive glance at his betrothed which seemed to say Fear not for your dear sake my justice shall be tempered with mercy and receiving a sweet and approving smile in return Villefort departed with paradise in his heart	228.79532193444265
No sooner had Villefort left the salon than he assumed the grave air of a man who holds the balance of life and death in his hands	80.9449728103732
Now in spite of the nobility of his countenance the command of which like a finished actor he had carefully studied before the glass it was by no means easy for him to assume an air of judicial severity	168.82501140093876
Except the recollection of the line of politics his father had adopted and which might interfere unless he acted with the greatest prudence with his own career Grard de Villefort was as happy as a man could be	147.6784754434252
Already rich he held a high official situation though only twentyseven	3246.2799879710274
He was about to marry a young and charming woman whom he loved not passionately but reasonably as became a deputy attorney of the king and besides her personal attractions which were very great Mademoiselle de SaintMrans family possessed considerable political influence which they would of course exert in his favor	324.451227654114
The dowry of his wife amounted to fifty thousand crowns and he had besides the prospect of seeing her fortune increased to half a million at her fathers death	98.45689829097782
These considerations naturally gave Villefort a feeling of such complete felicity that his mind was fairly dazzled in its contemplation	167.79107657923456
At the door he met the commissary of police who was waiting for him	23.254063972492265
The sight of this officer recalled Villefort from the third heaven to earth he composed his face as we have before described and said I have read the letter sir and you have acted rightly in arresting this man now inform me what you have discovered concerning him and the conspiracy	159.1182763281369
We know nothing as yet of the conspiracy monsieur all the papers found have been sealed up and placed on your desk	152.95157078533134
The prisoner himself is named Edmond Dants mate on board the threemaster the Pharaon trading in cotton with Alexandria and Smyrna and belonging to Morrel   Son of Marseilles	376.63599097879927
Before he entered the merchant service had he ever served in the marines	562.6835901825523
Oh no monsieur he is very young	396.6551542406765
Nineteen or twenty at the most	143.4072132647474
At this moment and as Villefort had arrived at the corner of the Rue des Conseils a man who seemed to have been waiting for him approached it was M	37.12332072769816
de Villefort cried he I am delighted to see you	24.07923325045997
Some of your people have committed the strangest mistakethey have just arrested Edmond Dants mate of my vessel	646.1297895951609
I know it monsieur replied Villefort and I am now going to examine him	25.90255164892107
Oh said Morrel carried away by his friendship you do not know him and I do	28.793509228164
He is the most estimable the most trustworthy creature in the world and I will venture to say there is not a better seaman in all the merchant service	94.23648831299924
de Villefort I beseech your indulgence for him	299.31264238776066
Villefort as we have seen belonged to the aristocratic party at Marseilles Morrel to the plebeian the first was a royalist the other suspected of Bonapartism	283.75726001679516
Villefort looked disdainfully at Morrel and replied coldly	878.7906761280743
You are aware monsieur that a man may be estimable and trustworthy in private life and the best seaman in the merchant service and yet be politically speaking a great criminal	314.64780423588047
The magistrate laid emphasis on these words as if he wished to apply them to the owner himself while his eyes seemed to plunge into the heart of one who interceding for another had himself need of indulgence	86.67513780787148
Morrel reddened for his own conscience was not quite clear on politics besides what Dants had told him of his interview with the grandmarshal and what the emperor had said to him embarrassed him	162.6454401293684
He replied however in a tone of deep interest	27.79735508026159
de Villefort be as you always are kind and equitable and give him back to us soon	162.82198162648865
This give us sounded revolutionary in the deputys ears	414.7875334073106
Ah ah murmured he is Dants then a member of some Carbonari society that his protector thus employs the collective form He was if I recollect arrested in a tavern in company with a great many others	506.3700949095442
Then he added Monsieur you may rest assured I shall perform my duty impartially and that if he be innocent you shall not have appealed to me in vain should he however be guilty in this present epoch impunity would furnish a dangerous example and I must do my duty	207.9338292652148
As he had now arrived at the door of his own house which adjoined the Palais de Justice he entered after having coldly saluted the shipowner who stood as if petrified on the spot where Villefort had left him	89.40859118208957
The antechamber was full of police agents and gendarmes in the midst of whom carefully watched but calm and smiling stood the prisoner	315.14688713594273
Villefort traversed the antechamber cast a side glance at Dants and taking a packet which a gendarme offered him disappeared saying Bring in the prisoner	282.4092901151341
Rapid as had been Villeforts glance it had served to give him an idea of the man he was about to interrogate	86.36961266801099
He had recognized intelligence in the high forehead courage in the dark eye and bent brow and frankness in the thick lips that showed a set of pearly teeth	282.7338308278661
Villeforts first impression was favorable but he had been so often warned to mistrust first impulses that he applied the maxim to the impression forgetting the difference between the two words	179.30893962013909
He stifled therefore the feelings of compassion that were rising composed his features and sat down grim and sombre at his desk	226.75795632238678
He was pale but calm and collected and saluting his judge with easy politeness looked round for a seat as if he had been in M	108.05624732440214
It was then that he encountered for the first time Villeforts lookthat look peculiar to the magistrate who while seeming to read the thoughts of others betrays nothing of his own	231.88558759074806
Who and what are you demanded Villefort turning over a pile of papers containing information relative to the prisoner that a police agent had given to him on his entry and that already in an hours time had swelled to voluminous proportions thanks to the corrupt espionage of which the accused is always made the victim	216.7516293550047
My name is Edmond Dants replied the young man calmly I am mate of the Pharaon belonging to Messrs	102.0270638458626
What were you doing at the moment you were arrested	50.614039688092504
I was at the festival of my marriage monsieur said the young man his voice slightly tremulous so great was the contrast between that happy moment and the painful ceremony he was now undergoing so great was the contrast between the sombre aspect of M	144.55594204409726
de Villefort and the radiant face of Mercds	62.639515422031764
You were at the festival of your marriage said the deputy shuddering in spite of himself	90.72944648142969
Yes monsieur I am on the point of marrying a young girl I have been attached to for three years	37.22206727953375
Villefort impassive as he was was struck with this coincidence and the tremulous voice of Dants surprised in the midst of his happiness struck a sympathetic chord in his own bosomhe also was on the point of being married and he was summoned from his own happiness to destroy that of another	118.29488622465153
This philosophic reflection thought he will make a great sensation at M	65.3243115512693
de SaintMrans and he arranged mentally while Dants awaited further questions the antithesis by which orators often create a reputation for eloquence	2829.521807618586
When this speech was arranged Villefort turned to Dants	201.1309184892312
What would you have me say	909.2361979695374
Give all the information in your power	39.81587147414571
Tell me on which point you desire information and I will tell all I know only added he with a smile I warn you I know very little	58.195512717228134
Have you served under the usurper	1726.018776303686
I was about to be mustered into the Royal Marines when he fell	620.7734810640505
It is reported your political opinions are extreme said Villefort who had never heard anything of the kind but was not sorry to make this inquiry as if it were an accusation	84.59258512229322
Alas sir I never had any opinions	2846.249057019964
I am hardly nineteen I know nothing I have no part to play	58.5718395803247
If I obtain the situation I desire I shall owe it to M	57.455616876495775
Thus all my opinionsI will not say public but privateare confined to these three sentimentsI love my father I respect M	1049.5087758686882
This sir is all I can tell you and you see how uninteresting it is	52.98132032478567
As Dants spoke Villefort gazed at his ingenuous and open countenance and recollected the words of Rene who without knowing who the culprit was had besought his indulgence for him	248.47371889140692
With the deputys knowledge of crime and criminals every word the young man uttered convinced him more and more of his innocence	114.32410690691215
This lad for he was scarcely a mansimple natural eloquent with that eloquence of the heart never found when sought for full of affection for everybody because he was happy and because happiness renders even the wicked goodextended his affection even to his judge spite of Villeforts severe look and stern accent	601.7083554358287
Pardieu said Villefort he is a noble fellow	24.097526418219598
I hope I shall gain Renes favor easily by obeying the first command she ever imposed on me	906.5410956780422
I shall have at least a pressure of the hand in public and a sweet kiss in private	293.42141053113096
Full of this idea Villeforts face became so joyous that when he turned to Dants the latter who had watched the change on his physiognomy was smiling also	140.30874030588848
Sir said Villefort have you any enemies at least that you know	90.03473779442146
I have enemies replied Dants my position is not sufficiently elevated for that	243.19217504781338
As for my disposition that is perhaps somewhat too hasty but I have striven to repress it	242.38127771339265
I have had ten or twelve sailors under me and if you question them they will tell you that they love and respect me not as a father for I am too young but as an elder brother	103.21068040554098
But you may have excited jealousy	305245.58176766906
You are about to become captain at nineteenan elevated post you are about to marry a pretty girl who loves you and these two pieces of good fortune may have excited the envy of someone	133.4254193585215
You are right you know men better than I do and what you say may possibly be the case I confess but if such persons are among my acquaintances I prefer not to know it because then I should be forced to hate them	102.38926659767394
You are wrong you should always strive to see clearly around you	572.8568454797581
You seem a worthy young man I will depart from the strict line of my duty to aid you in discovering the author of this accusation	85.37360893382966
Here is the paper do you know the writing As he spoke Villefort drew the letter from his pocket and presented it to Dants	31.69617653344542
A cloud passed over his brow as he said	12.99213607498397
No monsieur I do not know the writing and yet it is tolerably plain	108.04214934533215
I am very fortunate added he looking gratefully at Villefort to be examined by such a man as you for this envious person is a real enemy	135.316233956686
And by the rapid glance that the young mans eyes shot forth Villefort saw how much energy lay hid beneath this mildness	255.49465293943234
Now said the deputy answer me frankly not as a prisoner to a judge but as one man to another who takes an interest in him what truth is there in the accusation contained in this anonymous letter And Villefort threw disdainfully on his desk the letter Dants had just given back to him	195.52323061925574
I will tell you the real facts	1245.8021097802352
I swear by my honor as a sailor by my love for Mercds by the life of my father	66.40972305637833
Then internally If Rene could see me I hope she would be satisfied and would no longer call me a decapitator	86.76020316611155
Well when we quitted Naples Captain Leclere was attacked with a brain fever	430.06684890115514
As we had no doctor on board and he was so anxious to arrive at Elba that he would not touch at any other port his disorder rose to such a height that at the end of the third day feeling he was dying he called me to him	82.69688228156075
My dear Dants said he swear to perform what I am going to tell you for it is a matter of the deepest importance	44.12725850833182
Well as after my death the command devolves on you as mate assume the command and bear up for the Island of Elba disembark at PortoFerrajo ask for the grandmarshal give him this letterperhaps they will give you another letter and charge you with a commission	289.3990687393258
You will accomplish what I was to have done and derive all the honor and profit from it	135.7763411427987
I will do it captain but perhaps I shall not be admitted to the grandmarshals presence as easily as you expect	164.431179360451
Here is a ring that will obtain audience of him and remove every difficulty said the captain	341.1845211119859
At these words he gave me a ring	58.10466337504394
It was timetwo hours after he was delirious the next day he died	110.05376078273727
And what did you do then	46.37105294013287
What I ought to have done and what everyone would have done in my place	37.89960883769845
Everywhere the last requests of a dying man are sacred but with a sailor the last requests of his superior are commands	278.94990911205474
I sailed for the Island of Elba where I arrived the next day I ordered everybody to remain on board and went on shore alone	76.47256037628607
As I had expected I found some difficulty in obtaining access to the grandmarshal but I sent the ring I had received from the captain to him and was instantly admitted	152.14362164863877
He questioned me concerning Captain Lecleres death and as the latter had told me gave me a letter to carry on to a person in Paris	121.54589556918823
I undertook it because it was what my captain had bade me do	116.1381404330565
I landed here regulated the affairs of the vessel and hastened to visit my affianced bride whom I found more lovely than ever	165.92522506855005
Morrel all the forms were got over in a word I was as I told you at my marriage feast and I should have been married in an hour and tomorrow I intended to start for Paris had I not been arrested on this charge which you as well as I now see to be unjust	66.73238252561343
Ah said Villefort this seems to me the truth	17.82877274552936
If you have been culpable it was imprudence and this imprudence was in obedience to the orders of your captain	136.40924897235763
Give up this letter you have brought from Elba and pass your word you will appear should you be required and go and rejoin your friends	149.34613024339254
I am free then sir cried Dants joyfully	492.549035854916
Yes but first give me this letter	60.86984801089241
You have it already for it was taken from me with some others which I see in that packet	77.80627179135669
Stop a moment said the deputy as Dants took his hat and gloves	145.7262287774607
To Monsieur Noirtier Rue CoqHron Paris	27.04291454143706
Had a thunderbolt fallen into the room Villefort could not have been more stupefied	39.94320068809514
He sank into his seat and hastily turning over the packet drew forth the fatal letter at which he glanced with an expression of terror	61.252965571206
13 murmured he growing still paler	456.61488445997435
Yes said Dants do you know him	55.9891970851386
No replied Villefort a faithful servant of the king does not know conspirators	142.65192894735074
It is a conspiracy then asked Dants who after believing himself free now began to feel a tenfold alarm	405.6795872284221
I have however already told you sir I was entirely ignorant of the contents of the letter	36.61384764879188
Yes but you knew the name of the person to whom it was addressed said Villefort	27.324722816766695
I was forced to read the address to know to whom to give it	115.6079159171846
Have you shown this letter to anyone asked Villefort becoming still more pale	119.13916251604395
To no one on my honor	7.732126565063038
Everybody is ignorant that you are the bearer of a letter from the Island of Elba and addressed to M	23.674834474770414
Everybody except the person who gave it to me	21.264588867851234
And that was too much far too much murmured Villefort	173.376950735747
Villeforts brow darkened more and more his white lips and clenched teeth filled Dants with apprehension	143.02255044789314
After reading the letter Villefort covered his face with his hands	23.308904162730883
Oh said Dants timidly what is the matter Villefort made no answer but raised his head at the expiration of a few seconds and again perused the letter	61.393234051323084
And you say that you are ignorant of the contents of this letter	31.30315116436053
I give you my word of honor sir said Dants but what is the matter You are illshall I ring for assistanceshall I call	160.63416524959933
No said Villefort rising hastily stay where you are	134.75829079836998
It is for me to give orders here and not you	85.7599907732453
Monsieur replied Dants proudly it was only to summon assistance for you	61.018427686102704
I want none it was a temporary indisposition	1284.1183022802018
Dants waited expecting a question but in vain	55.73707909902891
Villefort fell back on his chair passed his hand over his brow moist with perspiration and for the third time read the letter	24.358292043699024
Oh if he knows the contents of this murmured he and that Noirtier is the father of Villefort I am lost And he fixed his eyes upon Edmond as if he would have penetrated his thoughts	66.27188021604354
Oh it is impossible to doubt it cried he suddenly	249.391747754765
In heavens name cried the unhappy young man if you doubt me question me I will answer you	85.75334294547599
Villefort made a violent effort and in a tone he strove to render firm	72.6914732154675
Sir said he I am no longer able as I had hoped to restore you immediately to liberty before doing so I must consult the trial justice what my own feeling is you already know	217.77256908802673
Oh monsieur cried Dants you have been rather a friend than a judge	70.0757296210558
Well I must detain you some time longer but I will strive to make it as short as possible	90.1968821966434
The principal charge against you is this letter and you see Villefort approached the fire cast it in and waited until it was entirely consumed	184.7273054398877
Oh exclaimed Dants you are goodness itself	20478.926893302654
Listen continued Villefort you can now have confidence in me after what I have done	59.69674485998876
Oh command and I will obey	853.2706962349579
Listen this is not a command but advice I give you	375.55643836690996
Speak and I will follow your advice	32.14163975304921
I shall detain you until this evening in the Palais de Justice	47.59137929665195
Should anyone else interrogate you say to him what you have said to me but do not breathe a word of this letter	40.488555744034144
It was Villefort who seemed to entreat and the prisoner who reassured him	153.45262583496785
You see continued he glancing toward the grate where fragments of burnt paper fluttered in the flames the letter is destroyed you and I alone know of its existence should you therefore be questioned deny all knowledge of itdeny it boldly and you are saved	351.67699879459377
Be satisfied I will deny it	11.626662510584119
It was the only letter you had	37.196605012551835
Villefort whispered some words in his ear to which the officer replied by a motion of his head	85.39011334469991
Follow him said Villefort to Dants	8655.006107034753
Hardly had the door closed when Villefort threw himself halffainting into a chair	75.94583342570401
Alas alas murmured he if the procureur himself had been at Marseilles I should have been ruined	65.88748045103341
This accursed letter would have destroyed all my hopes	89.7960038658765
Oh my father must your past career always interfere with my successes Suddenly a light passed over his face a smile played round his set mouth and his haggard eyes were fixed in thought	205.2104612184231
This will do said he and from this letter which might have ruined me I will make my fortune	60.35817173392669
Now to the work I have in hand	292.54372408655604
And after having assured himself that the prisoner was gone the deputy procureur hastened to the house of his betrothed	99.47510996859617
The commissary of police as he traversed the antechamber made a sign to two gendarmes who placed themselves one on Dants right and the other on his left	89.78610552496511
A door that communicated with the Palais de Justice was opened and they went through a long range of gloomy corridors whose appearance might have made even the boldest shudder	179.85910137780473
The Palais de Justice communicated with the prisona sombre edifice that from its grated windows looks on the clocktower of the Accoules	508.92009235930556
After numberless windings Dants saw a door with an iron wicket	150.6562902608039
The commissary took up an iron mallet and knocked thrice every blow seeming to Dants as if struck on his heart	256.9100305022671
The door opened the two gendarmes gently pushed him forward and the door closed with a loud sound behind him	78.72577689575174
The air he inhaled was no longer pure but thick and mephitiche was in prison	267.7739600077621
He was conducted to a tolerably neat chamber but grated and barred and its appearance therefore did not greatly alarm him besides the words of Villefort who seemed to interest himself so much resounded still in his ears like a promise of freedom	266.1034914582382
It was four oclock when Dants was placed in this chamber	73.74618595542967
It was as we have said the 1st of March and the prisoner was soon buried in darkness	77.06306631134426
The obscurity augmented the acuteness of his hearing at the slightest sound he rose and hastened to the door convinced they were about to liberate him but the sound died away and Dants sank again into his seat	69.69540674802901
At last about ten oclock and just as Dants began to despair steps were heard in the corridor a key turned in the lock the bolts creaked the massy oaken door flew open and a flood of light from two torches pervaded the apartment	157.28532307306182
By the torchlight Dants saw the glittering sabres and carbines of four gendarmes	284.62920149363185
He had advanced at first but stopped at the sight of this display of force	82.28913713538189
Are you come to fetch me asked he	24.239942561813308
By the orders of the deputy procureur	3946.868645028405
The conviction that they came from M	39.030842954886516
de Villefort relieved all Dants apprehensions he advanced calmly and placed himself in the centre of the escort	110.69856208817423
A carriage waited at the door the coachman was on the box and a police officer sat beside him	84.60065986148672
Is this carriage for me said Dants	221.099691226671
It is for you replied a gendarme	236.01251433780772
Dants was about to speak but feeling himself urged forward and having neither the power nor the intention to resist he mounted the steps and was in an instant seated inside between two gendarmes the two others took their places opposite and the carriage rolled heavily over the stones	185.7398520009182
The prisoner glanced at the windowsthey were grated he had changed his prison for another that was conveying him he knew not whither	660.3469116705321
Through the grating however Dants saw they were passing through the Rue Caisserie and by the Rue SaintLaurent and the Rue Taramis to the quay	59.3256867740116
Soon he saw the lights of La Consigne	153.46834335721942
The carriage stopped the officer descended approached the guardhouse a dozen soldiers came out and formed themselves in order Dants saw the reflection of their muskets by the light of the lamps on the quay	159.85417385149384
Can all this force be summoned on my account thought he	90.11067085523196
The officer opened the door which was locked and without speaking a word answered Dants question for he saw between the ranks of the soldiers a passage formed from the carriage to the port	101.71060420247196
The two gendarmes who were opposite to him descended first then he was ordered to alight and the gendarmes on each side of him followed his example	137.95188508134396
They advanced towards a boat which a customhouse officer held by a chain near the quay	306.4196406353795
The soldiers looked at Dants with an air of stupid curiosity	48.90298729177843
In an instant he was placed in the sternsheets of the boat between the gendarmes while the officer stationed himself at the bow a shove sent the boat adrift and four sturdy oarsmen impelled it rapidly towards the Pilon	506.8404402376516
At a shout from the boat the chain that closes the mouth of the port was lowered and in a second they were as Dants knew in the Frioul and outside the inner harbor	274.0199543025663
The prisoners first feeling was of joy at again breathing the pure airfor air is freedom but he soon sighed for he passed before La Rserve where he had that morning been so happy and now through the open windows came the laughter and revelry of a ball	227.42821997149636
Dants folded his hands raised his eyes to heaven and prayed fervently	39.826355580923796
They had passed the Tte de Mort were now off the Anse du Pharo and about to double the battery	286.19166420766965
This manuvre was incomprehensible to Dants	4355.485650226343
Whither are you taking me asked he	25.40958274124128
We are forbidden to give you any explanation	29.607211763415652
Dants trained in discipline knew that nothing would be more absurd than to question subordinates who were forbidden to reply and so he remained silent	137.75670249414404
The most vague and wild thoughts passed through his mind	37.391917992031765
The boat they were in could not make a long voyage there was no vessel at anchor outside the harbor he thought perhaps they were going to leave him on some distant point	178.835502387109
He was not bound nor had they made any attempt to handcuff him this seemed a good augury	266.8941757004874
Besides had not the deputy who had been so kind to him told him that provided he did not pronounce the dreaded name of Noirtier he had nothing to apprehend Had not Villefort in his presence destroyed the fatal letter the only proof against him	125.29033216009285
He waited silently striving to pierce through the darkness	111.43382437037107
They had left the Ile Ratonneau where the lighthouse stood on the right and were now opposite the Point des Catalans	446.30503454359706
It seemed to the prisoner that he could distinguish a feminine form on the beach for it was there Mercds dwelt	179.29858831752708
How was it that a presentiment did not warn Mercds that her lover was within three hundred yards of her	230.58821383106013
One light alone was visible and Dants saw that it came from Mercds chamber	191.96876871519444
Mercds was the only one awake in the whole settlement	392.2292573355387
A loud cry could be heard by her	21.58306438280728
But pride restrained him and he did not utter it	45.65906805931589
What would his guards think if they heard him shout like a madman	232.11860945268114
He remained silent his eyes fixed upon the light the boat went on but the prisoner thought only of Mercds	136.50944909103933
An intervening elevation of land hid the light	187.93472093721783
Dants turned and perceived that they had got out to sea	44.50192846768722
While he had been absorbed in thought they had shipped their oars and hoisted sail the boat was now moving with the wind	327.55467817583997
In spite of his repugnance to address the guards Dants turned to the nearest gendarme and taking his hand	113.92605272825072
Comrade said he I adjure you as a Christian and a soldier to tell me where we are going	46.58405529313466
I am Captain Dants a loyal Frenchman thought accused of treason tell me where you are conducting me and I promise you on my honor I will submit to my fate	91.56870786867741
The gendarme looked irresolutely at his companion who returned for answer a sign that said I see no great harm in telling him now and the gendarme replied	193.9778125935613
You are a native of Marseilles and a sailor and yet you do not know where you are going	32.4839362763397
On my honor I have no idea	60.72357113189867
I swear to you it is true	31.462664128642643
Your orders do not forbid your telling me what I must know in ten minutes in half an hour or an hour	33.784109803032905
You see I can not escape even if I intended	98.29928216032089
Unless you are blind or have never been outside the harbor you must know	116.59271045676245
Dants rose and looked forward when he saw rise within a hundred yards of him the black and frowning rock on which stands the Chteau dIf	219.7414672339316
This gloomy fortress which has for more than three hundred years furnished food for so many wild legends seemed to Dants like a scaffold to a malefactor	208.30813444010568
The Chteau dIf cried he what are we going there for	73.1954615063181
I am not going there to be imprisoned said Dants it is only used for political prisoners	232.70193498074744
Are there any magistrates or judges at the Chteau dIf	136.34876024023586
There are only said the gendarme a governor a garrison turnkeys and good thick walls	2221.752681577131
Come come do not look so astonished or you will make me think you are laughing at me in return for my good nature	76.27589649759409
Dants pressed the gendarmes hand as though he would crush it	43.48874219309335
You think then said he that I am taken to the Chteau dIf to be imprisoned there	75.97374882876548
It is probable but there is no occasion to squeeze so hard	85.69666032235786
Without any inquiry without any formality	1241.3204003986395
All the formalities have been gone through the inquiry is already made	156.73911582504007
And so in spite of M	163.37393928111655
I do not know what M	77.96532015169197
de Villefort promised you said the gendarme but I know we are taking you to the Chteau dIf	72.81012328124528
But what are you doing Help comrades help	20952.80119001447
By a rapid movement which the gendarmes practiced eye had perceived Dants sprang forward to precipitate himself into the sea but four vigorous arms seized him as his feet quitted the bottom of the boat	181.30093558049995
He fell back cursing with rage	34.924765536852966
Good said the gendarme placing his knee on his chest this is the way you keep your word as a sailor Believe softspoken gentlemen again Hark ye my friend I have disobeyed my first order but I will not disobey the second and if you move I will blow your brains out	189.68115670042283
And he levelled his carbine at Dants who felt the muzzle against his temple	357.61125615436987
For a moment the idea of struggling crossed his mind and of so ending the unexpected evil that had overtaken him	307.7899844399843
But he bethought him of M	171.30726976671878
de Villeforts promise and besides death in a boat from the hand of a gendarme seemed too terrible	92.16067813696812
He remained motionless but gnashing his teeth and wringing his hands with fury	60.4498614402892
At this moment the boat came to a landing with a violent shock	102.04673903162612
One of the sailors leaped on shore a cord creaked as it ran through a pulley and Dants guessed they were at the end of the voyage and that they were mooring the boat	122.6307484595465
His guards taking him by the arms and coatcollar forced him to rise and dragged him towards the steps that lead to the gate of the fortress while the police officer carrying a musket with fixed bayonet followed behind	208.97720336086962
Dants made no resistance he was like a man in a dream he saw soldiers drawn up on the embankment he knew vaguely that he was ascending a flight of steps he was conscious that he passed through a door and that the door closed behind him but all this indistinctly as through a mist	124.55758752831171
He did not even see the ocean that terrible barrier against freedom which the prisoners look upon with utter despair	425.7845746635922
They halted for a minute during which he strove to collect his thoughts	87.37025237218303
He looked around he was in a court surrounded by high walls he heard the measured tread of sentinels and as they passed before the light he saw the barrels of their muskets shine	191.3350830839919
They waited upwards of ten minutes	11.461110381728526
Certain Dants could not escape the gendarmes released him	745.2209044942119
Where is the prisoner said a voice	117.7400078640586
Let him follow me I will take him to his cell	48.973881634361405
Go said the gendarmes thrusting Dants forward	2349.5623324844364
The prisoner followed his guide who led him into a room almost under ground whose bare and reeking walls seemed as though impregnated with tears a lamp placed on a stool illumined the apartment faintly and showed Dants the features of his conductor an underjailer illclothed and of sullen appearance	323.30721378627186
Here is your chamber for tonight said he	58.15842953739408
It is late and the governor is asleep	423.95516276371916
Tomorrow perhaps he may change you	26.706293113577424
In the meantime there is bread water and fresh straw and that is all a prisoner can wish for	340.63119860646873
And before Dants could open his mouthbefore he had noticed where the jailer placed his bread or the waterbefore he had glanced towards the corner where the straw was the jailer disappeared taking with him the lamp and closing the door leaving stamped upon the prisoners mind the dim reflection of the dripping walls of his dungeon	184.7840456613769
Dants was alone in darkness and in silencecold as the shadows that he felt breathe on his burning forehead	240.91120528343828
With the first dawn of day the jailer returned with orders to leave Dants where he was	124.61366115355746
He found the prisoner in the same position as if fixed there his eyes swollen with weeping	136.19105419055654
He had passed the night standing and without sleep	292.3174449673679
The jailer advanced Dants appeared not to perceive him	62.876081102445205
He touched him on the shoulder	44.79567639266717
Have you not slept said the jailer	294.6210241468678
I do not know replied Dants	567.912086258718
I wish to see the governor	621.031732250637
The jailer shrugged his shoulders and left the chamber	35.759873878324456
Dants followed him with his eyes and stretched forth his hands towards the open door but the door closed	32.60725635375859
All his emotion then burst forth he cast himself on the ground weeping bitterly and asking himself what crime he had committed that he was thus punished	108.53460047041084
The day passed thus he scarcely tasted food but walked round and round the cell like a wild beast in its cage	259.0423140012546
One thought in particular tormented him namely that during his journey hither he had sat so still whereas he might a dozen times have plunged into the sea and thanks to his powers of swimming for which he was famous have gained the shore concealed himself until the arrival of a Genoese or Spanish vessel escaped to Spain or Italy where Mercds and his father could have joined him	209.7279443547578
He had no fears as to how he should livegood seamen are welcome everywhere	1760.5422696111125
He spoke Italian like a Tuscan and Spanish like a Castilian he would have been free and happy with Mercds and his father whereas he was now confined in the Chteau dIf that impregnable fortress ignorant of the future destiny of his father and Mercds and all this because he had trusted to Villeforts promise	200.53086641138916
The thought was maddening and Dants threw himself furiously down on his straw	121.00329690999916
The next morning at the same hour the jailer came again	123.82642129896686
Well said the jailer are you more reasonable today Dants made no reply	266.50499376689464
Come cheer up is there anything that I can do for you	47.85709710240023
I wish to see the governor	621.031732250637
I have already told you it was impossible	23.53335776054595
Because it is against prison rules and prisoners must not even ask for it	237.82792112420017
Better fare if you pay for it books and leave to walk about	112.7429189408707
I do not want books I am satisfied with my food and do not care to walk about but I wish to see the governor	47.565845769259916
If you worry me by repeating the same thing I will not bring you any more to eat	53.58319216882528
Well then said Edmond if you do not I shall die of hungerthat is all	45.56943643441546
The jailer saw by his tone he would be happy to die and as every prisoner is worth ten sous a day to his jailer he replied in a more subdued tone	106.21770871457247
What you ask is impossible but if you are very well behaved you will be allowed to walk about and some day you will meet the governor and if he chooses to reply that is his affair	86.90672851317483
But asked Dants how long shall I have to wait	66.87876024376506
It is too long a time	36.98198698611217
I wish to see him at once	23.713001703758668
Ah said the jailer do not always brood over what is impossible or you will be mad in a fortnight	103.08362386469537
Yes we have an instance here it was by always offering a million of francs to the governor for his liberty that an abb became mad who was in this chamber before you	127.14689728049345
How long has he left it	56.19223347804173
No he was put in a dungeon	147.74052564819482
I am not an abb I am not mad perhaps I shall be but at present unfortunately I am not	55.125723720072536
I will make you another offer	3352.0158821657787
I do not offer you a million because I have it not but I will give you a hundred crowns if the first time you go to Marseilles you will seek out a young girl named Mercds at the Catalans and give her two lines from me	64.43245492017526
If I took them and were detected I should lose my place which is worth two thousand francs a year so that I should be a great fool to run such a risk for three hundred	84.25870267527203
Well said Dants mark this if you refuse at least to tell Mercds I am here I will some day hide myself behind the door and when you enter I will dash out your brains with this stool	129.68135426133523
Threats cried the jailer retreating and putting himself on the defensive you are certainly going mad	110.43143173836616
The abb began like you and in three days you will be like him mad enough to tie up but fortunately there are dungeons here	188.40628902407178
Dants whirled the stool round his head	16.574853869340398
All right all right said the jailer all right since you will have it so	105.22289038652032
I will send word to the governor	42.63506951327232
Very well returned Dants dropping the stool and sitting on it as if he were in reality mad	80.41633441605947
The jailer went out and returned in an instant with a corporal and four soldiers	115.83625742026624
By the governors orders said he conduct the prisoner to the tier beneath	643.3472208744099
To the dungeon then said the corporal	690.9233118812916
Yes we must put the madman with the madmen	441.1415680674506
The soldiers seized Dants who followed passively	15405.20294079469
He descended fifteen steps and the door of a dungeon was opened and he was thrust in	44.634820658970874
The door closed and Dants advanced with outstretched hands until he touched the wall he then sat down in the corner until his eyes became accustomed to the darkness	54.34203703188768
The jailer was right Dants wanted but little of being utterly mad	357.3021550058084
Villefort had as we have said hastened back to Madame de SaintMrans in the Place du Grand Cours and on entering the house found that the guests whom he had left at table were taking coffee in the salon	73.18376084141734
Rene was with all the rest of the company anxiously awaiting him and his entrance was followed by a general exclamation	92.05409419033796
Well Decapitator Guardian of the State Royalist Brutus what is the matter said one	421.8250237487217
Are we threatened with a fresh Reign of Terror asked another	1475.4024706512719
Has the Corsican ogre broken loose cried a third	1476.2006909967556
Marquise said Villefort approaching his future motherinlaw I request your pardon for thus leaving you	381.4434366251742
Will the marquis honor me by a few moments private conversation	410.4773995022732
Ah it is really a serious matter then asked the marquis remarking the cloud on Villeforts brow	309.7420446631014
So serious that I must take leave of you for a few days so added he turning to Rene judge for yourself if it be not important	103.93651220317997
You are going to leave us cried Rene unable to hide her emotion at this unexpected announcement	136.26589552141493
Where then are you going asked the marquise	94.69063951264653
That madame is an official secret but if you have any commissions for Paris a friend of mine is going there tonight and will with pleasure undertake them	163.38169756458709
The guests looked at each other	1.3238867369678002
You wish to speak to me alone said the marquis	45.892622036660185
Yes let us go to the library please	539.3345862596417
The marquis took his arm and they left the salon	56.88312889293635
Well asked he as soon as they were by themselves tell me what it is	32.82299975808423
An affair of the greatest importance that demands my immediate presence in Paris	375.7520699754891
Now excuse the indiscretion marquis but have you any landed property	356.5338974629568
All my fortune is in the funds seven or eight hundred thousand francs	54.915032787975825
Then sell outsell out marquis or you will lose it all	46.21424727597332
But how can I sell out here	91.01366800958053
You have a broker have you not	10.389241926851685
Then give me a letter to him and tell him to sell out without an instants delay perhaps even now I shall arrive too late	140.69061948202312
The deuce you say replied the marquis let us lose no time then	39.069996155048734
And sitting down he wrote a letter to his broker ordering him to sell out at the market price	210.35339440967454
Now then said Villefort placing the letter in his pocketbook I must have another	48.677376882108696
I dare not write to his majesty	233.27284041546304
I do not ask you to write to his majesty but ask M	116.52191823874662
I want a letter that will enable me to reach the kings presence without all the formalities of demanding an audience that would occasion a loss of precious time	146.39312333548386
But address yourself to the keeper of the seals he has the right of entry at the Tuileries and can procure you audience at any hour of the day or night	115.60921186013898
Doubtless but there is no occasion to divide the honors of my discovery with him	123.01020303876413
The keeper would leave me in the background and take all the glory to himself	124.40049415818324
I tell you marquis my fortune is made if I only reach the Tuileries the first for the king will not forget the service I do him	109.04118206044154
In that case go and get ready	851.7410128024552
I will call Salvieux and make him write the letter	159.9336367397962
Be as quick as possible I must be on the road in a quarter of an hour	17.834524707602807
Tell your coachman to stop at the door	9.885212401993485
You will present my excuses to the marquise and Mademoiselle Rene whom I leave on such a day with great regret	148.3222654855886
You will find them both here and can make your farewells in person	227.19662243513812
A thousand thanksand now for the letter	48.97109205513393
The marquis rang a servant entered	50.058020138093305
Say to the Comte de Salvieux that I would like to see him	78.3329935499116
Now then go said the marquis	358.5406099938179
I shall be gone only a few moments	29.299756698665153
Villefort hastily quitted the apartment but reflecting that the sight of the deputy procureur running through the streets would be enough to throw the whole city into confusion he resumed his ordinary pace	227.35364217373626
At his door he perceived a figure in the shadow that seemed to wait for him	44.02771496531278
It was Mercds who hearing no news of her lover had come unobserved to inquire after him	124.58960068076858
As Villefort drew near she advanced and stood before him	29.62929226131305
Dants had spoken of Mercds and Villefort instantly recognized her	167.47502827383107
Her beauty and high bearing surprised him and when she inquired what had become of her lover it seemed to him that she was the judge and he the accused	81.90526276372056
The young man you speak of said Villefort abruptly is a great criminal and I can do nothing for him mademoiselle	87.3543251802156
Mercds burst into tears and as Villefort strove to pass her again addressed him	281.5651553922273
But at least tell me where he is that I may know whether he is alive or dead said she	65.50655753447056
I do not know he is no longer in my hands replied Villefort	33.20003548296693
And desirous of putting an end to the interview he pushed by her and closed the door as if to exclude the pain he felt	72.85105218709863
But remorse is not thus banished like Virgils wounded hero he carried the arrow in his wound and arrived at the salon Villefort uttered a sigh that was almost a sob and sank into a chair	225.14083836418973
Then the first pangs of an unending torture seized upon his heart	398.16332474794
The man he sacrificed to his ambition that innocent victim immolated on the altar of his fathers faults appeared to him pale and threatening leading his affianced bride by the hand and bringing with him remorse not such as the ancients figured furious and terrible but that slow and consuming agony whose pangs are intensified from hour to hour up to the very moment of death	326.3793900969817
Then he had a moments hesitation	911.8408336046693
He had frequently called for capital punishment on criminals and owing to his irresistible eloquence they had been condemned and yet the slightest shadow of remorse had never clouded Villeforts brow because they were guilty at least he believed so but here was an innocent man whose happiness he had destroyed	211.13710937206062
In this case he was not the judge but the executioner	132.9866590397287
As he thus reflected he felt the sensation we have described and which had hitherto been unknown to him arise in his bosom and fill him with vague apprehensions	169.73137053148272
It is thus that a wounded man trembles instinctively at the approach of the finger to his wound until it be healed but Villeforts was one of those that never close or if they do only close to reopen more agonizing than ever	303.1929417408275
If at this moment the sweet voice of Rene had sounded in his ears pleading for mercy or the fair Mercds had entered and said In the name of God I conjure you to restore me my affianced husband his cold and trembling hands would have signed his release but no voice broke the stillness of the chamber and the door was opened only by Villeforts valet who came to tell him that the travelling carriage was in readiness	153.62890200698507
Villefort rose or rather sprang from his chair hastily opened one of the drawers of his desk emptied all the gold it contained into his pocket stood motionless an instant his hand pressed to his head muttered a few inarticulate sounds and then perceiving that his servant had placed his cloak on his shoulders he sprang into the carriage ordering the postilions to drive to M	79.22953999251544
As the marquis had promised Villefort found the marquise and Rene in waiting	256.3219530060341
He started when he saw Rene for he fancied she was again about to plead for Dants	272.04418331563915
Alas her emotions were wholly personal she was thinking only of Villeforts departure	476.287988029122
She loved Villefort and he left her at the moment he was about to become her husband	39.13800276261914
Villefort knew not when he should return and Rene far from pleading for Dants hated the man whose crime separated her from her lover	499.07057438535224
Meanwhile what of Mercds She had met Fernand at the corner of the Rue de la Loge she had returned to the Catalans and had despairingly cast herself on her couch	56.33797819487494
Fernand kneeling by her side took her hand and covered it with kisses that Mercds did not even feel	67.10188052595507
The lamp went out for want of oil but she paid no heed to the darkness and dawn came but she knew not that it was day	188.22273080093333
Grief had made her blind to all but one objectthat was Edmond	389.5474618785278
Ah you are there said she at length turning towards Fernand	179.48809014597924
I have not quitted you since yesterday returned Fernand sorrowfully	598.0222885357281
Morrel had not readily given up the fight	129.81501607219772
He had learned that Dants had been taken to prison and he had gone to all his friends and the influential persons of the city but the report was already in circulation that Dants was arrested as a Bonapartist agent and as the most sanguine looked upon any attempt of Napoleon to remount the throne as impossible he met with nothing but refusal and had returned home in despair declaring that the matter was serious and that nothing more could be done	145.9087294527124
Caderousse was equally restless and uneasy but instead of seeking like M	195.40281885836242
Morrel to aid Dants he had shut himself up with two bottles of black currant brandy in the hope of drowning reflection	170.48744895599427
But he did not succeed and became too intoxicated to fetch any more drink and yet not so intoxicated as to forget what had happened	156.89173311564122
With his elbows on the table he sat between the two empty bottles while spectres danced in the light of the unsnuffed candlespectres such as Hoffmann strews over his punchdrenched pages like black fantastic dust	443.6764263071467
Danglars alone was content and joyoushe had got rid of an enemy and made his own situation on the Pharaon secure	174.2470193132432
Danglars was one of those men born with a pen behind the ear and an inkstand in place of a heart	184.96661341623766
Everything with him was multiplication or subtraction	4786.725371427574
The life of a man was to him of far less value than a numeral especially when by taking it away he could increase the sum total of his own desires	258.1479245960649
He went to bed at his usual hour and slept in peace	46.46946231366259
de Salvieuxs letter embraced Rene kissed the marquises hand and shaken that of the marquis started for Paris along the Aix road	483.630412198878
Old Dants was dying with anxiety to know what had become of Edmond	101.90262045545042
But we know very well what had become of Edmond	130.5533268729006
The Kings Closet at the Tuileries	504.9905704753057
We will leave Villefort on the road to Paris travellingthanks to trebled feeswith all speed and passing through two or three apartments enter at the Tuileries the little room with the arched window so well known as having been the favorite closet of Napoleon and Louis XVIII	173.94142842265643
There seated before a walnut table he had brought with him from Hartwell and to which from one of those fancies not uncommon to great people he was particularly attached the king Louis XVIII	190.3072437449953
was carelessly listening to a man of fifty or fiftytwo years of age with gray hair aristocratic bearing and exceedingly gentlemanly attire and meanwhile making a marginal note in a volume of Gryphiuss rather inaccurate but much soughtafter edition of Horacea work which was much indebted to the sagacious observations of the philosophical monarch	500.72668017109703
You say sir said the king	497.53849368988784
That I am exceedingly disquieted sire	15563.953119061469
Really have you had a vision of the seven fat kine and the seven lean kine	769.1833870620794
No sire for that would only betoken for us seven years of plenty and seven years of scarcity and with a king as full of foresight as your majesty scarcity is not a thing to be feared	164.14313591440896
Then of what other scourge are you afraid my dear Blacas	203.6092993875656
Sire I have every reason to believe that a storm is brewing in the south	118.4735280038978
Well my dear duke replied Louis XVIII	256.3339159427131
I think you are wrongly informed and know positively that on the contrary it is very fine weather in that direction	128.9307941075142
Man of ability as he was Louis XVIII	97.39728483317383
de Blacas if it only be to reassure a faithful servant will your majesty send into Languedoc Provence and Dauphin trusty men who will bring you back a faithful report as to the feeling in these three provinces	514.2147275065022
Canimus surdis replied the king continuing the annotations in his Horace	892.4485600575256
Sire replied the courtier laughing in order that he might seem to comprehend the quotation your majesty may be perfectly right in relying on the good feeling of France but I fear I am not altogether wrong in dreading some desperate attempt	178.97889125420747
By Bonaparte or at least by his adherents	560.8065314312183
My dear Blacas said the king you with your alarms prevent me from working	212.79946948511204
And you sire prevent me from sleeping with your security	280.0058899343237
Wait my dear sir wait a moment for I have such a delightful note on the Pastor quum traheretwait and I will listen to you afterwards	144.28481479197214
There was a brief pause during which Louis XVIII	67.90101119871252
wrote in a hand as small as possible another note on the margin of his Horace and then looking at the duke with the air of a man who thinks he has an idea of his own while he is only commenting upon the idea of another said	79.93497481221391
Go on my dear duke go onI listen	2352.976676384764
Sire said Blacas who had for a moment the hope of sacrificing Villefort to his own profit I am compelled to tell you that these are not mere rumors destitute of foundation which thus disquiet me but a seriousminded man deserving all my confidence and charged by me to watch over the south the duke hesitated as he pronounced these words has arrived by post to tell me that a great peril threatens the king and so I hastened to you sire	198.15118461828
Mala ducis avi domum continued Louis XVIII	115.03429681975018
Does your majesty wish me to drop the subject	82.04686738727663
By no means my dear duke but just stretch out your hand	369.6539289746015
Whichever you pleasethere to the left	809.2908813583067
I tell you to the left and you are looking to the right I mean on my leftyes there	117.35342792918868
You will find yesterdays report of the minister of police	20.54421089772675
Dandr announced by the chamberlaininwaiting entered	1690.376954230513
with repressed smile come in Baron and tell the duke all you knowthe latest news of M	682.9207701560399
de Bonaparte do not conceal anything however seriouslet us see the Island of Elba is a volcano and we may expect to have issuing thence flaming and bristling warbella horrida bella	788.6124705215937
Dandr leaned very respectfully on the back of a chair with his two hands and said	30.970985901090142
Has your majesty perused yesterdays report	9981.202973335003
Yes yes but tell the duke himself who can not find anything what the report containsgive him the particulars of what the usurper is doing in his islet	143.695026722192
Monsieur said the baron to the duke all the servants of his majesty must approve of the latest intelligence which we have from the Island of Elba	101.76149348855824
who employed in writing a note did not even raise his head	99.74899130192772
Bonaparte continued the baron is mortally wearied and passes whole days in watching his miners at work at PortoLongone	1227.307240365773
And scratches himself for amusement added the king	168.30406223559785
Scratches himself inquired the duke what does your majesty mean	111.50669403028618
Did you forget that this great man this hero this demigod is attacked with a malady of the skin which worries him to death prurigo	446.4281951694406
And moreover my dear duke continued the minister of police we are almost assured that in a very short time the usurper will be insane	87.62889603319248
Raving mad his head becomes weaker	59064.89426172958
Sometimes he weeps bitterly sometimes laughs boisterously at other time he passes hours on the seashore flinging stones in the water and when the flint makes duckanddrake five or six times he appears as delighted as if he had gained another Marengo or Austerlitz	465.26758757331214
Now you must agree that these are indubitable symptoms of insanity	924.0474704042408
Or of wisdom my dear baronor of wisdom said Louis XVIII	663.04233894742
laughing the greatest captains of antiquity amused themselves by casting pebbles into the oceansee Plutarchs life of Scipio Africanus	1958.1271755538166
de Blacas pondered deeply between the confident monarch and the truthful minister	1014.4191970077071
Villefort who did not choose to reveal the whole secret lest another should reap all the benefit of the disclosure had yet communicated enough to cause him the greatest uneasiness	241.73493932242175
Well well Dandr said Louis XVIII	1.7497431130261967
Blacas is not yet convinced let us proceed therefore to the usurpers conversion	569.7926339103672
The usurpers conversion murmured the duke looking at the king and Dandr who spoke alternately like Virgils shepherds	619.4995159898032
Tell him all about it baron	27439.633590580033
Why this is the way of it said the minister with the gravest air in the world Napoleon lately had a review and as two or three of his old veterans expressed a desire to return to France he gave them their dismissal and exhorted them to serve the good king	164.56565503291498
These were his own words of that I am certain	36.66094561001649
Well Blacas what think you of this inquired the king triumphantly and pausing for a moment from the voluminous scholiast before him	274.4208620189034
I say sire that the minister of police is greatly deceived or I am and as it is impossible it can be the minister of police as he has the guardianship of the safety and honor of your majesty it is probable that I am in error	71.2999806675182
However sire if I might advise your majesty will interrogate the person of whom I spoke to you and I will urge your majesty to do him this honor	70.70027376971154
Most willingly duke under your auspices I will receive any person you please but you must not expect me to be too confiding	132.58679697485843
Baron have you any report more recent than this dated the 20th February and this is the 3rd of March	244.14938980441963
No sire but I am hourly expecting one it may have arrived since I left my office	225.7095326111868
Go thither and if there be nonewell well continued Louis XVIII	685.9252199882947
make one that is the usual way is it not and the king laughed facetiously	547.1041684626664
Oh sire replied the minister we have no occasion to invent any every day our desks are loaded with most circumstantial denunciations coming from hosts of people who hope for some return for services which they seek to render but can not they trust to fortune and rely upon some unexpected event in some way to justify their predictions	349.63155303317166
Well sir go said Louis XVIII	1.2156293490693955
and remember that I am waiting for you	33.49570527848229
I will but go and return sire I shall be back in ten minutes	79.01751866283223
de Blacas will go and find my messenger	277.7242063667302
Wait sir wait said Louis XVIII	1.948979934443939
de Blacas I must change your armorial bearings I will give you an eagle with outstretched wings holding in its claws a prey which tries in vain to escape and bearing this deviceTenax	263.50021213850954
Sire I listen said De Blacas biting his nails with impatience	316.91977896845447
I wish to consult you on this passage Molli fugiens anhelitu you know it refers to a stag flying from a wolf	1222.849777584495
Are you not a sportsman and a great wolfhunter Well then what do you think of the molli anhelitu	246.32921630489398
Admirable sire but my messenger is like the stag you refer to for he has posted two hundred and twenty leagues in scarcely three days	221.9170039234641
Which is undergoing great fatigue and anxiety my dear duke when we have a telegraph which transmits messages in three or four hours and that without getting in the least out of breath	180.25808136344094
Ah sire you recompense but badly this poor young man who has come so far and with so much ardor to give your majesty useful information	142.3524909812399
If only for the sake of M	10.41183445143104
de Salvieux who recommends him to me I entreat your majesty to receive him graciously	82.31129553445452
Does he speak to you of this conspiracy	335.84273494994346
de Villefort and begs me to present him to your majesty	38.309259647705886
de Villefort cried the king is the messengers name M	536.885200444095
Why did you not mention his name at once replied the king betraying some uneasiness	178.72504188871642
Sire I thought his name was unknown to your majesty	110.22730485648638
No no Blacas he is a man of strong and elevated understanding ambitious too and pardieu you know his fathers name	323.6723875816162
And your majesty has employed the son of such a man	19.10408823127767
Blacas my friend you have but limited comprehension	9640.975546568243
I told you Villefort was ambitious and to attain this ambition Villefort would sacrifice everything even his father	371.9430629746009
Then sire may I present him	37.81906927804464
This instant duke Where is he	17.087092513624487
The duke left the royal presence with the speed of a young man his really sincere royalism made him youthful again	239.08968745306382
remained alone and turning his eyes on his halfopened Horace muttered	726.500255963751
de Blacas returned as speedily as he had departed but in the antechamber he was forced to appeal to the kings authority	61.0497570153665
Villeforts dusty garb his costume which was not of courtly cut excited the susceptibility of M	289.79172145135976
de Brez who was all astonishment at finding that this young man had the audacity to enter before the king in such attire	120.23638325583306
The duke however overcame all difficulties with a wordhis majestys order and in spite of the protestations which the master of ceremonies made for the honor of his office and principles Villefort was introduced	201.17657525760117
The king was seated in the same place where the duke had left him	27.990409483961113
On opening the door Villefort found himself facing him and the young magistrates first impulse was to pause	308.5348622423278
de Villefort said the king come in	231.3924994189345
Villefort bowed and advancing a few steps waited until the king should interrogate him	200.21090486273621
the Duc de Blacas assures me you have some interesting information to communicate	109.25667126649888
Sire the duke is right and I believe your majesty will think it equally important	131.96988119594704
In the first place and before everything else sir is the news as bad in your opinion as I am asked to believe	120.81507187874807
Sire I believe it to be most urgent but I hope by the speed I have used that it is not irreparable	121.73912002329568
Speak as fully as you please sir said the king who began to give way to the emotion which had showed itself in Blacass face and affected Villeforts voice	112.16886038174061
Speak sir and pray begin at the beginning I like order in everything	271.20389722480655
Sire said Villefort I will render a faithful report to your majesty but I must entreat your forgiveness if my anxiety leads to some obscurity in my language	195.566965822775
A glance at the king after this discreet and subtle exordium assured Villefort of the benignity of his august auditor and he went on	587.1006509480329
Sire I have come as rapidly to Paris as possible to inform your majesty that I have discovered in the exercise of my duties not a commonplace and insignificant plot such as is every day got up in the lower ranks of the people and in the army but an actual conspiracya storm which menaces no less than your majestys throne	191.5633039748504
Sire the usurper is arming three ships he meditates some project which however mad is yet perhaps terrible	689.367408415697
At this moment he will have left Elba to go whither I know not but assuredly to attempt a landing either at Naples or on the coast of Tuscany or perhaps on the shores of France	145.39909952045025
Your majesty is well aware that the sovereign of the Island of Elba has maintained his relations with Italy and France	67.89258769481789
I am sir said the king much agitated and recently we have had information that the Bonapartist clubs have had meetings in the Rue SaintJacques	294.0190820745832
But proceed I beg of you	2.068798101978276
How did you obtain these details	51.930193743995154
Sire they are the results of an examination which I have made of a man of Marseilles whom I have watched for some time and arrested on the day of my departure	50.888750145254456
This person a sailor of turbulent character and whom I suspected of Bonapartism has been secretly to the Island of Elba	168.83064306751598
There he saw the grandmarshal who charged him with an oral message to a Bonapartist in Paris whose name I could not extract from him but this mission was to prepare mens minds for a return it is the man who says this sirea return which will soon occur	172.4830890018001
And the matter seems serious to you	14.98753008654097
So serious sire that when the circumstance surprised me in the midst of a family festival on the very day of my betrothal I left my bride and friends postponing everything that I might hasten to lay at your majestys feet the fears which impressed me and the assurance of my devotion	145.44967109449735
was there not a marriage engagement between you and Mademoiselle de SaintMran	65.55928332770823
Daughter of one of your majestys most faithful servants	755.837174561341
Yes yes but let us talk of this plot M	62.9470888620298
Sire I fear it is more than a plot I fear it is a conspiracy	87.04363772407264
A conspiracy in these times said Louis XVIII	69.74310122385975
smiling is a thing very easy to meditate but more difficult to conduct to an end inasmuch as reestablished so recently on the throne of our ancestors we have our eyes open at once upon the past the present and the future	211.31509667421506
For the last ten months my ministers have redoubled their vigilance in order to watch the shore of the Mediterranean	161.61145954477632
If Bonaparte landed at Naples the whole coalition would be on foot before he could even reach Piombino if he land in Tuscany he will be in an unfriendly territory if he land in France it must be with a handful of men and the result of that is easily foretold execrated as he is by the population	209.1753345996313
Take courage sir but at the same time rely on our royal gratitude	68.13808085213046
At this instant the minister of police appeared at the door pale trembling and as if ready to faint	49.01021682696578
Villefort was about to retire but M	184.2258047130215
de Blacas taking his hand restrained him	598.602284104587
At the sight of this agitation Louis XVIII	300.6202915675229
pushed from him violently the table at which he was sitting	72.64939827246947
What ails you baron he exclaimed	99.50238160331925
Has your uneasiness anything to do with what M	33.29619499233307
de Blacas has told me and M	95.87132021667028
de Villefort has just confirmed M	526.844682298709
de Blacas moved suddenly towards the baron but the fright of the courtier pleaded for the forbearance of the statesman and besides as matters were it was much more to his advantage that the prefect of police should triumph over him than that he should humiliate the prefect	204.94002070367458
Well what is it asked Louis XVIII	254.02909900080573
The minister of police giving way to an impulse of despair was about to throw himself at the feet of Louis XVIII	41.57707359722703
who retreated a step and frowned	114016.6978716587
Oh sire what a dreadful misfortune I am indeed to be pitied	40.48850659689611
Well sire the usurper left Elba on the 26th February and landed on the 1st of March	139.8043575449419
And where In Italy asked the king eagerly	124.383817307324
In France sireat a small port near Antibes in the Gulf of Juan	522.3353862687337
The usurper landed in France near Antibes in the Gulf of Juan two hundred and fifty leagues from Paris on the 1st of March and you only acquired this information today the 3rd of March Well sir what you tell me is impossible	117.53142957655656
You must have received a false report or you have gone mad	147.43291485430214
Alas sire it is but too true Louis made a gesture of indescribable anger and alarm and then drew himself up as if this sudden blow had struck him at the same moment in heart and countenance	81.26790033362681
In France he cried the usurper in France Then they did not watch over this man	197.95342340916193
Who knows they were perhaps in league with him	133.90251986330702
Oh sire exclaimed the Duc de Blacas M	94.78287353161626
Dandr is not a man to be accused of treason Sire we have all been blind and the minister of police has shared the general blindness that is all	202.0968791716814
But said Villefort and then suddenly checking himself he was silent then he continued Your pardon sire he said bowing my zeal carried me away	392.28159635276506
Will your majesty deign to excuse me	57.24456162443795
Speak sir speak boldly replied Louis	9167.489989443073
You alone forewarned us of the evil now try and aid us with the remedy	235.68724620841084
Sire said Villefort the usurper is detested in the south and it seems to me that if he ventured into the south it would be easy to raise Languedoc and Provence against him	105.5439597483515
Yes assuredly replied the minister but he is advancing by Gap and Sisteron	289.2881666898131
Advancinghe is advancing said Louis XVIII	2.4860859346219564
Is he then advancing on Paris The minister of police maintained a silence which was equivalent to a complete avowal	395.26259982081507
And Dauphin sir inquired the king of Villefort	61.34883337150667
Do you think it possible to rouse that as well as Provence	226.12913645339341
Sire I am sorry to tell your majesty a cruel fact but the feeling in Dauphin is quite the reverse of that in Provence or Languedoc	459.96682219794064
Then murmured Louis he was well informed	392.8644837743255
And how many men had he with him	243.7677238127652
I do not know sire answered the minister of police	48.50810928122219
What you do not know Have you neglected to obtain information on that point Of course it is of no consequence he added with a withering smile	191.0023822421967
Sire it was impossible to learn the despatch simply stated the fact of the landing and the route taken by the usurper	180.81750552751623
And how did this despatch reach you inquired the king	208.62205054870952
The minister bowed his head and while a deep color overspread his cheeks he stammered out	154.64912126574512
advanced a step and folded his arms over his chest as Napoleon would have done	43.719904052013405
So then he exclaimed turning pale with anger seven conjoined and allied armies overthrew that man	915.3530930228586
A miracle of heaven replaced me on the throne of my fathers after fiveandtwenty years of exile	115.10381838332316
I have during those fiveandtwenty years spared no pains to understand the people of France and the interests which were confided to me and now when I see the fruition of my wishes almost within reach the power I hold in my hands bursts and shatters me to atoms	146.64408848473389
Sire it is fatality murmured the minister feeling that the pressure of circumstances however light a thing to destiny was too much for any human strength to endure	238.39513906462892
What our enemies say of us is then true	200.7821209065756
We have learnt nothing forgotten nothing If I were betrayed as he was I would console myself but to be in the midst of persons elevated by myself to places of honor who ought to watch over me more carefully than over themselvesfor my fortune is theirsbefore me they were nothingafter me they will be nothing and perish miserably from incapacityineptitude Oh yes sir you are rightit is fatality	269.1980111289739
The minister quailed before this outburst of sarcasm	3517.652697278273
de Blacas wiped the moisture from his brow	7.336735973467969
Villefort smiled within himself for he felt his increased importance	360.6917309237987
To fall continued King Louis who at the first glance had sounded the abyss on which the monarchy hung suspendedto fall and learn of that fall by telegraph Oh I would rather mount the scaffold of my brother Louis XVI	342.2421754994189
than thus descend the staircase at the Tuileries driven away by ridicule	321.3801411921125
Ridicule sirwhy you know not its power in France and yet you ought to know it	34.87995429792969
Sire sire murmured the minister for pitys	1891.791199140409
de Villefort resumed the king addressing the young man who motionless and breathless was listening to a conversation on which depended the destiny of a kingdom	99.4616961347453
Approach and tell monsieur that it is possible to know beforehand all that he has not known	57.21948377845784
Sire it was really impossible to learn secrets which that man concealed from all the world	179.2099581700846
Really impossible Yesthat is a great word sir	181.78251549644298
Unfortunately there are great words as there are great men I have measured them	137.05901506972037
Really impossible for a minister who has an office agents spies and fifteen hundred thousand francs for secret service money to know what is going on at sixty leagues from the coast of France Well then see here is a gentleman who had none of these resources at his disposala gentleman only a simple magistrate who learned more than you with all your police and who would have saved my crown if like you he had the power of directing a telegraph	144.99712889042127
The look of the minister of police was turned with concentrated spite on Villefort who bent his head in modest triumph	266.250975790311
I do not mean that for you Blacas continued Louis XVIII	575.9969853108253
for if you have discovered nothing at least you have had the good sense to persevere in your suspicions	130.894885996874
Any other than yourself would have considered the disclosure of M	36.326893212588246
de Villefort insignificant or else dictated by venal ambition	3486.8071450950347
These words were an allusion to the sentiments which the minister of police had uttered with so much confidence an hour before	62.18605390191941
Any other person would perhaps have been overcome by such an intoxicating draught of praise but he feared to make for himself a mortal enemy of the police minister although he saw that Dandr was irrevocably lost	171.00888520312054
In fact the minister who in the plenitude of his power had been unable to unearth Napoleons secret might in despair at his own downfall interrogate Dants and so lay bare the motives of Villeforts plot	446.73087247391595
Realizing this Villefort came to the rescue of the crestfallen minister instead of aiding to crush him	320.4272455185385
Sire said Villefort the suddenness of this event must prove to your majesty that the issue is in the hands of Providence what your majesty is pleased to attribute to me as profound perspicacity is simply owing to chance and I have profited by that chance like a good and devoted servantthats all	174.86252481169794
Do not attribute to me more than I deserve sire that your majesty may never have occasion to recall the first opinion you have been pleased to form of me	109.04520580630823
The minister of police thanked the young man by an eloquent look and Villefort understood that he had succeeded in his design that is to say that without forfeiting the gratitude of the king he had made a friend of one on whom in case of necessity he might rely	69.37211275246335
And now gentlemen he continued turning towards M	122.23851359268217
de Blacas and the minister of police I have no further occasion for you and you may retire what now remains to do is in the department of the minister of war	65.56451746598438
de Blacas we can rely on the army your majesty knows how every report confirms their loyalty and attachment	472.5704256455452
Do not mention reports duke to me for I know now what confidence to place in them	109.7506674493754
Yet speaking of reports baron what have you learned with regard to the affair in the Rue SaintJacques	50.741066394830405
The affair in the Rue SaintJacques exclaimed Villefort unable to repress an exclamation	150.0414503142568
Then suddenly pausing he added Your pardon sire but my devotion to your majesty has made me forget not the respect I have for that is too deeply engraved in my heart but the rules of etiquette	139.38618916134163
Go on go on sir replied the king you have today earned the right to make inquiries here	126.13657188628493
Sire interposed the minister of police I came a moment ago to give your majesty fresh information which I had obtained on this head when your majestys attention was attracted by the terrible event that has occurred in the gulf and now these facts will cease to interest your majesty	137.07824925679992
On the contrary siron the contrary said Louis XVIII	327.4648832663683
this affair seems to me to have a decided connection with that which occupies our attention and the death of General Quesnel will perhaps put us on the direct track of a great internal conspiracy	311.91279507190296
At the name of General Quesnel Villefort trembled	1784.6871256431536
Everything points to the conclusion sire said the minister of police that death was not the result of suicide as we first believed but of assassination	150.66988631365987
General Quesnel it appears had just left a Bonapartist club when he disappeared	183.29775428538687
An unknown person had been with him that morning and made an appointment with him in the Rue SaintJacques unfortunately the generals valet who was dressing his hair at the moment when the stranger entered heard the street mentioned but did not catch the number	120.15572841774092
As the police minister related this to the king Villefort who looked as if his very life hung on the speakers lips turned alternately red and pale	193.41804417893917
Do you not think with me M	24.200074460295017
de Villefort that General Quesnel whom they believed attached to the usurper but who was really entirely devoted to me has perished the victim of a Bonapartist ambush	157.52263453597064
It is probable sire replied Villefort	19.12186351300727
But is this all that is known	107.56472055958812
They are on the track of the man who appointed the meeting with him	50.70590423116857
Yes the servant has given his description	755.2650581313308
He is a man of from fifty to fiftytwo years of age dark with black eyes covered with shaggy eyebrows and a thick moustache	163.89478383563025
He was dressed in a blue frockcoat buttoned up to the chin and wore at his buttonhole the rosette of an officer of the Legion of Honor	61.76039757294455
Yesterday a person exactly corresponding with this description was followed but he was lost sight of at the corner of the Rue de la Jussienne and the Rue CoqHron	41.606327332796766
Villefort leaned on the back of an armchair for as the minister of police went on speaking he felt his legs bend under him but when he learned that the unknown had escaped the vigilance of the agent who followed him he breathed again	83.86156323772138
Continue to seek for this man sir said the king to the minister of police for if as I am all but convinced General Quesnel who would have been so useful to us at this moment has been murdered his assassins Bonapartists or not shall be cruelly punished	141.58345642177926
It required all Villeforts coolness not to betray the terror with which this declaration of the king inspired him	137.33615714874176
How strange continued the king with some asperity the police think that they have disposed of the whole matter when they say A murder has been committed and especially so when they can add And we are on the track of the guilty persons	136.61351617695308
Sire your majesty will I trust be amply satisfied on this point at least	204.984922759245
I will no longer detain you M	55.44239535161961
de Villefort for you must be fatigued after so long a journey go and rest	144.78988675533995
Of course you stopped at your fathers A feeling of faintness came over Villefort	276.4781656632152
No sire he replied I alighted at the Hotel de Madrid in the Rue de Tournon	86.44848125238241
Sire I went straight to the Duc de Blacas	59.448638398176584
But you will see him then	48.573904533597364
Ah I forgot said Louis smiling in a manner which proved that all these questions were not made without a motive I forgot you and M	61.376103254195584
Noirtier are not on the best terms possible and that is another sacrifice made to the royal cause and for which you should be recompensed	203.99315621822083
Sire the kindness your majesty deigns to evince towards me is a recompense which so far surpasses my utmost ambition that I have nothing more to ask for	186.2770456161865
Never mind sir we will not forget you make your mind easy	120.51187373468973
In the meanwhile the king here detached the cross of the Legion of Honor which he usually wore over his blue coat near the cross of St	100.76173061901218
Louis above the order of NotreDameduMontCarmel and St	2667.2925686102985
Lazare and gave it to Villefortin the meanwhile take this cross	1787.8691723841594
Sire said Villefort your majesty mistakes this is an officers cross	1151.333795635078
take it such as it is for I have not the time to procure you another	37.07576109585604
Blacas let it be your care to see that the brevet is made out and sent to M	120.50450413285546
Villeforts eyes were filled with tears of joy and pride he took the cross and kissed it	42.44100833977715
And now he said may I inquire what are the orders with which your majesty deigns to honor me	183.23055512156202
Take what rest you require and remember that if you are not able to serve me here in Paris you may be of the greatest service to me at Marseilles	64.66561146728141
Sire replied Villefort bowing in an hour I shall have quitted Paris	57.36376289262493
Go sir said the king and should I forget you kings memories are short do not be afraid to bring yourself to my recollection	206.5595260300325
Baron send for the minister of war	79.87142240834503
Ah sir said the minister of police to Villefort as they left the Tuileries you entered by lucks dooryour fortune is made	337.5448884676977
Will it be long first muttered Villefort saluting the minister whose career was ended and looking about him for a hackneycoach	217.64111629057916
One passed at the moment which he hailed he gave his address to the driver and springing in threw himself on the seat and gave loose to dreams of ambition	220.44658324327062
Ten minutes afterwards Villefort reached his hotel ordered horses to be ready in two hours and asked to have his breakfast brought to him	100.82233887964803
He was about to begin his repast when the sound of the bell rang sharp and loud	92.89365626601739
The valet opened the door and Villefort heard someone speak his name	124.0512669617536
Who could know that I was here already said the young man	27.434873148446155
Well said Villefort what is itWho rangWho asked for me	1130.3339858210493
A stranger who will not send in his name	72.51149133189931
A stranger who will not send in his name What can he want with me	97.12264022259752
He wishes to speak to you	5.434284168569029
What sort of person is he	52.12506591087253
Why sir a man of about fifty	140.54249668990127
Darkvery dark with black eyes black hair black eyebrows	9.213615657685626
And how dressed asked Villefort quickly	82.43988167036288
In a blue frockcoat buttoned up close decorated with the Legion of Honor	51.66906833038037
It is he said Villefort turning pale	54.26927532188097
Eh pardieu said the individual whose description we have twice given entering the door what a great deal of ceremony Is it the custom in Marseilles for sons to keep their fathers waiting in their anterooms	231.99057877556132
Father cried Villefort then I was not deceived I felt sure it must be you	54.24867483516712
Well then if you felt so sure replied the newcomer putting his cane in a corner and his hat on a chair allow me to say my dear Grard that it was not very filial of you to keep me waiting at the door	66.31648048107057
The servant quitted the apartment with evident signs of astonishment	155.77359958489188
Noirtierfor it was indeed he who enteredlooked after the servant until the door was closed and then fearing no doubt that he might be overheard in the antechamber he opened the door again nor was the precaution useless as appeared from the rapid retreat of Germain who proved that he was not exempt from the sin which ruined our first parents	127.6485835588231
Noirtier then took the trouble to close and bolt the antechamber door then that of the bedchamber and then extended his hand to Villefort who had followed all his motions with surprise which he could not conceal	88.7627545555352
Well now my dear Grard said he to the young man with a very significant look do you know you seem as if you were not very glad to see me	39.72829135032388
My dear father said Villefort I am on the contrary delighted but I so little expected your visit that it has somewhat overcome me	148.93845061347102
But my dear fellow replied M	122.92623655283197
Noirtier seating himself I might say the same thing to you when you announce to me your wedding for the 28th of February and on the 3rd of March you turn up here in Paris	74.70863405124018
And if I have come my dear father said Grard drawing closer to M	197.3078325801288
Noirtier do not complain for it is for you that I came and my journey will be your salvation	69.97809129800973
Noirtier stretching himself out at his ease in the chair	42.70433661382916
Really pray tell me all about it for it must be interesting	44.6167528168505
Father you have heard speak of a certain Bonapartist club in the Rue SaintJacques	78.24864248769525
Father your coolness makes me shudder	406.8716237788899
Why my dear boy when a man has been proscribed by the mountaineers has escaped from Paris in a haycart been hunted over the plains of Bordeaux by Robespierres bloodhounds he becomes accustomed to most things	361.0272747739441
But go on what about the club in the Rue SaintJacques	36.85582731144673
Why they induced General Quesnel to go there and General Quesnel who quitted his own house at nine oclock in the evening was found the next day in the Seine	60.50341214774944
And who told you this fine story	338.1056083256313
Well then in return for your story continued Noirtier I will tell you another	75.35596360159153
My dear father I think I already know what you are about to tell me	27.89655463651248
Ah you have heard of the landing of the emperor	35.893152317720045
Not so loud father I entreat of youfor your own sake as well as mine	157.45561308872126
Yes I heard this news and knew it even before you could for three days ago I posted from Marseilles to Paris with all possible speed halfdesperate at the enforced delay	194.55589519902895
Three days ago You are crazy	30510.805594536927
Why three days ago the emperor had not landed	130.91007614701607
No matter I was aware of his intention	22.33856550540365
How did you know about it	10.296563882916319
By a letter addressed to you from the Island of Elba	17.11231876019657
To you and which I discovered in the pocketbook of the messenger	68.39936987108196
Had that letter fallen into the hands of another you my dear father would probably ere this have been shot	88.45764453610882
Come come said he will the Restoration adopt imperial methods so promptly Shot my dear boy What an idea Where is the letter you speak of I know you too well to suppose you would allow such a thing to pass you	228.70656816569914
I burnt it for fear that even a fragment should remain for that letter must have led to your condemnation	194.71020899120313
And the destruction of your future prospects replied Noirtier yes I can easily comprehend that	218.53192827041178
But I have nothing to fear while I have you to protect me	56.107700885404114
I do better than that sirI save you	2219.7717719511
You do Why really the thing becomes more and more dramaticexplain yourself	501.19769332444235
I must refer again to the club in the Rue SaintJacques	25.138971609644866
It appears that this club is rather a bore to the police	205.24836729514075
Why did nt they search more vigilantly they would have found	183.4247550234307
They have not found but they are on the track	63.50913010344026
Yes that the usual phrase I am quite familiar with it	49.76443991020179
When the police is at fault it declares that it is on the track and the government patiently awaits the day when it comes to say with a sneaking air that the track is lost	198.5097201099864
Yes but they have found a corpse the general has been killed and in all countries they call that a murder	130.94701126349662
A murder do you call it why there is nothing to prove that the general was murdered	57.32390074714188
People are found every day in the Seine having thrown themselves in or having been drowned from not knowing how to swim	288.4621051371326
Father you know very well that the general was not a man to drown himself in despair and people do not bathe in the Seine in the month of January	76.67277419157054
No no do not be deceived this was murder in every sense of the word	126.4461134141313
The king I thought he was philosopher enough to allow that there was no murder in politics	142.55417765972868
In politics my dear fellow you know as well as I do there are no men but ideasno feelings but interests in politics we do not kill a man we only remove an obstacle that is all	155.22837944345272
Would you like to know how matters have progressed Well I will tell you	186.69900184721365
It was thought reliance might be placed in General Quesnel he was recommended to us from the Island of Elba one of us went to him and invited him to the Rue SaintJacques where he would find some friends	59.10122609019383
He came there and the plan was unfolded to him for leaving Elba the projected landing etc	645.3518449745935
When he had heard and comprehended all to the fullest extent he replied that he was a royalist	185.70893609840127
Then all looked at each otherhe was made to take an oath and did so but with such an ill grace that it was really tempting Providence to swear thus and yet in spite of that the general was allowed to depart freeperfectly free	175.55188967022323
Yet he did not return home	45.85625873443797
What could that mean why my dear fellow that on leaving us he lost his way that s all	69.39511102571018
A murder really Villefort you surprise me	308.4863854749322
You a deputy procureur to found an accusation on such bad premises Did I ever say to you when you were fulfilling your character as a royalist and cut off the head of one of my party My son you have committed a murder No I said Very well sir you have gained the victory tomorrow perchance it will be our turn	152.90939807360326
But father take care when our turn comes our revenge will be sweeping	445.47676894339924
You rely on the usurpers return	850.1800176127787
You are mistaken he will not advance two leagues into the interior of France without being followed tracked and caught like a wild beast	203.38383263219947
My dear fellow the emperor is at this moment on the way to Grenoble on the 10th or 12th he will be at Lyons and on the 20th or 25th at Paris	176.16759156307293
Yes to go and meet him	6.506447930213449
He has but a handful of men with him and armies will be despatched against him	106.72796218018372
Yes to escort him into the capital	59.22830543533086
Really my dear Grard you are but a child you think yourself well informed because the telegraph has told you three days after the landing The usurper has landed at Cannes with several men	165.299889067485
But where is he what is he doing You do not know at all and in this way they will chase him to Paris without drawing a trigger	101.22007956182632
Grenoble and Lyons are faithful cities and will oppose to him an impassable barrier	419.01552480494837
Grenoble will open her gates to him with enthusiasmall Lyons will hasten to welcome him	448.8521240335847
Believe me we are as well informed as you and our police are as good as your own	63.222509969862074
Would you like a proof of it well you wished to conceal your journey from me and yet I knew of your arrival half an hour after you had passed the barrier	48.823747238427444
You gave your direction to no one but your postilion yet I have your address and in proof I am here the very instant you are going to sit at table	115.19943092318424
Ring then if you please for a second knife fork and plate and we will dine together	177.7641234719615
Indeed replied Villefort looking at his father with astonishment you really do seem very well informed	177.90188532797444
Eh the thing is simple enough	23.75245718535968
You who are in power have only the means that money produceswe who are in expectation have those which devotion prompts	609.612656706037
Devotion said Villefort with a sneer	4849.932591349144
Yes devotion for that is I believe the phrase for hopeful ambition	1266.2642565589256
And Villeforts father extended his hand to the bellrope to summon the servant whom his son had not called	63.863294677922426
Wait my dear father said the young man one word more	28.6981098728799
However stupid the royalist police may be they do know one terrible thing	234.4842941290339
The description of the man who on the morning of the day when General Quesnel disappeared presented himself at his house	61.45793637497242
Oh the admirable police have found that out have they And what may be that description	422.739128170571
Dark complexion hair eyebrows and whiskers black blue frockcoat buttoned up to the chin rosette of an officer of the Legion of Honor in his buttonhole a hat with wide brim and a cane	92.77804010558395
Ah ha that s it is it said Noirtier and why then have they not laid hands on him	103.96629228625594
Because yesterday or the day before they lost sight of him at the corner of the Rue CoqHron	22.84416582138491
Did nt I say that your police were good for nothing	187.6570324780304
Yes but they may catch him yet	44.14995616587671
True said Noirtier looking carelessly around him true if this person were not on his guard as he is and he added with a smile He will consequently make a few changes in his personal appearance	131.48838198530976
At these words he rose and put off his frockcoat and cravat went towards a table on which lay his sons toilet articles lathered his face took a razor and with a firm hand cut off the compromising whiskers	217.97304468101007
Villefort watched him with alarm not devoid of admiration	550.6355323006059
His whiskers cut off Noirtier gave another turn to his hair took instead of his black cravat a colored neckerchief which lay at the top of an open portmanteau put on in lieu of his blue and highbuttoned frockcoat a coat of Villeforts of dark brown and cut away in front tried on before the glass a narrowbrimmed hat of his sons which appeared to fit him perfectly and leaving his cane in the corner where he had deposited it he took up a small bamboo switch cut the air with it once or twice and walked about with that easy swagger which was one of his principal characteristics	189.9834981158901
Well he said turning towards his wondering son when this disguise was completed well do you think your police will recognize me now	266.8446773098491
No father stammered Villefort at least I hope not	18.582773804695176
And now my dear boy continued Noirtier I rely on your prudence to remove all the things which I leave in your care	115.03936508559751
Oh rely on me said Villefort	29.666952680219378
Yes yes and now I believe you are right and that you have really saved my life be assured I will return the favor hereafter	72.9485972870323
I hope at least that you may be mistaken	33.50004528428548
Shall you see the king again	187.91255018400383
Would you pass in his eyes for a prophet	153.350493552801
Prophets of evil are not in favor at the court father	209.13775302240944
True but some day they do them justice and supposing a second restoration you would then pass for a great man	161.93763805844395
Well what should I say to the king	37.97674870608881
Say this to him Sire you are deceived as to the feeling in France as to the opinions of the towns and the prejudices of the army he whom in Paris you call the Corsican ogre who at Nevers is styled the usurper is already saluted as Bonaparte at Lyons and emperor at Grenoble	240.60200745806227
You think he is tracked pursued captured he is advancing as rapidly as his own eagles	425.90501980798547
The soldiers you believe to be dying with hunger worn out with fatigue ready to desert gather like atoms of snow about the rolling ball as it hastens onward	560.9969509453905
Sire go leave France to its real master to him who acquired it not by purchase but by right of conquest go sire not that you incur any risk for your adversary is powerful enough to show you mercy but because it would be humiliating for a grandson of Saint Louis to owe his life to the man of Arcola Marengo Austerlitz	291.9847671327014
Tell him this Grard or rather tell him nothing	69.1076998993405
Keep your journey a secret do not boast of what you have come to Paris to do or have done return with all speed enter Marseilles at night and your house by the backdoor and there remain quiet submissive secret and above all inoffensive for this time I swear to you we shall act like powerful men who know their enemies	187.17637046977922
Go my songo my dear Grard and by your obedience to my paternal orders or if you prefer it friendly counsels we will keep you in your place	192.8260280662058
This will be added Noirtier with a smile one means by which you may a second time save me if the political balance should some day take another turn and cast you aloft while hurling me down	289.64591963141805
Adieu my dear Grard and at your next journey alight at my door	207.94957483514108
Noirtier left the room when he had finished with the same calmness that had characterized him during the whole of this remarkable and trying conversation	89.66688014962489
Villefort pale and agitated ran to the window put aside the curtain and saw him pass cool and collected by two or three illlooking men at the corner of the street who were there perhaps to arrest a man with black whiskers and a blue frockcoat and hat with broad brim	90.99129626853762
Villefort stood watching breathless until his father had disappeared at the Rue Bussy	99.64468095896775
Then he turned to the various articles he had left behind him put the black cravat and blue frockcoat at the bottom of the portmanteau threw the hat into a dark closet broke the cane into small bits and flung it in the fire put on his travellingcap and calling his valet checked with a look the thousand questions he was ready to ask paid his bill sprang into his carriage which was ready learned at Lyons that Bonaparte had entered Grenoble and in the midst of the tumult which prevailed along the road at length reached Marseilles a prey to all the hopes and fears which enter into the heart of man with ambition and its first successes	161.55534590898586
Noirtier was a true prophet and things progressed rapidly as he had predicted	495.61881083108045
Everyone knows the history of the famous return from Elba a return which was unprecedented in the past and will probably remain without a counterpart in the future	225.27915104988602
made but a faint attempt to parry this unexpected blow the monarchy he had scarcely reconstructed tottered on its precarious foundation and at a sign from the emperor the incongruous structure of ancient prejudices and new ideas fell to the ground	345.1536214284174
Villefort therefore gained nothing save the kings gratitude which was rather likely to injure him at the present time and the cross of the Legion of Honor which he had the prudence not to wear although M	98.13225645833816
de Blacas had duly forwarded the brevet	1336.4708995118408
Napoleon would doubtless have deprived Villefort of his office had it not been for Noirtier who was all powerful at court and thus the Girondin of 93 and the Senator of 1806 protected him who so lately had been his protector	176.54605663724493
All Villeforts influence barely enabled him to stifle the secret Dants had so nearly divulged	211.6955811740059
The kings procureur alone was deprived of his office being suspected of royalism	438.98313853873674
However scarcely was the imperial power establishedthat is scarcely had the emperor reentered the Tuileries and begun to issue orders from the closet into which we have introduced our readershe found on the table there Louis XVIII	300.60082781296256
s halffilled snuffboxscarcely had this occurred when Marseilles began in spite of the authorities to rekindle the flames of civil war always smouldering in the south and it required but little to excite the populace to acts of far greater violence than the shouts and insults with which they assailed the royalists whenever they ventured abroad	447.48387456516315
Owing to this change the worthy shipowner became at that momentwe will not say all powerful because Morrel was a prudent and rather a timid man so much so that many of the most zealous partisans of Bonaparte accused him of moderationbut sufficiently influential to make a demand in favor of Dants	361.67714721346914
Villefort retained his place but his marriage was put off until a more favorable opportunity	247.88490228834786
If the emperor remained on the throne Grard required a different alliance to aid his career if Louis XVIII	418.75721545188605
de SaintMran like his own could be vastly increased and the marriage be still more suitable	503.84525554280924
The deputy procureur was therefore the first magistrate of Marseilles when one morning his door opened and M	108.92216449766883
Anyone else would have hastened to receive him but Villefort was a man of ability and he knew this would be a sign of weakness	74.26808803105185
He made Morrel wait in the antechamber although he had no one with him for the simple reason that the kings procureur always makes everyone wait and after passing a quarter of an hour in reading the papers he ordered M	89.45904186925173
Morrel expected Villefort would be dejected he found him as he had found him six weeks before calm firm and full of that glacial politeness that most insurmountable barrier which separates the wellbred from the vulgar man	366.76282415223625
He had entered Villeforts office expecting that the magistrate would tremble at the sight of him on the contrary he felt a cold shudder all over him when he saw Villefort sitting there with his elbow on his desk and his head leaning on his hand	52.254164791403596
He stopped at the door Villefort gazed at him as if he had some difficulty in recognizing him then after a brief interval during which the honest shipowner turned his hat in his hands	94.85148256084256
Come nearer said the magistrate with a patronizing wave of the hand and tell me to what circumstance I owe the honor of this visit	43.22700548821017
Do you not guess monsieur asked Morrel	4.547168767143168
Not in the least but if I can serve you in any way I shall be delighted	31.061686812465243
Monsieur said Morrel recovering his assurance as he proceeded do you recollect that a few days before the landing of his majesty the emperor I came to intercede for a young man the mate of my ship who was accused of being concerned in correspondence with the Island of Elba What was the other day a crime is today a title to favor	110.04238747441063
and you did not show any favorit was your duty today you serve Napoleon and you ought to protect himit is equally your duty I come therefore to ask what has become of him	255.44656215068477
Villefort by a strong effort sought to control himself	323.9950686451371
What is his name said he	23.180037910389398
Villefort would probably have rather stood opposite the muzzle of a pistol at fiveandtwenty paces than have heard this name spoken but he did not blanch	262.3343334104556
Villefort opened a large register then went to a table from the table turned to his registers and then turning to Morrel	55.230726758304726
Are you quite sure you are not mistaken monsieur said he in the most natural tone in the world	26.404950821434582
Had Morrel been a more quicksighted man or better versed in these matters he would have been surprised at the kings procureur answering him on such a subject instead of referring him to the governors of the prison or the prefect of the department	141.55777125044332
But Morrel disappointed in his expectations of exciting fear was conscious only of the others condescension	957.6206437652352
No said Morrel I am not mistaken	25.31350440151569
I have known him for ten years the last four of which he was in my service	31.432276422649352
Do not you recollect I came about six weeks ago to plead for clemency as I come today to plead for justice	194.41624571315802
Oh the royalists were very severe with the Bonapartists in those days	266.7792963396947
Monsieur returned Villefort I was then a royalist because I believed the Bourbons not only the heirs to the throne but the chosen of the nation	247.66236215634595
The miraculous return of Napoleon has conquered me the legitimate monarch is he who is loved by his people	247.28565858440575
I like to hear you speak thus and I augur well for Edmond from it	548.01437713679
Wait a moment said Villefort turning over the leaves of a register I have ita sailor who was about to marry a young Catalan girl	110.05128189423677
I recollect now it was a very serious charge	141.34679358654031
You know that when he left here he was taken to the Palais de Justice	72.16447485757243
I made my report to the authorities at Paris and a week after he was carried off	77.55709583927633
What can they have done with him	24.50392007832082
Oh he has been taken to Fenestrelles to Pignerol or to the SainteMargurite islands	841.8272288203289
Some fine morning he will return to take command of your vessel	160.2824748701824
Come when he will it shall be kept for him	40.24580402708573
But how is it he is not already returned It seems to me the first care of government should be to set at liberty those who have suffered for their adherence to it	117.74874879703367
Do not be too hasty M	358.5710431417684
The order of imprisonment came from high authority and the order for his liberation must proceed from the same source and as Napoleon has scarcely been reinstated a fortnight the letters have not yet been forwarded	303.75116644694947
But said Morrel is there no way of expediting all these formalitiesof releasing him from arrest	812.730363888117
It is sometimes essential to government to cause a mans disappearance without leaving any traces so that no written forms or documents may defeat their wishes	450.5147314247271
It might be so under the Bourbons but at present	232.0287233909578
It has always been so my dear Morrel since the reign of Louis XIV	107.21965118598196
The emperor is more strict in prison discipline than even Louis himself and the number of prisoners whose names are not on the register is incalculable	267.2465417820573
Had Morrel even any suspicions so much kindness would have dispelled them	139.6904816706052
de Villefort how would you advise me to act asked he	81.1975776574834
Oh I know what that is the minister receives two hundred petitions every day and does not read three	310.30305467096673
That is true but he will read a petition countersigned and presented by me	360.8822060561429
And will you undertake to deliver it	247.3892980945179
Dants was then guilty and now he is innocent and it is as much my duty to free him as it was to condemn him	73.30020234935279
Villefort thus forestalled any danger of an inquiry which however improbable it might be if it did take place would leave him defenceless	205.91936306911558
But how shall I address the minister	108.09449624361403
Sit down there said Villefort giving up his place to Morrel and write what I dictate	103.82518174020996
But lose no time we have lost too much already	103.46333813383787
Only think what the poor fellow may even now be suffering	240.04281852814123
Villefort shuddered at the suggestion but he had gone too far to draw back	68.91715444217215
Dants must be crushed to gratify Villeforts ambition	4990.559435897881
Villefort dictated a petition in which from an excellent intention no doubt Dants patriotic services were exaggerated and he was made out one of the most active agents of Napoleons return	301.5732578501869
It was evident that at the sight of this document the minister would instantly release him	153.1535208514825
The petition finished Villefort read it aloud	471.64131326344153
That will do said he leave the rest to me	63.73690164768984
The best thing I can do will be to certify the truth of the contents of your petition	115.50799362309132
And sitting down Villefort wrote the certificate at the bottom	110.228513754036
What more is to be done	27.32445079147897
I will do whatever is necessary	715.3957758732872
This assurance delighted Morrel who took leave of Villefort and hastened to announce to old Dants that he would soon see his son	72.38272575274823
As for Villefort instead of sending to Paris he carefully preserved the petition that so fearfully compromised Dants in the hopes of an event that seemed not unlikelythat is a second restoration	447.5344280379204
Dants remained a prisoner and heard not the noise of the fall of Louis XVIII	65.38782324276796
s throne or the still more tragic destruction of the empire	380.44962541742774
Twice during the Hundred Days had Morrel renewed his demand and twice had Villefort soothed him with promises	474.74429493635006
At last there was Waterloo and Morrel came no more he had done all that was in his power and any fresh attempt would only compromise himself uselessly	207.2876002218972
remounted the throne Villefort to whom Marseilles had become filled with remorseful memories sought and obtained the situation of kings procureur at Toulouse and a fortnight afterwards he married Mademoiselle de SaintMran whose father now stood higher at court than ever	404.03371133595465
And so Dants after the Hundred Days and after Waterloo remained in his dungeon forgotten of earth and heaven	555.6105749682671
Danglars comprehended the full extent of the wretched fate that overwhelmed Dants and when Napoleon returned to France he after the manner of mediocre minds termed the coincidence a decree of Providence	329.41788255679853
But when Napoleon returned to Paris Danglars heart failed him and he lived in constant fear of Dants return on a mission of vengeance	180.36670486906453
Morrel of his wish to quit the sea and obtained a recommendation from him to a Spanish merchant into whose service he entered at the end of March that is ten or twelve days after Napoleons return	151.90091132704805
He then left for Madrid and was no more heard of	48.5866201190722
Fernand understood nothing except that Dants was absent	621.6368744693683
What had become of him he cared not to inquire	122.3088736875267
Only during the respite the absence of his rival afforded him he reflected partly on the means of deceiving Mercds as to the cause of his absence partly on plans of emigration and abduction as from time to time he sat sad and motionless on the summit of Cape Pharo at the spot from whence Marseilles and the Catalans are visible watching for the apparition of a young and handsome man who was for him also the messenger of vengeance	149.4339794763574
Fernands mind was made up he would shoot Dants and then kill himself	322.7893330593115
But Fernand was mistaken a man of his disposition never kills himself for he constantly hopes	473.25851666739993
During this time the empire made its last conscription and every man in France capable of bearing arms rushed to obey the summons of the emperor	206.229084710976
Fernand departed with the rest bearing with him the terrible thought that while he was away his rival would perhaps return and marry Mercds	225.92571955686495
Had Fernand really meant to kill himself he would have done so when he parted from Mercds	105.25433506397802
His devotion and the compassion he showed for her misfortunes produced the effect they always produce on noble mindsMercds had always had a sincere regard for Fernand and this was now strengthened by gratitude	376.3587899851984
My brother said she as she placed his knapsack on his shoulders be careful of yourself for if you are killed I shall be alone in the world	67.12957242533761
These words carried a ray of hope into Fernands heart	115.0696377955806
Should Dants not return Mercds might one day be his	288.89821216215864
Mercds was left alone face to face with the vast plain that had never seemed so barren and the sea that had never seemed so vast	167.2400768515147
Bathed in tears she wandered about the Catalan village	712.2013217403477
Sometimes she stood mute and motionless as a statue looking towards Marseilles at other times gazing on the sea and debating as to whether it were not better to cast herself into the abyss of the ocean and thus end her woes	133.38615452899515
It was not want of courage that prevented her putting this resolution into execution but her religious feelings came to her aid and saved her	248.96667976180723
Caderousse was like Fernand enrolled in the army but being married and eight years older he was merely sent to the frontier	100.94105303572312
Old Dants who was only sustained by hope lost all hope at Napoleons downfall	1727.2598255090147
Five months after he had been separated from his son and almost at the hour of his arrest he breathed his last in Mercds arms	99.25289299579109
Morrel paid the expenses of his funeral and a few small debts the poor old man had contracted	117.97147436918048
There was more than benevolence in this action there was courage the south was aflame and to assist even on his deathbed the father of so dangerous a Bonapartist as Dants was stigmatized as a crime	246.2295855022903
s restoration a visit was made by the inspectorgeneral of prisons	119.38411468706677
Dants in his cell heard the noise of preparationsounds that at the depth where he lay would have been inaudible to any but the ear of a prisoner who could hear the splash of the drop of water that every hour fell from the roof of his dungeon	110.90314427988744
He guessed something uncommon was passing among the living but he had so long ceased to have any intercourse with the world that he looked upon himself as dead	82.5965085880168
The inspector visited one after another the cells and dungeons of several of the prisoners whose good behavior or stupidity recommended them to the clemency of the government	426.25884425269925
He inquired how they were fed and if they had any request to make	90.0006370673215
The universal response was that the fare was detestable and that they wanted to be set free	125.29677941396373
The inspector asked if they had anything else to ask for	39.155102082341884
What could they desire beyond their liberty The inspector turned smilingly to the governor	452.54313224200763
I do not know what reason government can assign for these useless visits when you see one prisoner you see allalways the same thingill fed and innocent	1293.8699010472988
Yes the dangerous and mad prisoners are in the dungeons	312.58415792768886
Let us visit them said the inspector with an air of fatigue	31.784142794095107
We must play the farce to the end	33.29341434204844
Let us first send for two soldiers said the governor	113.74345714967666
The prisoners sometimes through mere uneasiness of life and in order to be sentenced to death commit acts of useless violence and you might fall a victim	209.66018707746176
Take all needful precautions replied the inspector	93.65159104716147
Two soldiers were accordingly sent for and the inspector descended a stairway so foul so humid so dark as to be loathsome to sight smell and respiration	651.0011010092426
Oh cried the inspector who can live here	73.99254733547112
A most dangerous conspirator a man we are ordered to keep the most strict watch over as he is daring and resolute	129.9110551990335
How long has he been there	447.1899617653217
Was he placed here when he first arrived	239.2705148064839
No not until he attempted to kill the turnkey who took his food to him	134.97115353283735
Yes the very one who is lighting us	661.3144174915369
Is it not true Antoine asked the governor	21.942923807982194
True enough he wanted to kill me returned the turnkey	148.3525331489337
He must be mad said the inspector	96.57078476936145
He is worse than thathe is a devil returned the turnkey	257.1128588859512
Shall I complain of him demanded the inspector	679.2998344792777
Besides he is almost mad now and in another year he will be quite so	129.20281493137549
So much the better for himhe will suffer less said the inspector	725.0324399757932
He was as this remark shows a man full of philanthropy and in every way fit for his office	251.54634762787944
You are right sir replied the governor and this remark proves that you have deeply considered the subject	137.59070551752836
Now we have in a dungeon about twenty feet distant and to which you descend by another stair an old abb formerly leader of a party in Italy who has been here since 1811 and in 1813 he went mad and the change is astonishing	227.4811426217576
He used to weep he now laughs he grew thin he now grows fat	2923.1456977499397
You had better see him for his madness is amusing	238.10360373157087
I will see them both returned the inspector I must conscientiously perform my duty	680.8799381575324
This was the inspectors first visit he wished to display his authority	107.17210483811499
Let us visit this one first added he	275.43378295178434
By all means replied the governor and he signed to the turnkey to open the door	66.2843770633938
At the sound of the key turning in the lock and the creaking of the hinges Dants who was crouched in a corner of the dungeon whence he could see the ray of light that came through a narrow iron grating above raised his head	69.21096062517294
Seeing a stranger escorted by two turnkeys holding torches and accompanied by two soldiers and to whom the governor spoke bareheaded Dants who guessed the truth and that the moment to address himself to the superior authorities was come sprang forward with clasped hands	265.4063742614762
The soldiers interposed their bayonets for they thought that he was about to attack the inspector and the latter recoiled two or three steps	67.74835242631741
Dants saw that he was looked upon as dangerous	859.9966070152719
Then infusing all the humility he possessed into his eyes and voice he addressed the inspector and sought to inspire him with pity	127.1270931660624
The inspector listened attentively then turning to the governor observed He will become religioushe is already more gentle he is afraid and retreated before the bayonetsmadmen are not afraid of anything I made some curious observations on this at Charenton	409.3135806884456
Then turning to the prisoner What is it you want said he	50.318148596281176
I want to know what crime I have committedto be tried and if I am guilty to be shot if innocent to be set at liberty	183.5249997118225
Are you well fed said the inspector	70.34294568567405
I believe so I do nt know its of no consequence	212.74660700174564
What matters really not only to me but to officers of justice and the king is that an innocent man should languish in prison the victim of an infamous denunciation to die here cursing his executioners	244.44672234639847
You are very humble today remarked the governor you are not so always the other day for instance when you tried to kill the turnkey	95.63614028415297
It is true sir and I beg his pardon for he has always been very good to me but I was mad	42.487090377452624
And you are not so any longer	219.71109534692383
No captivity has subdued meI have been here so long	19.518137026063307
So longwhen were you arrested then asked the inspector	112.2662515682567
The 28th of February 1815 at halfpast two in the afternoon	39.64442199668605
Today is the 30th of July 1816why it is but seventeen months	929.9149436949616
Oh you do not know what is seventeen months in prisonseventeen ages rather especially to a man who like me had arrived at the summit of his ambitionto a man who like me was on the point of marrying a woman he adored who saw an honorable career opened before him and who loses all in an instantwho sees his prospects destroyed and is ignorant of the fate of his affianced wife and whether his aged father be still living Seventeen months captivity to a sailor accustomed to the boundless ocean is a worse punishment than human crime ever merited	244.39656838539565
Have pity on me then and ask for me not intelligence but a trial not pardon but a verdicta trial sir I ask only for a trial that surely can not be denied to one who is accused	231.0265945858402
We shall see said the inspector then turning to the governor On my word the poor devil touches me	185.836225384441
You must show me the proofs against him	398.5098642941713
Certainly but you will find terrible charges	34329.07690728
Monsieur continued Dants I know it is not in your power to release me but you can plead for meyou can have me triedand that is all I ask	96.57246363692362
Let me know my crime and the reason why I was condemned	61.12008277722328
Go on with the lights said the inspector	81.0880263869138
Monsieur cried Dants I can tell by your voice you are touched with pity tell me at least to hope	86.83831113924502
I can not tell you that replied the inspector I can only promise to examine into your case	127.81320506026039
Oh I am freethen I am saved	97.81366759172703
See him and hear what he says	22.13171451521735
Villefort is no longer at Marseilles he is now at Toulouse	274.33496015198943
I am no longer surprised at my detention murmured Dants since my only protector is removed	418.8867529232469
de Villefort any cause of personal dislike to you	152.89712018099442
None on the contrary he was very kind to me	27.631928118460277
I can then rely on the notes he has left concerning you	181.4997264315693
That is well wait patiently then	50.57217855549947
Dants fell on his knees and prayed earnestly	529.9927190722269
The door closed but this time a fresh inmate was left with DantsHope	564.3737248637725
Will you see the register at once asked the governor or proceed to the other cell	147.2194098958325
Let us visit them all said the inspector	70.34393099265284
If I once went up those stairs	1509.8650898689443
I should never have the courage to come down again	56.8256564448378
Ah this one is not like the other and his madness is less affecting than this ones display of reason	226.1457798718147
He fancies he possesses an immense treasure	875.5343576834231
The first year he offered government a million of francs for his release the second two the third three and so on progressively	390.6727974669973
He is now in his fifth year of captivity he will ask to speak to you in private and offer you five millions	112.85064084988944
It is here unlock the door Antoine	17580.002223968288
The turnkey obeyed and the inspector gazed curiously into the chamber of the mad abb as the prisoner was usually called	406.4121231542335
In the centre of the cell in a circle traced with a fragment of plaster detached from the wall sat a man whose tattered garments scarcely covered him	409.30144153208136
He was drawing in this circle geometrical lines and seemed as much absorbed in his problem as Archimedes was when the soldier of Marcellus slew him	848.2860961702451
He did not move at the sound of the door and continued his calculations until the flash of the torches lighted up with an unwonted glare the sombre walls of his cell then raising his head he perceived with astonishment the number of persons present	117.29227465994667
He hastily seized the coverlet of his bed and wrapped it round him	56.20646318280515
What is it you want said the inspector	83.74675941887583
I monsieur replied the abb with an air of surpriseI want nothing	71.4347547675981
You do not understand continued the inspector I am sent here by government to visit the prison and hear the requests of the prisoners	153.15775446585377
Oh that is different cried the abb and we shall understand each other I hope	40.40535303976862
There now whispered the governor it is just as I told you	25.69751825726189
Monsieur continued the prisoner I am the Abb Faria born at Rome	279.4375068818094
I was for twenty years Cardinal Spadas secretary I was arrested why I know not toward the beginning of the year 1811 since then I have demanded my liberty from the Italian and French government	263.2434632627266
Because I was arrested at Piombino and I presume that like Milan and Florence Piombino has become the capital of some French department	468.5551521999278
Ah said the inspector you have not the latest news from Italy	139.87330661441175
My information dates from the day on which I was arrested returned the Abb Faria and as the emperor had created the kingdom of Rome for his infant son I presume that he has realized the dream of Machiavelli and Csar Borgia which was to make Italy a united kingdom	156.16095098974967
Monsieur returned the inspector Providence has changed this gigantic plan you advocate so warmly	737.6464976640463
It is the only means of rendering Italy strong happy and independent	1227.0568729118656
Very possibly only I am not come to discuss politics but to inquire if you have anything to ask or to complain of	123.04380031194542
The food is the same as in other prisonsthat is very bad the lodging is very unhealthful but on the whole passable for a dungeon but it is not that which I wish to speak of but a secret I have to reveal of the greatest importance	195.42726865027063
We are coming to the point whispered the governor	699.4492481255508
It is for that reason I am delighted to see you continued the abb although you have disturbed me in a most important calculation which if it succeeded would possibly change Newtons system	156.50565164534115
Could you allow me a few words in private	139.07343299314203
What did I tell you said the governor	33.16443266880022
You knew him returned the inspector with a smile	49.575801997064836
What you ask is impossible monsieur continued he addressing Faria	1776.0267062178402
But said the abb I would speak to you of a large sum amounting to five millions	42.587315940160806
The very sum you named whispered the inspector in his turn	80.97471177913224
However continued Faria seeing that the inspector was about to depart it is not absolutely necessary for us to be alone the governor can be present	78.28163771678692
Unfortunately said the governor I know beforehand what you are about to say it concerns your treasures does it not Faria fixed his eyes on him with an expression that would have convinced anyone else of his sanity	92.5013896281066
Of course said he of what else should I speak	210.09482474791926
Inspector continued the governor I can tell you the story as well as he for it has been dinned in my ears for the last four or five years	37.01408336427085
That proves returned the abb that you are like those of Holy Writ who having eyes see not and having ears hear not	307.2776364415908
My dear sir the government is rich and does not want your treasures replied the inspector keep them until you are liberated	158.70580742561077
The abbs eyes glistened he seized the inspectors hand	289.1929497248201
But what if I am not liberated cried he and am detained here until my death this treasure will be lost	178.54233309612218
Had not government better profit by it I will offer six millions and I will content myself with the rest if they will only give me my liberty	54.43312211819124
On my word said the inspector in a low tone had I not been told beforehand that this man was mad I should believe what he says	60.832341288448625
I am not mad replied Faria with that acuteness of hearing peculiar to prisoners	528.0970022993935
The treasure I speak of really exists and I offer to sign an agreement with you in which I promise to lead you to the spot where you shall dig and if I deceive you bring me here againI ask no more	122.59120523832374
Is the spot far from here	29.06369812250393
It is not illplanned said the governor	149.429075785859
If all the prisoners took it into their heads to travel a hundred leagues and their guardians consented to accompany them they would have a capital chance of escaping	186.9193001779225
The scheme is well known said the inspector and the abbs plan has not even the merit of originality	174.3586474623113
Then turning to Faria I inquired if you are well fed said he	212.5718565345767
Swear to me replied Faria to free me if what I tell you prove true and I will stay here while you go to the spot	70.55127688082266
Are you well fed repeated the inspector	182.10985599138345
Monsieur you run no risk for as I told you I will stay here so there is no chance of my escaping	70.30423380204807
You do not reply to my question replied the inspector impatiently	319.22704795886375
Nor you to mine cried the abb	36.320114352287945
You will not accept my gold I will keep it for myself	49.5233998567716
You refuse me my liberty God will give it me	106.16621903254043
And the abb casting away his coverlet resumed his place and continued his calculations	188.29081652181728
What is he doing there said the inspector	42.35624379704245
Counting his treasures replied the governor	3472.0223854905116
Faria replied to this sarcasm with a glance of profound contempt	40.60872597979139
The turnkey closed the door behind them	31.590902288064946
He was wealthy once perhaps said the inspector	119.85269249219688
Or dreamed he was and awoke mad	7485.780986027282
After all said the inspector if he had been rich he would not have been here	34.98678566710498
So the matter ended for the Abb Faria	215.7884335393828
He remained in his cell and this visit only increased the belief in his insanity	395.31807531058763
Caligula or Nero those treasureseekers those desirers of the impossible would have accorded to the poor wretch in exchange for his wealth the liberty he so earnestly prayed for	141.3498265922327
But the kings of modern times restrained by the limits of mere probability have neither courage nor desire	280.34550630284997
They fear the ear that hears their orders and the eye that scrutinizes their actions	518.4009327291708
Formerly they believed themselves sprung from Jupiter and shielded by their birth but nowadays they are not inviolable	376.764755254482
It has always been against the policy of despotic governments to suffer the victims of their persecutions to reappear	553.1495522355169
As the Inquisition rarely allowed its victims to be seen with their limbs distorted and their flesh lacerated by torture so madness is always concealed in its cell from whence should it depart it is conveyed to some gloomy hospital where the doctor has no thought for man or mind in the mutilated being the jailer delivers to him	341.4303109797413
The very madness of the Abb Faria gone mad in prison condemned him to perpetual captivity	699.3374907131412
The inspector kept his word with Dants he examined the register and found the following note concerning him	152.37795880495855
Violent Bonapartist took an active part in the return from Elba	187.73246218784664
The greatest watchfulness and care to be exercised	114.3971399459372
This note was in a different hand from the rest which showed that it had been added since his confinement	115.26342930167448
The inspector could not contend against this accusation he simply wrote Nothing to be done	262.08334086001173
This visit had infused new vigor into Dants he had till then forgotten the date but now with a fragment of plaster he wrote the date 30th July 1816 and made a mark every day in order not to lose his reckoning again	291.70663458453276
Days and weeks passed away then monthsDants still waited he at first expected to be freed in a fortnight	196.76328558192856
This fortnight expired he decided that the inspector would do nothing until his return to Paris and that he would not reach there until his circuit was finished he therefore fixed three months three months passed away then six more	146.690924657577
Finally ten months and a half had gone by and no favorable change had taken place and Dants began to fancy the inspectors visit but a dream an illusion of the brain	233.89739614574862
At the expiration of a year the governor was transferred he had obtained charge of the fortress at Ham	547.677863761781
He took with him several of his subordinates and amongst them Dants jailer	1045.4059907536976
A new governor arrived it would have been too tedious to acquire the names of the prisoners he learned their numbers instead	105.617647525009
This horrible place contained fifty cells their inhabitants were designated by the numbers of their cell and the unhappy young man was no longer called Edmond Dantshe was now number 34	320.50015218567626
Dants passed through all the stages of torture natural to prisoners in suspense	2953.6490519727517
He was sustained at first by that pride of conscious innocence which is the sequence to hope then he began to doubt his own innocence which justified in some measure the governors belief in his mental alienation and then relaxing his sentiment of pride he addressed his supplications not to God but to man	322.237369464746
God is always the last resource	1381.3108669924065
Unfortunates who ought to begin with God do not have any hope in him till they have exhausted all other means of deliverance	119.50566539200254
Dants asked to be removed from his present dungeon into another even if it were darker and deeper for a change however disadvantageous was still a change and would afford him some amusement	380.7534906479869
He entreated to be allowed to walk about to have fresh air books and writing materials	554.7015179843278
His requests were not granted but he went on asking all the same	69.05591906428036
He accustomed himself to speaking to the new jailer although the latter was if possible more taciturn than the old one but still to speak to a man even though mute was something	176.5887008408585
Dants spoke for the sake of hearing his own voice he had tried to speak when alone but the sound of his voice terrified him	78.33860648495134
Often before his captivity Dants mind had revolted at the idea of assemblages of prisoners made up of thieves vagabonds and murderers	481.7314020393286
He now wished to be amongst them in order to see some other face besides that of his jailer he sighed for the galleys with the infamous costume the chain and the brand on the shoulder	189.05649088705755
The galleyslaves breathed the fresh air of heaven and saw each other	33.87476166540807
He besought the jailer one day to let him have a companion were it even the mad abb	156.03245522022286
The jailer though rough and hardened by the constant sight of so much suffering was yet a man	102.22572480711341
At the bottom of his heart he had often had a feeling of pity for this unhappy young man who suffered so and he laid the request of number 34 before the governor but the latter sapiently imagined that Dants wished to conspire or attempt an escape and refused his request	202.02782634201532
Dants had exhausted all human resources and he then turned to God	232.66323050342362
All the pious ideas that had been so long forgotten returned he recollected the prayers his mother had taught him and discovered a new meaning in every word for in prosperity prayers seem but a mere medley of words until misfortune comes and the unhappy sufferer first understands the meaning of the sublime language in which he invokes the pity of heaven He prayed and prayed aloud no longer terrified at the sound of his own voice for he fell into a sort of ecstasy	216.64325063767888
He laid every action of his life before the Almighty proposed tasks to accomplish and at the end of every prayer introduced the entreaty oftener addressed to man than to God Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against us	537.4525246326054
Yet in spite of his earnest prayers Dants remained a prisoner	1137.130278972724
Then gloom settled heavily upon him	32.160818709355446
Dants was a man of great simplicity of thought and without education he could not therefore in the solitude of his dungeon traverse in mental vision the history of the ages bring to life the nations that had perished and rebuild the ancient cities so vast and stupendous in the light of the imagination and that pass before the eye glowing with celestial colors in Martins Babylonian pictures	312.766795491218
He could not do this he whose past life was so short whose present so melancholy and his future so doubtful	302.8608564911216
Nineteen years of light to reflect upon in eternal darkness No distraction could come to his aid his energetic spirit that would have exalted in thus revisiting the past was imprisoned like an eagle in a cage	484.54791319667277
He clung to one ideathat of his happiness destroyed without apparent cause by an unheardof fatality he considered and reconsidered this idea devoured it so to speak as the implacable Ugolino devours the skull of Archbishop Roger in the Inferno of Dante	726.7523827970056
Dants uttered blasphemies that made his jailer recoil with horror dashed himself furiously against the walls of his prison wreaked his anger upon everything and chiefly upon himself so that the least thinga grain of sand a straw or a breath of air that annoyed him led to paroxysms of fury	321.7070799171168
Then the letter that Villefort had showed to him recurred to his mind and every line gleamed forth in fiery letters on the wall like the mene mene tekel upharsin of Belshazzar	322.8239201326528
He told himself that it was the enmity of man and not the vengeance of Heaven that had thus plunged him into the deepest misery	120.48059589485858
He consigned his unknown persecutors to the most horrible tortures he could imagine and found them all insufficient because after torture came death and after death if not repose at least the boon of unconsciousness	345.21338835291834
By dint of constantly dwelling on the idea that tranquillity was death and if punishment were the end in view other tortures than death must be invented he began to reflect on suicide	289.2536718250091
Unhappy he who on the brink of misfortune broods over ideas like these	922.5019664803532
Before him is a dead sea that stretches in azure calm before the eye but he who unwarily ventures within its embrace finds himself struggling with a monster that would drag him down to perdition	685.210046457089
Once thus ensnared unless the protecting hand of God snatch him thence all is over and his struggles but tend to hasten his destruction	1064.8490192610764
This state of mental anguish is however less terrible than the sufferings that precede or the punishment that possibly will follow	332.5846574226827
There is a sort of consolation at the contemplation of the yawning abyss at the bottom of which lie darkness and obscurity	236.33137142392994
Edmond found some solace in these ideas	86.14509203951495
All his sorrows all his sufferings with their train of gloomy spectres fled from his cell when the angel of death seemed about to enter	170.3206449792679
Dants reviewed his past life with composure and looking forward with terror to his future existence chose that middle line that seemed to afford him a refuge	259.3441862507622
Sometimes said he in my voyages when I was a man and commanded other men I have seen the heavens overcast the sea rage and foam the storm arise and like a monstrous bird beating the two horizons with its wings	299.3219324370179
Then I felt that my vessel was a vain refuge that trembled and shook before the tempest	463.35466361520577
Soon the fury of the waves and the sight of the sharp rocks announced the approach of death and death then terrified me and I used all my skill and intelligence as a man and a sailor to struggle against the wrath of God	102.36444076158529
But I did so because I was happy because I had not courted death because to be cast upon a bed of rocks and seaweed seemed terrible because I was unwilling that I a creature made for the service of God should serve for food to the gulls and ravens	196.3901347475192
But now it is different I have lost all that bound me to life death smiles and invites me to repose I die after my own manner I die exhausted and brokenspirited as I fall asleep when I have paced three thousand times round my cellthat is thirty thousand steps or about ten leagues	178.99252366907828
No sooner had this idea taken possession of him than he became more composed arranged his couch to the best of his power ate little and slept less and found existence almost supportable because he felt that he could throw it off at pleasure like a wornout garment	309.2690876586562
Two methods of selfdestruction were at his disposal	64.00406987120354
He could hang himself with his handkerchief to the window bars or refuse food and die of starvation	201.44723116063741
But the first was repugnant to him	11.67366803986632
Dants had always entertained the greatest horror of pirates who are hung up to the yardarm he would not die by what seemed an infamous death	182.35696342115295
He resolved to adopt the second and began that day to carry out his resolve	345.372647224349
Nearly four years had passed away at the end of the second he had ceased to mark the lapse of time	36.59212513779007
Dants said I wish to die and had chosen the manner of his death and fearful of changing his mind he had taken an oath to die	70.34771130714759
When my morning and evening meals are brought thought he I will cast them out of the window and they will think that I have eaten them	151.26476617181692
He kept his word twice a day he cast out through the barred aperture the provisions his jailer brought himat first gayly then with deliberation and at last with regret	626.5640027912558
Nothing but the recollection of his oath gave him strength to proceed	182.10523199335324
Hunger made viands once repugnant now acceptable he held the plate in his hand for an hour at a time and gazed thoughtfully at the morsel of bad meat of tainted fish of black and mouldy bread	228.89443684247948
It was the last yearning for life contending with the resolution of despair then his dungeon seemed less sombre his prospects less desperate	510.10862885590524
He was still younghe was only four or fiveandtwentyhe had nearly fifty years to live	201.82234712201313
What unforseen events might not open his prison door and restore him to liberty Then he raised to his lips the repast that like a voluntary Tantalus he refused himself but he thought of his oath and he would not break it	183.13691268732407
He persisted until at last he had not sufficient strength to rise and cast his supper out of the loophole	154.66828722154168
The next morning he could not see or hear the jailer feared he was dangerously ill	299.4901401759887
Edmond felt a sort of stupor creeping over him which brought with it a feeling almost of content the gnawing pain at his stomach had ceased his thirst had abated when he closed his eyes he saw myriads of lights dancing before them like the willothewisps that play about the marshes	425.04199865399863
It was the twilight of that mysterious country called Death	1459.420663777383
Suddenly about nine oclock in the evening Edmond heard a hollow sound in the wall against which he was lying	63.67973603494686
So many loathsome animals inhabited the prison that their noise did not in general awake him but whether abstinence had quickened his faculties or whether the noise was really louder than usual Edmond raised his head and listened	247.81718099871367
It was a continual scratching as if made by a huge claw a powerful tooth or some iron instrument attacking the stones	605.1959410136901
Although weakened the young mans brain instantly responded to the idea that haunts all prisonersliberty It seemed to him that heaven had at length taken pity on him and had sent this noise to warn him on the very brink of the abyss	188.9862348594589
Perhaps one of those beloved ones he had so often thought of was thinking of him and striving to diminish the distance that separated them	147.70586260983262
No no doubtless he was deceived and it was but one of those dreams that forerun death	170.22346876202886
It lasted nearly three hours he then heard a noise of something falling and all was silent	117.7375212316577
Some hours afterwards it began again nearer and more distinct	235.1659832170603
For a week since he had resolved to die and during the four days that he had been carrying out his purpose Edmond had not spoken to the attendant had not answered him when he inquired what was the matter with him and turned his face to the wall when he looked too curiously at him but now the jailer might hear the noise and put an end to it and so destroy a ray of something like hope that soothed his last moments	96.10847022184154
The jailer brought him his breakfast	699.0849478786058
Dants raised himself up and began to talk about everything about the bad quality of the food about the coldness of his dungeon grumbling and complaining in order to have an excuse for speaking louder and wearying the patience of his jailer who out of kindness of heart had brought broth and white bread for his prisoner	238.24905082122243
Fortunately he fancied that Dants was delirious and placing the food on the rickety table he withdrew	185.03966484086124
Edmond listened and the sound became more and more distinct	73.9222541102336
There can be no doubt about it thought he it is some prisoner who is striving to obtain his freedom	168.19079762022267
Oh if I were only there to help him	157.26567131040645
Suddenly another idea took possession of his mind so used to misfortune that it was scarcely capable of hopethe idea that the noise was made by workmen the governor had ordered to repair the neighboring dungeon	154.95971382033628
It was easy to ascertain this but how could he risk the question It was easy to call his jailers attention to the noise and watch his countenance as he listened but might he not by this means destroy hopes far more important than the shortlived satisfaction of his own curiosity Unfortunately Edmonds brain was still so feeble that he could not bend his thoughts to anything in particular	193.47498070924368
He saw but one means of restoring lucidity and clearness to his judgment	828.2030864637803
He turned his eyes towards the soup which the jailer had brought rose staggered towards it raised the vessel to his lips and drank off the contents with a feeling of indescribable pleasure	122.04770702200786
He had the resolution to stop with this	121.10054654092144
He had often heard that shipwrecked persons had died through having eagerly devoured too much food	1037.1509332403605
Edmond replaced on the table the bread he was about to devour and returned to his couchhe did not wish to die	110.65225889295988
He soon felt that his ideas became again collectedhe could think and strengthen his thoughts by reasoning	960.1559209970658
I must put this to the test but without compromising anybody	633.4702655054708
If it is a workman I need but knock against the wall and he will cease to work in order to find out who is knocking and why he does so but as his occupation is sanctioned by the governor he will soon resume it	142.64129627019412
If on the contrary it is a prisoner the noise I make will alarm him he will cease and not begin again until he thinks everyone is asleep	170.54049216771082
Edmond rose again but this time his legs did not tremble and his sight was clear he went to a corner of his dungeon detached a stone and with it knocked against the wall where the sound came	99.84625882969873
At the first blow the sound ceased as if by magic	159.47781128527907
Edmond listened intently an hour passed two hours passed and no sound was heard from the wallall was silent there	117.42401691793198
Full of hope Edmond swallowed a few mouthfuls of bread and water and thanks to the vigor of his constitution found himself wellnigh recovered	220.94905395714903
The day passed away in utter silencenight came without recurrence of the noise	856.7323532814753
It is a prisoner said Edmond joyfully	2101.632161405711
His brain was on fire and life and energy returned	291.15501683599257
The night passed in perfect silence	15.944660863101342
Edmond did not close his eyes	6.297025633255827
In the morning the jailer brought him fresh provisionshe had already devoured those of the previous day he ate these listening anxiously for the sound walking round and round his cell shaking the iron bars of the loophole restoring vigor and agility to his limbs by exercise and so preparing himself for his future destiny	326.0703156291277
At intervals he listened to learn if the noise had not begun again and grew impatient at the prudence of the prisoner who did not guess he had been disturbed by a captive as anxious for liberty as himself	142.80324360337332
Three days passedseventytwo long tedious hours which he counted off by minutes	192.57647481894287
At length one evening as the jailer was visiting him for the last time that night Dants with his ear for the hundredth time at the wall fancied he heard an almost imperceptible movement among the stones	111.62039712705531
He moved away walked up and down his cell to collect his thoughts and then went back and listened	56.571863433834224
The matter was no longer doubtful	13204.937608137145
Something was at work on the other side of the wall the prisoner had discovered the danger and had substituted a lever for a chisel	104.88641204054022
Encouraged by this discovery Edmond determined to assist the indefatigable laborer	1367.1102359976019
He began by moving his bed and looked around for anything with which he could pierce the wall penetrate the moist cement and displace a stone	178.23384127780912
He saw nothing he had no knife or sharp instrument the window grating was of iron but he had too often assured himself of its solidity	276.7652368684538
All his furniture consisted of a bed a chair a table a pail and a jug	202.50413656396708
The bed had iron clamps but they were screwed to the wood and it would have required a screwdriver to take them off	122.41797267171803
The table and chair had nothing the pail had once possessed a handle but that had been removed	266.12922279870327
Dants had but one resource which was to break the jug and with one of the sharp fragments attack the wall	128.7035463510109
He let the jug fall on the floor and it broke in pieces	29.592443760797916
Dants concealed two or three of the sharpest fragments in his bed leaving the rest on the floor	82.66502891799256
The breaking of his jug was too natural an accident to excite suspicion	316.16912090652437
Edmond had all the night to work in but in the darkness he could not do much and he soon felt that he was working against something very hard he pushed back his bed and waited for day	151.33570986634817
All night he heard the subterranean workman who continued to mine his way	423.5698824037328
Dants told him that the jug had fallen from his hands while he was drinking and the jailer went grumblingly to fetch another without giving himself the trouble to remove the fragments of the broken one	142.38292261838873
He returned speedily advised the prisoner to be more careful and departed	435.0599924335864
Dants heard joyfully the key grate in the lock he listened until the sound of steps died away and then hastily displacing his bed saw by the faint light that penetrated into his cell that he had labored uselessly the previous evening in attacking the stone instead of removing the plaster that surrounded it	226.58267905956467
The damp had rendered it friable and Dants was able to break it offin small morsels it is true but at the end of half an hour he had scraped off a handful a mathematician might have calculated that in two years supposing that the rock was not encountered a passage twenty feet long and two feet broad might be formed	265.0162596230263
The prisoner reproached himself with not having thus employed the hours he had passed in vain hopes prayer and despondency	324.85437715275333
During the six years that he had been imprisoned what might he not have accomplished	78.38252685948768
This idea imparted new energy and in three days he had succeeded with the utmost precaution in removing the cement and exposing the stonework	152.8329085718456
The wall was built of rough stones among which to give strength to the structure blocks of hewn stone were at intervals imbedded	952.5171167258254
It was one of these he had uncovered and which he must remove from its socket	352.322305230703
Dants strove to do this with his nails but they were too weak	150.84543099486015
The fragments of the jug broke and after an hour of useless toil Dants paused with anguish on his brow	151.61850313574558
Was he to be thus stopped at the beginning and was he to wait inactive until his fellow workman had completed his task Suddenly an idea occurred to himhe smiled and the perspiration dried on his forehead	412.22731518363906
The jailer always brought Dants soup in an iron saucepan this saucepan contained soup for both prisoners for Dants had noticed that it was either quite full or half empty according as the turnkey gave it to him or to his companion first	315.3091011819937
The handle of this saucepan was of iron Dants would have given ten years of his life in exchange for it	80.27127622003279
The jailer was accustomed to pour the contents of the saucepan into Dants plate and Dants after eating his soup with a wooden spoon washed the plate which thus served for every day	313.58286299934
Now when evening came Dants put his plate on the ground near the door the jailer as he entered stepped on it and broke it	62.618813135761116
This time he could not blame Dants	11637.290832126964
He was wrong to leave it there but the jailer was wrong not to have looked before him	93.16093648228505
Then he looked about for something to pour the soup into Dants entire dinner service consisted of one platethere was no alternative	1349.8868628560526
Leave the saucepan said Dants you can take it away when you bring me my breakfast	54.8931775317502
This advice was to the jailers taste as it spared him the necessity of making another trip	684.9709457269333
Dants was beside himself with joy	139.72194636095918
He rapidly devoured his food and after waiting an hour lest the jailer should change his mind and return he removed his bed took the handle of the saucepan inserted the point between the hewn stone and rough stones of the wall and employed it as a lever	183.62345678774162
A slight oscillation showed Dants that all went well	654.6819696704458
At the end of an hour the stone was extricated from the wall leaving a cavity a foot and a half in diameter	158.01531168307818
Dants carefully collected the plaster carried it into the corner of his cell and covered it with earth	63.03878835589677
Then wishing to make the best use of his time while he had the means of labor he continued to work without ceasing	157.8643191824076
At the dawn of day he replaced the stone pushed his bed against the wall and lay down	61.76275743876024
The breakfast consisted of a piece of bread the jailer entered and placed the bread on the table	66.48797375264725
Well do nt you intend to bring me another plate said Dants	108.15285367903402
No replied the turnkey you destroy everything	2148.46252982906
First you break your jug then you make me break your plate if all the prisoners followed your example the government would be ruined	164.64840752925392
I shall leave you the saucepan and pour your soup into that	619.6527028682767
So for the future I hope you will not be so destructive	45.46124473685337
Dants raised his eyes to heaven and clasped his hands beneath the coverlet	56.95962933771451
He felt more gratitude for the possession of this piece of iron than he had ever felt for anything	61.91589076864828
He had noticed however that the prisoner on the other side had ceased to labor no matter this was a greater reason for proceedingif his neighbor would not come to him he would go to his neighbor	117.65447160388995
All day he toiled on untiringly and by the evening he had succeeded in extracting ten handfuls of plaster and fragments of stone	347.5596989971705
When the hour for his jailers visit arrived Dants straightened the handle of the saucepan as well as he could and placed it in its accustomed place	171.0111518116698
The turnkey poured his ration of soup into it together with the fishfor thrice a week the prisoners were deprived of meat	380.464889274905
This would have been a method of reckoning time had not Dants long ceased to do so	324.1932309445742
Having poured out the soup the turnkey retired	1225.9957958583755
Dants wished to ascertain whether his neighbor had really ceased to work	128.3956166442235
He listenedall was silent as it had been for the last three days	10.663804090038292
Dants sighed it was evident that his neighbor distrusted him	412.8849739290362
However he toiled on all the night without being discouraged but after two or three hours he encountered an obstacle	218.18259376308225
The iron made no impression but met with a smooth surface Dants touched it and found that it was a beam	185.2907733421025
This beam crossed or rather blocked up the hole Dants had made it was necessary therefore to dig above or under it	297.28695889787303
The unhappy young man had not thought of this	41.94242255632344
Oh my God my God murmured he I have so earnestly prayed to you that I hoped my prayers had been heard	72.55597908512831
After having deprived me of my liberty after having deprived me of death after having recalled me to existence my God have pity on me and do not let me die in despair	83.41896619268528
Who talks of God and despair at the same time said a voice that seemed to come from beneath the earth and deadened by the distance sounded hollow and sepulchral in the young mans ears	83.85282002536174
Edmonds hair stood on end and he rose to his knees	27.606753034830174
Ah said he I hear a human voice	120.31253148230279
Edmond had not heard anyone speak save his jailer for four or five years and a jailer is no man to a prisonerhe is a living door a barrier of flesh and blood adding strength to restraints of oak and iron	303.4238109946464
In the name of Heaven cried Dants speak again though the sound of your voice terrifies me	131.40612188954972
Who are you said the voice	183.63318647334845
An unhappy prisoner replied Dants who made no hesitation in answering	79.76096315970207
How long have you been here	24.99043082943616
Since the 28th of February 1815	695.6897192011274
But of what are you accused	21855.67976515184
Of having conspired to aid the emperors return	524.0695142174313
What For the emperors returnthe emperor is no longer on the throne then	57.81150966725479
He abdicated at Fontainebleau in 1814 and was sent to the Island of Elba	43.254132629249014
But how long have you been here that you are ignorant of all this	25.305734591071452
Dants shuddered this man had been four years longer than himself in prison	82.86042827471309
Do not dig any more said the voice only tell me how high up is your excavation	373.4210910384536
On a level with the floor	388.478688235978
Has your bed been moved since you have been a prisoner	34.463114728169586
What does your chamber open on	173.1228115442235
Oh what is the matter cried Dants	54.745390658655964
I have made a mistake owing to an error in my plans	142.76900381227816
I took the wrong angle and have come out fifteen feet from where I intended	190.9907856935183
I took the wall you are mining for the outer wall of the fortress	200.4985362506845
But then you would be close to the sea	75.88147710733806
I should have thrown myself into the sea gained one of the islands near herethe Isle de Daume or the Isle de Tiboulenand then I should have been safe	212.53149922095295
Could you have swum so far	12.191492620911891
Heaven would have given me strength but now all is lost	275.2123720358521
Yes stop up your excavation carefully do not work any more and wait until you hear from me	150.0068066782361
Tell me at least who you are	37.36425228370239
You mistrust me then said Dants	1525.0856493653548
Edmond fancied he heard a bitter laugh resounding from the depths	283.3450165830485
Oh I am a Christian cried Dants guessing instinctively that this man meant to abandon him	320.1849130431819
I swear to you by him who died for us that naught shall induce me to breathe one syllable to my jailers but I conjure you do not abandon me	164.18589600267285
If you do I swear to you for I have got to the end of my strength that I will dash my brains out against the wall and you will have my death to reproach yourself with	55.180446066850756
How old are you Your voice is that of a young man	29.469427737703157
I do not know my age for I have not counted the years I have been here	61.07401351342478
All I do know is that I was just nineteen when I was arrested the 28th of February 1815	137.77139343964834
Not quite twentysix murmured the voice at that age he can not be a traitor	89.2032090714066
I swear to you again rather than betray you I would allow myself to be hacked in pieces	204.68954263928805
You have done well to speak to me and ask for my assistance for I was about to form another plan and leave you but your age reassures me	82.49212638243128
I must calculate our chances I will give you the signal	40.988073525442175
But you will not leave me you will come to me or you will let me come to you	16.94847559968805
We will escape and if we can not escape we will talk you of those whom you love and I of those whom I love	68.56665730454876
No I am alone in the world	4.982979872145491
If you are young I will be your comrade if you are old I will be your son	47.09428085752037
I have a father who is seventy if he yet lives I only love him and a young girl called Mercds	166.27983256837547
My father has not yet forgotten me I am sure but God alone knows if she loves me still I shall love you as I loved my father	46.2145751923725
It is well returned the voice tomorrow	1544.2207077956862
These few words were uttered with an accent that left no doubt of his sincerity Dants rose dispersed the fragments with the same precaution as before and pushed his bed back against the wall	135.45495079584504
He then gave himself up to his happiness	69.1284442546407
He would no longer be alone	75.2513737932523
He was perhaps about to regain his liberty at the worst he would have a companion and captivity that is shared is but half captivity	281.90658905259824
Plaints made in common are almost prayers and prayers where two or three are gathered together invoke the mercy of heaven	271.5596398683296
All day Dants walked up and down his cell	33.984676160270546
He sat down occasionally on his bed pressing his hand on his heart	14.21326066348506
At the slightest noise he bounded towards the door	40.167366392545595
Once or twice the thought crossed his mind that he might be separated from this unknown whom he loved already and then his mind was made upwhen the jailer moved his bed and stooped to examine the opening he would kill him with his water jug	143.23860225498464
He would be condemned to die but he was about to die of grief and despair when this miraculous noise recalled him to life	66.11466668058608
The jailer came in the evening	95.7924028966308
It seemed to him that thus he better guarded the unfinished opening	1774.161426812994
Doubtless there was a strange expression in his eyes for the jailer said Come are you going mad again	49.05230674767312
Dants did not answer he feared that the emotion of his voice would betray him	68.89101190556956
The jailer went away shaking his head	3.3181460444517175
Night came Dants hoped that his neighbor would profit by the silence to address him but he was mistaken	79.50694229936127
The next morning however just as he removed his bed from the wall he heard three knocks he threw himself on his knees	50.54905935732226
Is it you said he I am here	18.31541066290822
Yes said Dants he will not return until the evening so that we have twelve hours before us	73.46972680063078
I can work then said the voice	48.96931739332656
Oh yes yes this instant I entreat you	17.10729935602693
In a moment that part of the floor on which Dants was resting his two hands as he knelt with his head in the opening suddenly gave way he drew back smartly while a mass of stones and earth disappeared in a hole that opened beneath the aperture he himself had formed	107.39683487407812
Then from the bottom of this passage the depth of which it was impossible to measure he saw appear first the head then the shoulders and lastly the body of a man who sprang lightly into his cell	106.42887780363822
Seizing in his arms the friend so long and ardently desired Dants almost carried him towards the window in order to obtain a better view of his features by the aid of the imperfect light that struggled through the grating	139.65286158406687
He was a man of small stature with hair blanched rather by suffering and sorrow than by age	556.445321094688
He had a deepset penetrating eye almost buried beneath the thick gray eyebrow and a long and still black beard reaching down to his breast	173.28696226724253
His thin face deeply furrowed by care and the bold outline of his strongly marked features betokened a man more accustomed to exercise his mental faculties than his physical strength	441.63449767916734
Large drops of perspiration were now standing on his brow while the garments that hung about him were so ragged that one could only guess at the pattern upon which they had originally been fashioned	217.05812948205292
The stranger might have numbered sixty or sixtyfive years but a certain briskness and appearance of vigor in his movements made it probable that he was aged more from captivity than the course of time	386.2162777182521
He received the enthusiastic greeting of his young acquaintance with evident pleasure as though his chilled affections were rekindled and invigorated by his contact with one so warm and ardent	294.09714169308955
He thanked him with grateful cordiality for his kindly welcome although he must at that moment have been suffering bitterly to find another dungeon where he had fondly reckoned on discovering a means of regaining his liberty	356.8907523364739
Let us first see said he whether it is possible to remove the traces of my entrance hereour future tranquillity depends upon our jailers being entirely ignorant of it	248.92339575565484
Advancing to the opening he stooped and raised the stone easily in spite of its weight then fitting it into its place he said	123.24563360791883
You removed this stone very carelessly but I suppose you had no tools to aid you	89.16195066947166
Why exclaimed Dants with astonishment do you possess any	75.3000912846036
I made myself some and with the exception of a file I have all that are necessarya chisel pincers and lever	290.0856463861533
Oh how I should like to see these products of your industry and patience	432.4018232710934
Well in the first place here is my chisel	517.28568150338
So saying he displayed a sharp strong blade with a handle made of beechwood	645.3690694098854
And with what did you contrive to make that inquired Dants	294.92589059900115
With one of the clamps of my bedstead and this very tool has sufficed me to hollow out the road by which I came hither a distance of about fifty feet	183.51848262202193
Fifty feet responded Dants almost terrified	484.36276886193696
Do not speak so loud young mandont speak so loud	1287.9657822717445
It frequently occurs in a state prison like this that persons are stationed outside the doors of the cells purposely to overhear the conversation of the prisoners	238.14057723026983
But they believe I am shut up alone here	269.93620639078955
And you say that you dug your way a distance of fifty feet to get here	203.27314060250413
I do that is about the distance that separates your chamber from mine only unfortunately I did not curve aright for want of the necessary geometrical instruments to calculate my scale of proportion instead of taking an ellipsis of forty feet I made it fifty	637.8939855225832
I expected as I told you to reach the outer wall pierce through it and throw myself into the sea I have however kept along the corridor on which your chamber opens instead of going beneath it	138.94192730549688
My labor is all in vain for I find that the corridor looks into a courtyard filled with soldiers	133.8982596740605
That s true said Dants but the corridor you speak of only bounds one side of my cell there are three othersdo you know anything of their situation	196.1783026520822
This one is built against the solid rock and it would take ten experienced miners duly furnished with the requisite tools as many years to perforate it	489.9584873754045
This adjoins the lower part of the governors apartments and were we to work our way through we should only get into some lockup cellars where we must necessarily be recaptured	340.8695197331427
The fourth and last side of your cell faces onfaces onstop a minute now where does it face	1404.292745042823
The wall of which he spoke was the one in which was fixed the loophole by which light was admitted to the chamber	111.74205109431176
This loophole which gradually diminished in size as it approached the outside to an opening through which a child could not have passed was for better security furnished with three iron bars so as to quiet all apprehensions even in the mind of the most suspicious jailer as to the possibility of a prisoners escape	205.629195410125
As the stranger asked the question he dragged the table beneath the window	144.20190613390446
Climb up said he to Dants	9091.317456601686
The young man obeyed mounted on the table and divining the wishes of his companion placed his back securely against the wall and held out both hands	70.19620148840268
The stranger whom as yet Dants knew only by the number of his cell sprang up with an agility by no means to be expected in a person of his years and light and steady on his feet as a cat or a lizard climbed from the table to the outstretched hands of Dants and from them to his shoulders then bending double for the ceiling of the dungeon prevented him from holding himself erect he managed to slip his head between the upper bars of the window so as to be able to command a perfect view from top to bottom	131.98427387411638
An instant afterwards he hastily drew back his head saying I thought so and sliding from the shoulders of Dants as dextrously as he had ascended he nimbly leaped from the table to the ground	115.67769719764627
What was it that you thought asked the young man anxiously in his turn descending from the table	58.4157796531005
The elder prisoner pondered the matter	418.91747781191344
Yes said he at length it is so	21.088682718372645
This side of your chamber looks out upon a kind of open gallery where patrols are continually passing and sentries keep watch day and night	560.9901357601993
Are you quite sure of that	26.610047292366378
I saw the soldiers shape and the top of his musket that made me draw in my head so quickly for I was fearful he might also see me	79.6891899770924
You perceive then the utter impossibility of escaping through your dungeon	478.7052196007728
Then pursued the young man eagerly	1081.8169486399393
Then answered the elder prisoner the will of God be done And as the old man slowly pronounced those words an air of profound resignation spread itself over his careworn countenance	150.808388110233
Dants gazed on the man who could thus philosophically resign hopes so long and ardently nourished with an astonishment mingled with admiration	452.1528523114699
Tell me I entreat of you who and what you are said he at length	43.54191266531151
Never have I met with so remarkable a person as yourself	97.28523872297203
Willingly answered the stranger if indeed you feel any curiosity respecting one now alas powerless to aid you in any way	213.65872562959544
Say not so you can console and support me by the strength of your own powerful mind	92.84984474266554
Pray let me know who you really are	94.2601558888922
The stranger smiled a melancholy smile	22.964548654761963
I am the Abb Faria and have been imprisoned as you know in this Chteau dIf since the year 1811 previously to which I had been confined for three years in the fortress of Fenestrelle	80.31508246721626
In the year 1811 I was transferred to Piedmont in France	235.27217837223867
It was at this period I learned that the destiny which seemed subservient to every wish formed by Napoleon had bestowed on him a son named king of Rome even in his cradle	251.0975707322697
I was very far then from expecting the change you have just informed me of namely that four years afterwards this colossus of power would be overthrown	232.43295933657353
Then who reigns in France at this momentNapoleon II	2041.363601784016
How inscrutable are the ways of Providencefor what great and mysterious purpose has it pleased Heaven to abase the man once so elevated and raise up him who was so abased	541.7008495443321
Dants whole attention was riveted on a man who could thus forget his own misfortunes while occupying himself with the destinies of others	97.33222961989995
Yes yes continued he Twill be the same as it was in England	68.33416311551528
and then some soninlaw or relation some Prince of Orange a stadtholder who becomes a king	1113.6124786378257
Then new concessions to the people then a constitution then liberty	748.5676637019609
Ah my friend said the abb turning towards Dants and surveying him with the kindling gaze of a prophet you are young you will see all this come to pass	131.37902664148513
Probably if ever I get out of prison	15.157075823601202
True replied Faria we are prisoners but I forget this sometimes and there are even moments when my mental vision transports me beyond these walls and I fancy myself at liberty	417.5955276211522
Because in 1807 I dreamed of the very plan Napoleon tried to realize in 1811 because like Machiavelli I desired to alter the political face of Italy and instead of allowing it to be split up into a quantity of petty principalities each held by some weak or tyrannical ruler I sought to form one large compact and powerful empire and lastly because I fancied I had found my Csar Borgia in a crowned simpleton who feigned to enter into my views only to betray me	377.1724239021709
It was the plan of Alexander VI	27057.834394198417
but it will never succeed now for they attempted it fruitlessly and Napoleon was unable to complete his work	329.120303808401
And the old man bowed his head	4.5428218606452395
Dants could not understand a man risking his life for such matters	326.90427858176673
Napoleon certainly he knew something of inasmuch as he had seen and spoken with him but of Clement VII	216.89715177483467
Are you not he asked the priest who here in the Chteau dIf is generally thought to beill	113.09383136314344
Mad you mean do nt you	1.7718760294548803
I did not like to say so answered Dants smiling	140.29377982055036
Well then resumed Faria with a bitter smile let me answer your question in full by acknowledging that I am the poor mad prisoner of the Chteau dIf for many years permitted to amuse the different visitors with what is said to be my insanity and in all probability I should be promoted to the honor of making sport for the children if such innocent beings could be found in an abode devoted like this to suffering and despair	143.60230890970163
Dants remained for a short time mute and motionless at length he said	35.09336611284597
Then you abandon all hope of escape	33.620598311597234
I perceive its utter impossibility and I consider it impious to attempt that which the Almighty evidently does not approve	333.0321800944944
Would it not be expecting too much to hope to succeed at your first attempt Why not try to find an opening in another direction from that which has so unfortunately failed	167.93085807852236
Alas it shows how little notion you can have of all it has cost me to effect a purpose so unexpectedly frustrated that you talk of beginning over again	222.08810337330712
In the first place I was four years making the tools I possess and have been two years scraping and digging out earth hard as granite itself then what toil and fatigue has it not been to remove huge stones I should once have deemed impossible to loosen	455.1835931314457
Whole days have I passed in these Titanic efforts considering my labor well repaid if by nighttime I had contrived to carry away a square inch of this hardbound cement changed by ages into a substance unyielding as the stones themselves then to conceal the mass of earth and rubbish I dug up I was compelled to break through a staircase and throw the fruits of my labor into the hollow part of it but the well is now so completely choked up that I scarcely think it would be possible to add another handful of dust without leading to discovery	328.07309226995983
Consider also that I fully believed I had accomplished the end and aim of my undertaking for which I had so exactly husbanded my strength as to make it just hold out to the termination of my enterprise and now at the moment when I reckoned upon success my hopes are forever dashed from me	160.6037798919761
No I repeat again that nothing shall induce me to renew attempts evidently at variance with the Almightys pleasure	803.0234868730006
Dants held down his head that the other might not see how joy at the thought of having a companion outweighed the sympathy he felt for the failure of the abbs plans	144.06442284236132
The abb sank upon Edmonds bed while Edmond himself remained standing	166.7992593620626
Escape had never once occurred to him	19.478008972272068
There are indeed some things which appear so impossible that the mind does not dwell on them for an instant	67.06749746955354
To undermine the ground for fifty feetto devote three years to a labor which if successful would conduct you to a precipice overhanging the seato plunge into the waves from the height of fifty sixty perhaps a hundred feet at the risk of being dashed to pieces against the rocks should you have been fortunate enough to have escaped the fire of the sentinels and even supposing all these perils past then to have to swim for your life a distance of at least three miles ere you could reach the shorewere difficulties so startling and formidable that Dants had never even dreamed of such a scheme resigning himself rather to death	248.88310842944645
But the sight of an old man clinging to life with so desperate a courage gave a fresh turn to his ideas and inspired him with new courage	135.734399790537
Another older and less strong than he had attempted what he had not had sufficient resolution to undertake and had failed only because of an error in calculation	183.24050654373943
This same person with almost incredible patience and perseverance had contrived to provide himself with tools requisite for so unparalleled an attempt	708.9823969577785
Another had done all this why then was it impossible to Dants Faria had dug his way through fifty feet Dants would dig a hundred Faria at the age of fifty had devoted three years to the task he who was but half as old would sacrifice six Faria a priest and savant had not shrunk from the idea of risking his life by trying to swim a distance of three miles to one of the islandsDaume Rattonneau or Lemaire should a hardy sailor an experienced diver like himself shrink from a similar task should he who had so often for mere amusements sake plunged to the bottom of the sea to fetch up the bright coral branch hesitate to entertain the same project He could do it in an hour and how many times had he for pure pastime continued in the water for more than twice as long At once Dants resolved to follow the brave example of his energetic companion and to remember that what has once been done may be done again	265.2321059028191
After continuing some time in profound meditation the young man suddenly exclaimed I have found what you were in search of	82.0905690152759
Faria started Have you indeed cried he raising his head with quick anxiety pray let me know what it is you have discovered	45.46547477743517
The corridor through which you have bored your way from the cell you occupy here extends in the same direction as the outer gallery does it not	248.98979306097533
And is not above fifteen feet from it	74.1536159965962
Well then I will tell you what we must do	17.591532236405044
We must pierce through the corridor by forming a side opening about the middle as it were the top part of a cross	182.23504582912116
This time you will lay your plans more accurately we shall get out into the gallery you have described kill the sentinel who guards it and make our escape	204.93711535836763
All we require to insure success is courage and that you possess and strength which I am not deficient in as for patience you have abundantly proved yoursyou shall now see me prove mine	461.8905678406708
One instant my dear friend replied the abb it is clear you do not understand the nature of the courage with which I am endowed and what use I intend making of my strength	57.93589508896929
As for patience I consider that I have abundantly exercised that in beginning every morning the task of the night before and every night renewing the task of the day	135.83752663905955
But then young man and I pray of you to give me your full attention then I thought I could not be doing anything displeasing to the Almighty in trying to set an innocent being at libertyone who had committed no offence and merited not condemnation	187.93871409627363
And have your notions changed asked Dants with much surprise do you think yourself more guilty in making the attempt since you have encountered me	139.48902576934015
No neither do I wish to incur guilt	2275.549617851718
Hitherto I have fancied myself merely waging war against circumstances not men	1773.809289838851
I have thought it no sin to bore through a wall or destroy a staircase but I can not so easily persuade myself to pierce a heart or take away a life	234.09637065599708
A slight movement of surprise escaped Dants	1308.994220753166
Is it possible said he that where your liberty is at stake you can allow any such scruple to deter you from obtaining it	229.05368243768427
Tell me replied Faria what has hindered you from knocking down your jailer with a piece of wood torn from your bedstead dressing yourself in his clothes and endeavoring to escape	260.02948788104686
Simply the fact that the idea never occurred to me answered Dants	184.18051954200524
Because said the old man the natural repugnance to the commission of such a crime prevented you from thinking of it and so it ever is because in simple and allowable things our natural instincts keep us from deviating from the strict line of duty	314.11438537447356
The tiger whose nature teaches him to delight in shedding blood needs but the sense of smell to show him when his prey is within his reach and by following this instinct he is enabled to measure the leap necessary to permit him to spring on his victim but man on the contrary loathes the idea of bloodit is not alone that the laws of social life inspire him with a shrinking dread of taking life his natural construction and physiological formation	366.44567004900443
Dants was confused and silent at this explanation of the thoughts which had unconsciously been working in his mind or rather soul for there are two distinct sorts of ideas those that proceed from the head and those that emanate from the heart	153.3450664150632
Since my imprisonment said Faria I have thought over all the most celebrated cases of escape on record	139.11983089039097
Those that have been crowned with full success have been long meditated upon and carefully arranged such for instance as the escape of the Duc de Beaufort from the Chteau de Vincennes that of the Abb Dubuquoi from For lEvque of Latude from the Bastille	243.898078154958
Then there are those for which chance sometimes affords opportunity and those are the best of all	433.8378200054415
Let us therefore wait patiently for some favorable moment and when it presents itself profit by it	234.26984824121593
Ah said Dants you might well endure the tedious delay you were constantly employed in the task you set yourself and when weary with toil you had your hopes to refresh and encourage you	374.27050184342136
I assure you replied the old man I did not turn to that source for recreation or support	177.37474119199229
Were you then permitted the use of pens ink and paper	71.3521841854999
Oh no answered the abb I had none but what I made for myself	65.5443174188564
You made paper pens and ink	18.379024841740197
Dants gazed with admiration but he had some difficulty in believing	57.47584082805578
When you pay me a visit in my cell my young friend said he I will show you an entire work the fruits of the thoughts and reflections of my whole life many of them meditated over in the shades of the Colosseum at Rome at the foot of St	107.44944588968487
Marks column at Venice and on the borders of the Arno at Florence little imagining at the time that they would be arranged in order within the walls of the Chteau dIf	105.93395566399059
The work I speak of is called A Treatise on the Possibility of a General Monarchy in Italy and will make one large quarto volume	630.3600736309811
And on what have you written all this	163.7537665925578
I invented a preparation that makes linen as smooth and as easy to write on as parchment	580.7416034597808
Somewhat I know Lavoisier and was the intimate friend of Cabanis	531.2184162617529
But for such a work you must have needed bookshad you any	361.9666290114562
I had nearly five thousand volumes in my library at Rome but after reading them over many times I found out that with one hundred and fifty wellchosen books a man possesses if not a complete summary of all human knowledge at least all that a man need really know	280.62424012559416
I devoted three years of my life to reading and studying these one hundred and fifty volumes till I knew them nearly by heart so that since I have been in prison a very slight effort of memory has enabled me to recall their contents as readily as though the pages were open before me	177.78820126906382
I could recite you the whole of Thucydides Xenophon Plutarch Titus Livius Tacitus Strada Jornandes Dante Montaigne Shakespeare Spinoza Machiavelli and Bossuet	13141.097715042662
I name only the most important	141.25062209524236
You are doubtless acquainted with a variety of languages so as to have been able to read all these	71.2915738247231
Yes I speak five of the modern tonguesthat is to say German French Italian English and Spanish by the aid of ancient Greek I learned modern GreekI do nt speak it so well as I could wish but I am still trying to improve myself	252.55295467268203
Improve yourself repeated Dants why how can you manage to do so	33.47395325566617
Why I made a vocabulary of the words I knew turned returned and arranged them so as to enable me to express my thoughts through their medium	142.28529664976475
I know nearly one thousand words which is all that is absolutely necessary although I believe there are nearly one hundred thousand in the dictionaries	114.40264655325763
I can not hope to be very fluent but I certainly should have no difficulty in explaining my wants and wishes and that would be quite as much as I should ever require	121.6889402887301
Stronger grew the wonder of Dants who almost fancied he had to do with one gifted with supernatural powers still hoping to find some imperfection which might bring him down to a level with human beings he added Then if you were not furnished with pens how did you manage to write the work you speak of	197.04927546422337
I made myself some excellent ones which would be universally preferred to all others if once known	237.5621176671397
You are aware what huge whitings are served to us on maigre days	1227.3440892369172
Well I selected the cartilages of the heads of these fishes and you can scarcely imagine the delight with which I welcomed the arrival of each Wednesday Friday and Saturday as affording me the means of increasing my stock of pens for I will freely confess that my historical labors have been my greatest solace and relief	322.58639538553524
While retracing the past I forget the present and traversing at will the path of history I cease to remember that I am myself a prisoner	210.4024396820736
But the ink said Dants of what did you make your ink	87.75493810688667
There was formerly a fireplace in my dungeon replied Faria but it was closed up long ere I became an occupant of this prison	124.35015932640115
Still it must have been many years in use for it was thickly covered with a coating of soot this soot I dissolved in a portion of the wine brought to me every Sunday and I assure you a better ink can not be desired	156.52893010899535
For very important notes for which closer attention is required I pricked one of my fingers and wrote with my own blood	265.106305838697
And when asked Dants may I see all this	23.351738200554426
Whenever you please replied the abb	61.02274025966135
Oh then let it be directly exclaimed the young man	36.73223408955719
Follow me then said the abb as he reentered the subterranean passage in which he soon disappeared followed by Dants	147.2710211335179
After having passed with tolerable ease through the subterranean passage which however did not admit of their holding themselves erect the two friends reached the further end of the corridor into which the abbs cell opened from that point the passage became much narrower and barely permitted one to creep through on hands and knees	251.97611892487845
The floor of the abbs cell was paved and it had been by raising one of the stones in the most obscure corner that Faria had been able to commence the laborious task of which Dants had witnessed the completion	158.53533696843556
As he entered the chamber of his friend Dants cast around one eager and searching glance in quest of the expected marvels but nothing more than common met his view	278.91608511849375
It is well said the abb we have some hours before usit is now just a quarter past twelve oclock	164.53941088700225
Instinctively Dants turned round to observe by what watch or clock the abb had been able so accurately to specify the hour	294.9691862568229
Look at this ray of light which enters by my window said the abb and then observe the lines traced on the wall	107.78247302506972
Well by means of these lines which are in accordance with the double motion of the earth and the ellipse it describes round the sun I am enabled to ascertain the precise hour with more minuteness than if I possessed a watch for that might be broken or deranged in its movements while the sun and earth never vary in their appointed paths	218.145354272447
This last explanation was wholly lost upon Dants who had always imagined from seeing the sun rise from behind the mountains and set in the Mediterranean that it moved and not the earth	128.89151378044883
A double movement of the globe he inhabited and of which he could feel nothing appeared to him perfectly impossible	192.94860479700304
Each word that fell from his companions lips seemed fraught with the mysteries of science as worthy of digging out as the gold and diamonds in the mines of Guzerat and Golconda which he could just recollect having visited during a voyage made in his earliest youth	258.93011927548457
Come said he to the abb I am anxious to see your treasures	93.50952916826196
The abb smiled and proceeding to the disused fireplace raised by the help of his chisel a long stone which had doubtless been the hearth beneath which was a cavity of considerable depth serving as a safe depository of the articles mentioned to Dants	273.7250363142337
What do you wish to see first asked the abb	104.79212603264045
Oh your great work on the monarchy of Italy	113.42503154599224
Faria then drew forth from his hidingplace three or four rolls of linen laid one over the other like folds of papyrus	282.1853402151026
These rolls consisted of slips of cloth about four inches wide and eighteen long they were all carefully numbered and closely covered with writing so legible that Dants could easily read it as well as make out the senseit being in Italian a language he as a Provenal perfectly understood	277.3466647199625
There said he there is the work complete	741.9283029866276
I wrote the word finis at the end of the sixtyeighth strip about a week ago	124.74996247310698
I have torn up two of my shirts and as many handkerchiefs as I was master of to complete the precious pages	271.96850955979863
Should I ever get out of prison and find in all Italy a printer courageous enough to publish what I have composed my literary reputation is forever secured	473.7371304897784
Now let me behold the curious pens with which you have written your work	258.65391454880825
Look said Faria showing to the young man a slender stick about six inches long and much resembling the size of the handle of a fine paintingbrush to the end of which was tied by a piece of thread one of those cartilages of which the abb had before spoken to Dants it was pointed and divided at the nib like an ordinary pen	119.26016812917318
Dants examined it with intense admiration then looked around to see the instrument with which it had been shaped so correctly into form	178.8685757660987
Ah yes said Faria the penknife	68620.9073442458
I made it as well as this larger knife out of an old iron candlestick	213.8013803492178
The penknife was sharp and keen as a razor as for the other knife it would serve a double purpose and with it one could cut and thrust	234.52735831529114
Dants examined the various articles shown to him with the same attention that he had bestowed on the curiosities and strange tools exhibited in the shops at Marseilles as the works of the savages in the South Seas from whence they had been brought by the different trading vessels	208.4930153279346
As for the ink said Faria I told you how I managed to obtain thatand I only just make it from time to time as I require it	102.63781207728579
One thing still puzzles me observed Dants and that is how you managed to do all this by daylight	158.35110154427744
I worked at night also replied Faria	1967.756937931025
Nightwhy for Heavens sake are your eyes like cats that you can see to work in the dark	164.30359626116768
Indeed they are not but God has supplied man with the intelligence that enables him to overcome the limitations of natural conditions	294.02972905824146
I furnished myself with a light	664.1768854104885
You did Pray tell me how	72.90157062563732
I separated the fat from the meat served to me melted it and so made oilhere is my lamp	800.6721674505832
So saying the abb exhibited a sort of torch very similar to those used in public illuminations	338.8474644839749
But how do you procure a light	237.45467966408623
Oh here are two flints and a piece of burnt linen	92.5784998818702
I pretended that I had a disorder of the skin and asked for a little sulphur which was readily supplied	217.4801175274393
Dants laid the different things he had been looking at on the table and stood with his head drooping on his breast as though overwhelmed by the perseverance and strength of Farias mind	90.01002658975897
You have not seen all yet continued Faria for I did not think it wise to trust all my treasures in the same hidingplace	167.22624346095944
Let us shut this one up	443.5449022122076
They put the stone back in its place the abb sprinkled a little dust over it to conceal the traces of its having been removed rubbed his foot well on it to make it assume the same appearance as the other and then going towards his bed he removed it from the spot it stood in	120.50833816809156
Behind the head of the bed and concealed by a stone fitting in so closely as to defy all suspicion was a hollow space and in this space a ladder of cords between twentyfive and thirty feet in length	172.5080026473406
Dants closely and eagerly examined it he found it firm solid and compact enough to bear any weight	337.5826577684378
Who supplied you with the materials for making this wonderful work	622.056548553851
I tore up several of my shirts and ripped out the seams in the sheets of my bed during my three years imprisonment at Fenestrelle and when I was removed to the Chteau dIf I managed to bring the ravellings with me so that I have been able to finish my work here	117.0481465903558
And was it not discovered that your sheets were unhemmed	743.9153289674866
Oh no for when I had taken out the thread I required I hemmed the edges over again	476.02442675012156
With this needle said the abb as opening his ragged vestments he showed Dants a long sharp fishbone with a small perforated eye for the thread a small portion of which still remained in it	373.01468397329603
I once thought continued Faria of removing these iron bars and letting myself down from the window which as you see is somewhat wider than yours although I should have enlarged it still more preparatory to my flight however I discovered that I should merely have dropped into a sort of inner court and I therefore renounced the project altogether as too full of risk and danger	261.2562969687133
Nevertheless I carefully preserved my ladder against one of those unforeseen opportunities of which I spoke just now and which sudden chance frequently brings about	242.13633682402144
While affecting to be deeply engaged in examining the ladder the mind of Dants was in fact busily occupied by the idea that a person so intelligent ingenious and clearsighted as the abb might probably be able to solve the dark mystery of his own misfortunes where he himself could see nothing	178.30288119623864
What are you thinking of asked the abb smilingly imputing the deep abstraction in which his visitor was plunged to the excess of his awe and wonder	220.57530781155612
I was reflecting in the first place replied Dants upon the enormous degree of intelligence and ability you must have employed to reach the high perfection to which you have attained	160.11008151306203
What would you not have accomplished if you had been free	85.40918586106939
Possibly nothing at all the overflow of my brain would probably in a state of freedom have evaporated in a thousand follies misfortune is needed to bring to light the treasures of the human intellect	347.56106546160606
Compression is needed to explode gunpowder	238002.9295029003
Captivity has brought my mental faculties to a focus and you are well aware that from the collision of clouds electricity is producedfrom electricity lightning from lightning illumination	733.4820238565285
Some of your words are to me quite empty of meaning	400.81484876996507
You must be blessed indeed to possess the knowledge you have	57.12353950347496
Well said he but you had another subject for your thoughts did you not say so just now	103.86913198393167
You have told me as yet but one of themlet me hear the other	323.18899093368583
It was thisthat while you had related to me all the particulars of your past life you were perfectly unacquainted with mine	92.48792177089099
Your life my young friend has not been of sufficient length to admit of your having passed through any very important events	259.6146404734772
It has been long enough to inflict on me a great and undeserved misfortune	311.83784479249147
I would fain fix the source of it on man that I may no longer vent reproaches upon Heaven	280.17885939312094
Then you profess ignorance of the crime with which you are charged	49.076406206761895
I do indeed and this I swear by the two beings most dear to me upon earthmy father and Mercds	315.9513799272173
Come said the abb closing his hidingplace and pushing the bed back to its original situation let me hear your story	139.62975322741167
Dants obeyed and commenced what he called his history but which consisted only of the account of a voyage to India and two or three voyages to the Levant until he arrived at the recital of his last cruise with the death of Captain Leclere and the receipt of a packet to be delivered by himself to the grand marshal his interview with that personage and his receiving in place of the packet brought a letter addressed to a Monsieur Noirtierhis arrival at Marseilles and interview with his fatherhis affection for Mercds and their nuptual feasthis arrest and subsequent examination his temporary detention at the Palais de Justice and his final imprisonment in the Chteau dIf	213.22459231201455
From this point everything was a blank to Dantshe knew nothing more not even the length of time he had been imprisoned	197.57083557837515
His recital finished the abb reflected long and earnestly	856.0718112406752
There is said he at the end of his meditations a clever maxim which bears upon what I was saying to you some little while ago and that is that unless wicked ideas take root in a naturally depraved mind human nature in a right and wholesome state revolts at crime	405.2057842754965
Still from an artificial civilization have originated wants vices and false tastes which occasionally become so powerful as to stifle within us all good feelings and ultimately to lead us into guilt and wickedness	740.8511495678214
From this view of things then comes the axiom that if you visit to discover the author of any bad action seek first to discover the person to whom the perpetration of that bad action could be in any way advantageous	184.81205148183122
Now to apply it in your caseto whom could your disappearance have been serviceable	736.6650421163415
To no one by Heaven I was a very insignificant person	102.67648209908849
Do not speak thus for your reply evinces neither logic nor philosophy everything is relative my dear young friend from the king who stands in the way of his successor to the employee who keeps his rival out of a place	280.3402722629545
Now in the event of the kings death his successor inherits a crownwhen the employee dies the supernumerary steps into his shoes and receives his salary of twelve thousand livres	487.6041102356311
Well these twelve thousand livres are his civil list and are as essential to him as the twelve millions of a king	190.2249708601013
Everyone from the highest to the lowest degree has his place on the social ladder and is beset by stormy passions and conflicting interests as in Descartes theory of pressure and impulsion	778.4983036153964
But these forces increase as we go higher so that we have a spiral which in defiance of reason rests upon the apex and not on the base	284.53565864546533
Now let us return to your particular world	1046.2847795910363
You say you were on the point of being made captain of the Pharaon	41.61500648727614
And about to become the husband of a young and lovely girl	89.24778698036933
Now could anyone have had any interest in preventing the accomplishment of these two things But let us first settle the question as to its being the interest of anyone to hinder you from being captain of the Pharaon	185.8681905159275
I can not believe such was the case	105.49209420542631
I was generally liked on board and had the sailors possessed the right of selecting a captain themselves I feel convinced their choice would have fallen on me	211.63996826987355
There was only one person among the crew who had any feeling of illwill towards me	165.54363224917222
I had quarelled with him some time previously and had even challenged him to fight me but he refused	222.98642885577078
And what was this mans name	68.94195530448951
What rank did he hold on board	170.70683206561466
And had you been captain should you have retained him in his employment	235.6459134324995
Not if the choice had remained with me for I had frequently observed inaccuracies in his accounts	253.20153867670368
Good again Now then tell me was any person present during your last conversation with Captain Leclere	286.6780946057443
Could your conversation have been overheard by anyone	205.8585017631435
It might for the cabin door was openandstay now I recollectDanglars himself passed by just as Captain Leclere was giving me the packet for the grand marshal	621.3352902201093
That s better cried the abb now we are on the right scent	110.9434436745669
Did you take anybody with you when you put into the port of Elba	49.60984466766011
Somebody there received your packet and gave you a letter in place of it I think	64.46603368707213
And what did you do with that letter	79.05124287200559
You had your portfolio with you then Now how could a sailor find room in his pocket for a portfolio large enough to contain an official letter	390.3201821650035
You are right it was left on board	306.04249592136404
Then it was not till your return to the ship that you put the letter in the portfolio	73.06099423574454
And what did you do with this same letter while returning from PortoFerrajo to the vessel	136.89266221874004
I carried it in my hand	43.4486586817856
So that when you went on board the Pharaon everybody could see that you held a letter in your hand	73.63860036032074
Danglars as well as the rest	108.250734224735
Now listen to me and try to recall every circumstance attending your arrest	569.8584619324827
Do you recollect the words in which the information against you was formulated	394.29669171320046
Oh yes I read it over three times and the words sank deeply into my memory	188.2728004894376
Dants paused a moment then said This is it word for word The kings attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and religion that one Edmond Dants mate on board the Pharaon this day arrived from Smyrna after having touched at Naples and PortoFerrajo has been intrusted by Murat with a packet for the usurper again by the usurper with a letter for the Bonapartist Club in Paris	77.89184718410638
This proof of his guilt may be procured by his immediate arrest as the letter will be found either about his person at his fathers residence or in his cabin on board the Pharaon	128.504779123554
The thing is clear as day said he and you must have had a very confiding nature as well as a good heart not to have suspected the origin of the whole affair	87.48458443293883
Do you really think so Ah that would indeed be infamous	287.143578270075
And how was the anonymous letter written	1909.4129629774459
It was very boldly written if disguised	6424.908447318374
Stop a bit said the abb taking up what he called his pen and after dipping it into the ink he wrote on a piece of prepared linen with his left hand the first two or three words of the accusation	57.22479713631753
Dants drew back and gazed on the abb with a sensation almost amounting to terror	106.22197575306092
How very astonishing cried he at length	69.05629568420495
Why your writing exactly resembles that of the accusation	73.69617056595723
Simply because that accusation had been written with the left hand and I have noticed that	27.191335786795097
That while the writing of different persons done with the right hand varies that performed with the left hand is invariably uniform	587.448352215763
You have evidently seen and observed everything	990.7254970041143
Now as regards the second question	95.58835130464401
Was there any person whose interest it was to prevent your marriage with Mercds	89.99981571325048
Yes a young man who loved her	103.30955642217481
That is a Spanish name I think	31.893055081786255
You imagine him capable of writing the letter	192.5100052830914
Oh no he would more likely have got rid of me by sticking a knife into me	150.74770452837498
That is in strict accordance with the Spanish character an assassination they will unhesitatingly commit but an act of cowardice never	464.9555770364251
Besides said Dants the various circumstances mentioned in the letter were wholly unknown to him	124.58861004044687
You had never spoken of them yourself to anyone	414.38503012705377
No not even to my betrothed	162.42690427908815
I feel quite sure of it now	66.52221763708603
Pray was Danglars acquainted with Fernand	1602.7727474335056
To have seen them both sitting at table together under an arbor at Pre Pamphiles the evening before the day fixed for my wedding	290.78484157349664
Danglars was joking in a friendly way but Fernand looked pale and agitated	220.98453724073931
There was a third person with them whom I knew perfectly well and who had in all probability made their acquaintance he was a tailor named Caderousse but he was very drunk	103.62904214611828
StaystayHow strange that it should not have occurred to me before Now I remember quite well that on the table round which they were sitting were pens ink and paper	108.03935518913042
Oh the heartless treacherous scoundrels exclaimed Dants pressing his hand to his throbbing brows	100.38244798687363
Is there anything else I can assist you in discovering besides the villany of your friends inquired the abb with a laugh	76.62971407127722
Yes yes replied Dants eagerly I would beg of you who see so completely to the depths of things and to whom the greatest mystery seems but an easy riddle to explain to me how it was that I underwent no second examination was never brought to trial and above all was condemned without ever having had sentence passed on me	206.33783494718955
That is altogether a different and more serious matter responded the abb	322.804876397771
The ways of justice are frequently too dark and mysterious to be easily penetrated	210.6428940699037
All we have hitherto done in the matter has been childs play	223.1256407368952
If you wish me to enter upon the more difficult part of the business you must assist me by the most minute information on every point	117.51672300997272
Pray ask me whatever questions you please for in good truth you see more clearly into my life than I do myself	86.62708557486356
In the first place then who examined youthe kings attorney his deputy or a magistrate	516.8261542725803
About six or sevenandtwenty years of age I should say	15.197688818948974
Old enough to be ambitious but too young to be corrupt	343.7707460921728
And how did he treat you	6.003862323497762
With more of mildness than severity	21479.524746313535
Did you tell him your whole story	864.4585171369879
And did his conduct change at all in the course of your examination	83.62577746638638
He did appear much disturbed when he read the letter that had brought me into this scrape	103.89313266295046
He seemed quite overcome by my misfortune	432.706959061725
Then you feel quite sure that it was your misfortune he deplored	175.08213785874176
He gave me one great proof of his sympathy at any rate	67.54375811104838
He burnt the sole evidence that could at all have criminated me	446.31621054951916
This man might after all be a greater scoundrel than you have thought possible	269.9830665164749
Upon my word said Dants you make me shudder	34.87373460448623
Is the world filled with tigers and crocodiles	2738.617033578161
Yes and remember that twolegged tigers and crocodiles are more dangerous than the others	199.30078205654726
Never mind let us go on	28.252548401161658
With all my heart You tell me he burned the letter	76.7796229213906
He did saying at the same time You see I thus destroy the only proof existing against you	205.72800287975724
This action is somewhat too sublime to be natural	229.99718704065722
To whom was this letter addressed	130.53409843701886
Now can you conceive of any interest that your heroic deputy could possibly have had in the destruction of that letter	235.23671900351724
Why it is not altogether impossible he might have had for he made me promise several times never to speak of that letter to anyone assuring me he so advised me for my own interest and more than this he insisted on my taking a solemn oath never to utter the name mentioned in the address	169.8852590180541
Noirtier repeated the abb NoirtierI knew a person of that name at the court of the Queen of Etruriaa Noirtier who had been a Girondin during the Revolution What was your deputy called	129.0059587086508
De Villefort The abb burst into a fit of laughter while Dants gazed on him in utter astonishment	37.353235918206416
What ails you said he at length	58.30048479138129
Do you see that ray of sunlight	34.8298577879108
Well the whole thing is more clear to me than that sunbeam is to you	126.83916974910493
Poor fellow poor young man And you tell me this magistrate expressed great sympathy and commiseration for you	261.9831924380331
And the worthy man destroyed your compromising letter	2239.365336939734
And then made you swear never to utter the name of Noirtier	91.49035832440059
Why you poor shortsighted simpleton can you not guess who this Noirtier was whose very name he was so careful to keep concealed This Noirtier was his father	204.99711933655055
Had a thunderbolt fallen at the feet of Dants or hell opened its yawning gulf before him he could not have been more completely transfixed with horror than he was at the sound of these unexpected words	116.36980849341977
Starting up he clasped his hands around his head as though to prevent his very brain from bursting and exclaimed His father his father	97.2974201646619
Yes his father replied the abb his right name was Noirtier de Villefort	53.52052666814336
At this instant a bright light shot through the mind of Dants and cleared up all that had been dark and obscure before	142.74300723535842
The change that had come over Villefort during the examination the destruction of the letter the exacted promise the almost supplicating tones of the magistrate who seemed rather to implore mercy than to pronounce punishmentall returned with a stunning force to his memory	328.62467868667636
He cried out and staggered against the wall like a drunken man then he hurried to the opening that led from the abbs cell to his own and said I must be alone to think over all this	70.31503095995313
When he regained his dungeon he threw himself on his bed where the turnkey found him in the evening visit sitting with fixed gaze and contracted features dumb and motionless as a statue	136.61193970415653
During these hours of profound meditation which to him had seemed only minutes he had formed a fearful resolution and bound himself to its fulfilment by a solemn oath	229.4126661045375
Dants was at length roused from his reverie by the voice of Faria who having also been visited by his jailer had come to invite his fellowsufferer to share his supper	131.41764960163084
The reputation of being out of his mind though harmlessly and even amusingly so had procured for the abb unusual privileges	754.8983489939449
He was supplied with bread of a finer whiter quality than the usual prison fare and even regaled each Sunday with a small quantity of wine	352.9217134856739
Now this was a Sunday and the abb had come to ask his young companion to share the luxuries with him	71.4023250452711
Dants followed him his features were no longer contracted and now wore their usual expression but there was that in his whole appearance that bespoke one who had come to a fixed and desperate resolve	200.56053010552586
Faria bent on him his penetrating eye	332.60253382570346
I regret now said he having helped you in your late inquiries or having given you the information I did	231.9522911757206
Because it has instilled a new passion in your heartthat of vengeance	616.5500896879083
Let us talk of something else said he	27.85934519486352
Again the abb looked at him then mournfully shook his head but in accordance with Dants request he began to speak of other matters	173.8688143348184
The elder prisoner was one of those persons whose conversation like that of all who have experienced many trials contained many useful and important hints as well as sound information but it was never egotistical for the unfortunate man never alluded to his own sorrows	181.18766714140523
Dants listened with admiring attention to all he said some of his remarks corresponded with what he already knew or applied to the sort of knowledge his nautical life had enabled him to acquire	173.46968797264086
A part of the good abbs words however were wholly incomprehensible to him but like the aurora which guides the navigator in northern latitudes opened new vistas to the inquiring mind of the listener and gave fantastic glimpses of new horizons enabling him justly to estimate the delight an intellectual mind would have in following one so richly gifted as Faria along the heights of truth where he was so much at home	777.6807274862578
You must teach me a small part of what you know said Dants if only to prevent your growing weary of me	194.81033772567238
I can well believe that so learned a person as yourself would prefer absolute solitude to being tormented with the company of one as ignorant and uninformed as myself	381.77108173204226
If you will only agree to my request I promise you never to mention another word about escaping	153.4318035060856
Alas my boy said he human knowledge is confined within very narrow limits and when I have taught you mathematics physics history and the three or four modern languages with which I am acquainted you will know as much as I do myself	262.2323173824455
Now it will scarcely require two years for me to communicate to you the stock of learning I possess	142.80863957410872
Two years exclaimed Dants do you really believe I can acquire all these things in so short a time	63.319580034328126
Not their application certainly but their principles you may to learn is not to know there are the learners and the learned	204.76048236875076
Memory makes the one philosophy the other	21.73327610969915
But can not one learn philosophy	213632.7427280075
Philosophy can not be taught it is the application of the sciences to truth it is like the golden cloud in which the Messiah went up into heaven	194.1778453953015
Well then said Dants What shall you teach me first I am in a hurry to begin	56.38905857398506
And that very evening the prisoners sketched a plan of education to be entered upon the following day	278.9781759515529
Dants possessed a prodigious memory combined with an astonishing quickness and readiness of conception the mathematical turn of his mind rendered him apt at all kinds of calculation while his naturally poetical feelings threw a light and pleasing veil over the dry reality of arithmetical computation or the rigid severity of geometry	722.5174902613836
He already knew Italian and had also picked up a little of the Romaic dialect during voyages to the East and by the aid of these two languages he easily comprehended the construction of all the others so that at the end of six months he began to speak Spanish English and German	133.6505068692428
In strict accordance with the promise made to the abb Dants spoke no more of escape	142.8482918132404
Perhaps the delight his studies afforded him left no room for such thoughts perhaps the recollection that he had pledged his word on which his sense of honor was keen kept him from referring in any way to the possibilities of flight	186.06603711758567
Days even months passed by unheeded in one rapid and instructive course	1556.7120321486864
At the end of a year Dants was a new man	146.90028760934823
Dants observed however that Faria in spite of the relief his society afforded daily grew sadder one thought seemed incessantly to harass and distract his mind	983.5342244244066
Sometimes he would fall into long reveries sigh heavily and involuntarily then suddenly rise and with folded arms begin pacing the confined space of his dungeon	751.9951075613567
One day he stopped all at once and exclaimed	93.7310631834345
Ah if there were no sentinel	12913.298550271342
There shall not be one a minute longer than you please said Dants who had followed the working of his thoughts as accurately as though his brain were enclosed in crystal so clear as to display its minutest operations	213.2561099578846
I have already told you answered the abb that I loathe the idea of shedding blood	220.54969975202113
And yet the murder if you choose to call it so would be simply a measure of selfpreservation	95.64737380656713
No matter I could never agree to it	273.6801947115412
Still you have thought of it	15.498783213337301
And you have discovered a means of regaining our freedom have you not asked Dants eagerly	293.3207053469261
I have if it were only possible to place a deaf and blind sentinel in the gallery beyond us	425.6096611806117
He shall be both blind and deaf replied the young man with an air of determination that made his companion shudder	59.150318062977306
No no cried the abb impossible	2215.017989885606
Dants endeavored to renew the subject the abb shook his head in token of disapproval and refused to make any further response	107.79652480361996
Are you strong the abb asked one day of Dants	66.31320087773429
The young man in reply took up the chisel bent it into the form of a horseshoe and then as readily straightened it	171.0224270386097
And will you engage not to do any harm to the sentry except as a last resort	138.93132823091645
Then said the abb we may hope to put our design into execution	134.1247533695519
And how long shall we be in accomplishing the necessary work	619.5123319546158
And shall we begin at once	33.66139729149775
We have lost a year to no purpose cried Dants	279.45881756665784
Do you consider the last twelve months to have been wasted asked the abb	116.45109997934709
Forgive me cried Edmond blushing deeply	1231.0250721574898
Tut tut answered the abb man is but man after all and you are about the best specimen of the genus I have ever known	97.67851078395992
Come let me show you my plan	132.4004126251408
The abb then showed Dants the sketch he had made for their escape	113.21456492876258
It consisted of a plan of his own cell and that of Dants with the passage which united them	123.10571399339626
In this passage he proposed to drive a level as they do in mines this level would bring the two prisoners immediately beneath the gallery where the sentry kept watch once there a large excavation would be made and one of the flagstones with which the gallery was paved be so completely loosened that at the desired moment it would give way beneath the feet of the soldier who stunned by his fall would be immediately bound and gagged by Dants before he had power to offer any resistance	237.5611596486503
The prisoners were then to make their way through one of the gallery windows and to let themselves down from the outer walls by means of the abbs ladder of cords	115.61807541805699
Dants eyes sparkled with joy and he rubbed his hands with delight at the idea of a plan so simple yet apparently so certain to succeed	87.51188110127931
That very day the miners began their labors with a vigor and alacrity proportionate to their long rest from fatigue and their hopes of ultimate success	606.197043675457
Nothing interrupted the progress of the work except the necessity that each was under of returning to his cell in anticipation of the turnkeys visits	351.93821943676147
They had learned to distinguish the almost imperceptible sound of his footsteps as he descended towards their dungeons and happily never failed of being prepared for his coming	174.5312906616794
The fresh earth excavated during their present work and which would have entirely blocked up the old passage was thrown by degrees and with the utmost precaution out of the window in either Farias or Dants cell the rubbish being first pulverized so finely that the night wind carried it far away without permitting the smallest trace to remain	366.4089392354144
More than a year had been consumed in this undertaking the only tools for which had been a chisel a knife and a wooden lever Faria still continuing to instruct Dants by conversing with him sometimes in one language sometimes in another at others relating to him the history of nations and great men who from time to time have risen to fame and trodden the path of glory	271.50878475848674
The abb was a man of the world and had moreover mixed in the first society of the day he wore an air of melancholy dignity which Dants thanks to the imitative powers bestowed on him by nature easily acquired as well as that outward polish and politeness he had before been wanting in and which is seldom possessed except by those who have been placed in constant intercourse with persons of high birth and breeding	176.74726742472734
At the end of fifteen months the level was finished and the excavation completed beneath the gallery and the two workmen could distinctly hear the measured tread of the sentinel as he paced to and fro over their heads	250.2159262352856
Compelled as they were to await a night sufficiently dark to favor their flight they were obliged to defer their final attempt till that auspicious moment should arrive their greatest dread now was lest the stone through which the sentry was doomed to fall should give way before its right time and this they had in some measure provided against by propping it up with a small beam which they had discovered in the walls through which they had worked their way	273.3449239494423
Dants was occupied in arranging this piece of wood when he heard Faria who had remained in Edmonds cell for the purpose of cutting a peg to secure their ropeladder call to him in a tone indicative of great suffering	203.32517708513822
Dants hastened to his dungeon where he found him standing in the middle of the room pale as death his forehead streaming with perspiration and his hands clenched tightly together	83.08806896177636
Gracious heavens exclaimed Dants what is the matter what has happened	15.45240226600494
Quick quick returned the abb listen to what I have to say	42.103434884728905
Dants looked in fear and wonder at the livid countenance of Faria whose eyes already dull and sunken were surrounded by purple circles while his lips were white as those of a corpse and his very hair seemed to stand on end	150.04825552402232
Tell me I beseech you what ails you cried Dants letting his chisel fall to the floor	424.79263480896645
Alas faltered out the abb all is over with me	45.2154588048358
I am seized with a terrible perhaps mortal illness I can feel that the paroxysm is fast approaching	324.33302231017217
I had a similar attack the year previous to my imprisonment	427.407778610475
This malady admits but of one remedy I will tell you what that is	50.23576176148384
Go into my cell as quickly as you can draw out one of the feet that support the bed you will find it has been hollowed out for the purpose of containing a small phial you will see there halffilled with a redlooking fluid	110.99841118655701
Bring it to meor ratherno noI may be found here therefore help me back to my room while I have the strength to drag myself along	120.21184579583152
Who knows what may happen or how long the attack may last	497.70079562791113
In spite of the magnitude of the misfortune which thus suddenly frustrated his hopes Dants did not lose his presence of mind but descended into the passage dragging his unfortunate companion with him then halfcarrying halfsupporting him he managed to reach the abbs chamber when he immediately laid the sufferer on his bed	180.6734745101753
Thanks said the poor abb shivering as though his veins were filled with ice	96.55355775702796
I am about to be seized with a fit of catalepsy when it comes to its height I shall probably lie still and motionless as though dead uttering neither sigh nor groan	286.0017527026099
On the other hand the symptoms may be much more violent and cause me to fall into fearful convulsions foam at the mouth and cry out loudly	265.0899444967777
Take care my cries are not heard for if they are it is more than probable I should be removed to another part of the prison and we be separated forever	83.89743680125524
When I become quite motionless cold and rigid as a corpse then and not beforebe careful about thisforce open my teeth with the knife pour from eight to ten drops of the liquor contained in the phial down my throat and I may perhaps revive	259.13993696100084
Perhaps exclaimed Dants in griefstricken tones	4819.327117070147
Help help cried the abb IIdieI	674597.2906047706
So sudden and violent was the fit that the unfortunate prisoner was unable to complete the sentence a violent convulsion shook his whole frame his eyes started from their sockets his mouth was drawn on one side his cheeks became purple he struggled foamed dashed himself about and uttered the most dreadful cries which however Dants prevented from being heard by covering his head with the blanket	171.29834052859295
The fit lasted two hours then more helpless than an infant and colder and paler than marble more crushed and broken than a reed trampled under foot he fell back doubled up in one last convulsion and became as rigid as a corpse	326.0033271826816
Edmond waited till life seemed extinct in the body of his friend then taking up the knife he with difficulty forced open the closely fixed jaws carefully administered the appointed number of drops and anxiously awaited the result	227.9460881004346
An hour passed away and the old man gave no sign of returning animation	86.11790209661757
Dants began to fear he had delayed too long ere he administered the remedy and thrusting his hands into his hair continued gazing on the lifeless features of his friend	141.016574391587
At length a slight color tinged the livid cheeks consciousness returned to the dull open eyeballs a faint sigh issued from the lips and the sufferer made a feeble effort to move	190.36821669711475
He is saved he is saved cried Dants in a paroxysm of delight	70.0551658837673
The sick man was not yet able to speak but he pointed with evident anxiety towards the door	58.639536962553024
Dants listened and plainly distinguished the approaching steps of the jailer	154.72005597595285
It was therefore near seven oclock but Edmonds anxiety had put all thoughts of time out of his head	184.41131995655542
The young man sprang to the entrance darted through it carefully drawing the stone over the opening and hurried to his cell	121.57758523687622
He had scarcely done so before the door opened and the jailer saw the prisoner seated as usual on the side of his bed	41.92030190816506
Almost before the key had turned in the lock and before the departing steps of the jailer had died away in the long corridor he had to traverse Dants whose restless anxiety concerning his friend left him no desire to touch the food brought him hurried back to the abbs chamber and raising the stone by pressing his head against it was soon beside the sick mans couch	181.25581719213375
Faria had now fully regained his consciousness but he still lay helpless and exhausted on his miserable bed	208.023638611324
I did not expect to see you again said he feebly to Dants	106.71937568116776
And why not asked the young man	2.968613766989749
No I had no such idea but knowing that all was ready for flight I thought you might have made your escape	87.3821999926052
The deep glow of indignation suffused the cheeks of Dants	136.79568520055676
Without you Did you really think me capable of that	66.7553830711309
At least said the abb I now see how wrong such an opinion would have been	73.88221101918168
Alas alas I am fearfully exhausted and debilitated by this attack	384.2951547971849
Be of good cheer replied Dants your strength will return	154.31433981357054
And as he spoke he seated himself near the bed beside Faria and took his hands	68.87856810895667
The last attack I had said he lasted but half an hour and after it I was hungry and got up without help now I can move neither my right arm nor leg and my head seems uncomfortable which shows that there has been a suffusion of blood on the brain	186.27649951947035
The third attack will either carry me off or leave me paralyzed for life	178.93238732016505
No no cried Dants you are mistakenyou will not die And your third attack if indeed you should have another will find you at liberty	128.5738933591646
We shall save you another time as we have done this only with a better chance of success because we shall be able to command every requisite assistance	122.462228951778
My good Edmond answered the abb be not deceived	130.56078806948224
The attack which has just passed away condemns me forever to the walls of a prison	184.1202923132363
None can fly from a dungeon who can not walk	249.82790533246654
Well we will waita week a month two months if need beand meanwhile your strength will return	425.9947269314983
Everything is in readiness for our flight and we can select any time we choose	156.85433073541128
As soon as you feel able to swim we will go	160.36715605339708
I shall never swim again replied Faria	1233.7679388237746
This arm is paralyzed not for a time but forever	132.60973583794686
Lift it and judge if I am mistaken	24.612074994434312
The young man raised the arm which fell back by its own weight perfectly inanimate and helpless	206.78072854844646
You are convinced now Edmond are you not asked the abb	21.29240346713697
Depend upon it I know what I say	21.89151998369373
Since the first attack I experienced of this malady I have continually reflected on it	279.9046087466185
Indeed I expected it for it is a family inheritance both my father and grandfather died of it in a third attack	146.2030373376637
The physician who prepared for me the remedy I have twice successfully taken was no other than the celebrated Cabanis and he predicted a similar end for me	346.315510551337
The physician may be mistaken exclaimed Dants	1106.1882071712887
And as for your poor arm what difference will that make I can take you on my shoulders and swim for both of us	255.07913859906373
My son said the abb you who are a sailor and a swimmer must know as well as I do that a man so loaded would sink before he had done fifty strokes	148.09898181425615
Cease then to allow yourself to be duped by vain hopes that even your own excellent heart refuses to believe in	288.6029919697904
Here I shall remain till the hour of my deliverance arrives and that in all human probability will be the hour of my death	107.0434748321852
As for you who are young and active delay not on my account but flygoI give you back your promise	242.88382897010413
Then rising and extending his hand with an air of solemnity over the old mans head he slowly added By the blood of Christ I swear never to leave you while you live	80.11799534318499
Faria gazed fondly on his nobleminded singlehearted highprincipled young friend and read in his countenance ample confirmation of the sincerity of his devotion and the loyalty of his purpose	359.31293964195027
Thanks murmured the invalid extending one hand	97.39664237871023
You may one of these days reap the reward of your disinterested devotion	451.9379524986509
But as I can not and you will not quit this place it becomes necessary to fill up the excavation beneath the soldiers gallery he might by chance hear the hollow sound of his footsteps and call the attention of his officer to the circumstance	149.24734436375965
That would bring about a discovery which would inevitably lead to our being separated	404.46887561054785
Go then and set about this work in which unhappily I can offer you no assistance keep at it all night if necessary and do not return here tomorrow till after the jailer has visited me	144.01093457856916
I shall have something of the greatest importance to communicate to you	44.33708738638956
Dants took the hand of the abb in his and affectionately pressed it	152.12524673167547
Faria smiled encouragingly on him and the young man retired to his task in the spirit of obedience and respect which he had sworn to show towards his aged friend	88.31751274659877
When Dants returned next morning to the chamber of his companion in captivity he found Faria seated and looking composed	195.1864612776158
In the ray of light which entered by the narrow window of his cell he held open in his left hand of which alone it will be recollected he retained the use a sheet of paper which from being constantly rolled into a small compass had the form of a cylinder and was not easily kept open	107.83603894086983
He did not speak but showed the paper to Dants	206.16238028493322
Look at it said the abb with a smile	10.835620375339541
I have looked at it with all possible attention said Dants and I only see a halfburnt paper on which are traces of Gothic characters inscribed with a peculiar kind of ink	260.73269959582694
This paper my friend said Faria I may now avow to you since I have the proof of your fidelitythis paper is my treasure of which from this day forth onehalf belongs to you	226.46622840794046
The sweat started forth on Dants brow	589.7707606325956
Until this day and for how long a timehe had refrained from talking of the treasure which had brought upon the abb the accusation of madness	207.30552171240367
With his instinctive delicacy Edmond had preferred avoiding any touch on this painful chord and Faria had been equally silent	385.13315415736355
He had taken the silence of the old man for a return to reason and now these few words uttered by Faria after so painful a crisis seemed to indicate a serious relapse into mental alienation	283.31435584643555
You have indeed a noble nature Edmond and I see by your paleness and agitation what is passing in your heart at this moment	73.64276439906484
No be assured I am not mad	44.14003636540319
This treasure exists Dants and if I have not been allowed to possess it you will	32.14547713735347
No one would listen or believe me because everyone thought me mad but you who must know that I am not listen to me and believe me so afterwards if you will	70.34229146188751
Alas murmured Edmond to himself this is a terrible relapse There was only this blow wanting	431.44671013169034
Then he said aloud My dear friend your attack has perhaps fatigued you had you not better repose awhile Tomorrow if you will I will hear your narrative but today I wish to nurse you carefully	309.17070731386355
Besides he said a treasure is not a thing we need hurry about	223.36606141821068
On the contrary it is a matter of the utmost importance Edmond replied the old man	69.39439454133338
Who knows if tomorrow or the next day after the third attack may not come on and then must not all be over Yes indeed I have often thought with a bitter joy that these riches which would make the wealth of a dozen families will be forever lost to those men who persecute me	113.49824869497319
This idea was one of vengeance to me and I tasted it slowly in the night of my dungeon and the despair of my captivity	96.01983805104325
But now I have forgiven the world for the love of you now that I see you young and with a promising futurenow that I think of all that may result to you in the good fortune of such a disclosure I shudder at any delay and tremble lest I should not assure to one as worthy as yourself the possession of so vast an amount of hidden wealth	125.72773833439369
Edmond turned away his head with a sigh	12.89859481153586
You persist in your incredulity Edmond continued Faria	4765.779287275724
My words have not convinced you	12.883406315681585
Well then read this paper which I have never shown to anyone	44.37621050283521
Tomorrow my dear friend said Edmond desirous of not yielding to the old mans madness	216.07430044911467
I thought it was understood that we should not talk of that until tomorrow	73.40393365694064
Then we will not talk of it until tomorrow but read this paper today	120.59121447318482
I will not irritate him thought Edmond and taking the paper of which half was wantinghaving been burnt no doubt by some accidenthe read	522.5020798598894
this treasure which may amount to two	82.22049775806911
of Roman crowns in the most distant a	200.193480059349
declare to belong to him alo	369174.2692766089
Well said Faria when the young man had finished reading it	40.66650854128587
Why replied Dants I see nothing but broken lines and unconnected words which are rendered illegible by fire	816.8799682439242
Yes to you my friend who read them for the first time but not for me who have grown pale over them by many nights study and have reconstructed every phrase completed every thought	285.902991319826
And do you believe you have discovered the hidden meaning	258.3669460656172
I am sure I have and you shall judge for yourself but first listen to the history of this paper	87.71973116505316
And Dants happy to escape the history and explanation which would be sure to confirm his belief in his friends mental instability glided like a snake along the narrow passage while Faria restored by his alarm to a certain amount of activity pushed the stone into place with his foot and covered it with a mat in order the more effectually to avoid discovery	257.8540977233471
It was the governor who hearing of Farias illness from the jailer had come in person to see him	161.76358052127998
Faria sat up to receive him avoiding all gestures in order that he might conceal from the governor the paralysis that had already half stricken him with death	275.45068693109016
His fear was lest the governor touched with pity might order him to be removed to better quarters and thus separate him from his young companion	220.9931223797427
But fortunately this was not the case and the governor left him convinced that the poor madman for whom in his heart he felt a kind of affection was only troubled with a slight indisposition	119.38500666191418
During this time Edmond seated on his bed with his head in his hands tried to collect his scattered thoughts	46.48234528508036
Faria since their first acquaintance had been on all points so rational and logical so wonderfully sagacious in fact that he could not understand how so much wisdom on all points could be allied with madness	195.5783218050581
Was Faria deceived as to his treasure or was all the world deceived as to Faria	230.56857722291022
Dants remained in his cell all day not daring to return to his friend thinking thus to defer the moment when he should be convinced once for all that the abb was madsuch a conviction would be so terrible	120.66515300077424
But towards the evening after the hour for the customary visit had gone by Faria not seeing the young man appear tried to move and get over the distance which separated them	107.01943235280464
Edmond shuddered when he heard the painful efforts which the old man made to drag himself along his leg was inert and he could no longer make use of one arm	128.42011741115942
Edmond was obliged to assist him for otherwise he would not have been able to enter by the small aperture which led to Dants chamber	47.983307094412424
Here I am pursuing you remorselessly he said with a benignant smile	210.00451308596985
You thought to escape my munificence but it is in vain	118.00072505222138
Edmond saw there was no escape and placing the old man on his bed he seated himself on the stool beside him	52.157570153051594
You know said the abb that I was the secretary and intimate friend of Cardinal Spada the last of the princes of that name	143.27309995326337
I owe to this worthy lord all the happiness I ever knew	164.25686539373672
He was not rich although the wealth of his family had passed into a proverb and I heard the phrase very often As rich as a Spada	134.13796318167465
But he like public rumor lived on this reputation for wealth his palace was my paradise	478.1544803613942
I was tutor to his nephews who are dead and when he was alone in the world I tried by absolute devotion to his will to make up to him all he had done for me during ten years of unremitting kindness	102.3082135992629
The cardinals house had no secrets for me	108.16201349803944
I had often seen my noble patron annotating ancient volumes and eagerly searching amongst dusty family manuscripts	7587.995926941455
One day when I was reproaching him for his unavailing searches and deploring the prostration of mind that followed them he looked at me and smiling bitterly opened a volume relating to the History of the City of Rome	369.0964857558958
There in the twentieth chapter of the Life of Pope Alexander VI	651.6599490774063
were the following lines which I can never forget	79.59702584844796
The great wars of Romagna had ended Csar Borgia who had completed his conquest had need of money to purchase all Italy	310.9639102402515
The pope had also need of money to bring matters to an end with Louis XII	210.62739607969667
King of France who was formidable still in spite of his recent reverses and it was necessary therefore to have recourse to some profitable scheme which was a matter of great difficulty in the impoverished condition of exhausted Italy	261.49478368351186
He determined to make two cardinals	8006.244093375406
By choosing two of the greatest personages of Rome especially rich menthis was the return the Holy Father looked for	578.3848249482977
In the first place he could sell the great appointments and splendid offices which the cardinals already held and then he had the two hats to sell besides	481.58681146719147
There was a third point in view which will appear hereafter	375.51954238923565
The pope and Csar Borgia first found the two future cardinals they were Giovanni Rospigliosi who held four of the highest dignities of the Holy See and Csar Spada one of the noblest and richest of the Roman nobility both felt the high honor of such a favor from the pope	306.88686696990504
They were ambitious and Csar Borgia soon found purchasers for their appointments	1275.023663842707
The result was that Rospigliosi and Spada paid for being cardinals and eight other persons paid for the offices the cardinals held before their elevation and thus eight hundred thousand crowns entered into the coffers of the speculators	272.6843171786688
It is time now to proceed to the last part of the speculation	109.6890084688262
The pope heaped attentions upon Rospigliosi and Spada conferred upon them the insignia of the cardinalate and induced them to arrange their affairs and take up their residence at Rome	279.49732555752445
Then the pope and Csar Borgia invited the two cardinals to dinner	342.43007359969306
This was a matter of dispute between the Holy Father and his son	132.40251380149687
Csar thought they could make use of one of the means which he always had ready for his friends that is to say in the first place the famous key which was given to certain persons with the request that they go and open a designated cupboard	80.49752150612873
This key was furnished with a small iron pointa negligence on the part of the locksmith	117.70907805602907
When this was pressed to effect the opening of the cupboard of which the lock was difficult the person was pricked by this small point and died next day	130.94097517200584
Then there was the ring with the lions head which Csar wore when he wanted to greet his friends with a clasp of the hand	151.21367031520958
The lion bit the hand thus favored and at the end of twentyfour hours the bite was mortal	278.3935235803289
Csar proposed to his father that they should either ask the cardinals to open the cupboard or shake hands with them but Alexander VI	351.527225602358
replied Now as to the worthy cardinals Spada and Rospigliosi let us ask both of them to dinner something tells me that we shall get that money back	241.1527216071497
Besides you forget Csar an indigestion declares itself immediately while a prick or a bite occasions a delay of a day or two	419.713659534938
Csar gave way before such cogent reasoning and the cardinals were consequently invited to dinner	811.1013367716956
The table was laid in a vineyard belonging to the pope near San Pierdarena a charming retreat which the cardinals knew very well by report	319.42554782570124
Rospigliosi quite set up with his new dignities went with a good appetite and his most ingratiating manner	244.5426476687256
Spada a prudent man and greatly attached to his only nephew a young captain of the highest promise took paper and pen and made his will	323.4309217389351
He then sent word to his nephew to wait for him near the vineyard but it appeared the servant did not find him	76.88556065976205
Spada knew what these invitations meant since Christianity so eminently civilizing had made progress in Rome it was no longer a centurion who came from the tyrant with a message Csar wills that you die	527.8998844415561
but it was a legate   latere who came with a smile on his lips to say from the pope His holiness requests you to dine with him	194.66404943655456
Spada set out about two oclock to San Pierdarena	270.75255003945557
The first sight that attracted the eyes of Spada was that of his nephew in full costume and Csar Borgia paying him most marked attentions	291.85560910136115
Spada turned pale as Csar looked at him with an ironical air which proved that he had anticipated all and that the snare was well spread	73.19498658706087
They began dinner and Spada was only able to inquire of his nephew if he had received his message	96.21639555416046
The nephew replied no perfectly comprehending the meaning of the question	116.10045466253641
It was too late for he had already drunk a glass of excellent wine placed for him expressly by the popes butler	278.31305323787535
Spada at the same moment saw another bottle approach him which he was pressed to taste	372.50548794636956
An hour afterwards a physician declared they were both poisoned through eating mushrooms	2275.7669806383547
Spada died on the threshold of the vineyard the nephew expired at his own door making signs which his wife could not comprehend	171.08459942529882
Then Csar and the pope hastened to lay hands on the heritage under pretense of seeking for the papers of the dead man	102.64747232056604
But the inheritance consisted in this only a scrap of paper on which Spada had writtenI bequeath to my beloved nephew my coffers my books and amongst others my breviary with the gold corners which I beg he will preserve in remembrance of his affectionate uncle	351.51620978862064
The heirs sought everywhere admired the breviary laid hands on the furniture and were greatly astonished that Spada the rich man was really the most miserable of unclesno treasuresunless they were those of science contained in the library and laboratories	315.39544140662883
Csar and his father searched examined scrutinized but found nothing or at least very little not exceeding a few thousand crowns in plate and about the same in ready money but the nephew had time to say to his wife before he expired Look well among my uncles papers there is a will	243.71028110131851
They sought even more thoroughly than the august heirs had done but it was fruitless	197.79263396388347
There were two palaces and a vineyard behind the Palatine Hill but in these days landed property had not much value and the two palaces and the vineyard remained to the family since they were beneath the rapacity of the pope and his son	223.5419451212397
died poisonedyou know by what mistake	1297.1290374279906
Csar poisoned at the same time escaped by shedding his skin like a snake but the new skin was spotted by the poison till it looked like a tigers	171.96270888948578
Then compelled to quit Rome he went and got himself obscurely killed in a night skirmish scarcely noticed in history	693.0704678413175
After the popes death and his sons exile it was supposed that the Spada family would resume the splendid position they had held before the cardinals time but this was not the case	248.32959381159483
The Spadas remained in doubtful ease a mystery hung over this dark affair and the public rumor was that Csar a better politician than his father had carried off from the pope the fortune of the two cardinals	247.8114464267482
I say the two because Cardinal Rospigliosi who had not taken any precaution was completely despoiled	500.26053839774505
Up to this point said Faria interrupting the thread of his narrative this seems to you very meaningless no doubt eh	434.5996965097057
Oh my friend cried Dants on the contrary it seems as if I were reading a most interesting narrative go on I beg of you	81.06789702171989
The family began to get accustomed to their obscurity	323.29433806232856
Years rolled on and amongst the descendants some were soldiers others diplomatists some churchmen some bankers some grew rich and some were ruined	1492.987388862799
I come now to the last of the family whose secretary I wasthe Count of Spada	295.00106385193646
I had often heard him complain of the disproportion of his rank with his fortune and I advised him to invest all he had in an annuity	164.61604030542136
He did so and thus doubled his income	1336.1246894465046
The celebrated breviary remained in the family and was in the counts possession	53.558391057431415
It had been handed down from father to son for the singular clause of the only will that had been found had caused it to be regarded as a genuine relic preserved in the family with superstitious veneration	300.0991477841338
It was an illuminated book with beautiful Gothic characters and so weighty with gold that a servant always carried it before the cardinal on days of great solemnity	391.2559656455508
At the sight of papers of all sortstitles contracts parchments which were kept in the archives of the family all descending from the poisoned cardinal I in my turn examined the immense bundles of documents like twenty servitors stewards secretaries before me but in spite of the most exhaustive researches I foundnothing	558.3542580209217
Yet I had read I had even written a precise history of the Borgia family for the sole purpose of assuring myself whether any increase of fortune had occurred to them on the death of the Cardinal Csar Spada but could only trace the acquisition of the property of the Cardinal Rospigliosi his companion in misfortune	200.92424415248288
I was then almost assured that the inheritance had neither profited the Borgias nor the family but had remained unpossessed like the treasures of the Arabian Nights which slept in the bosom of the earth under the eyes of the genie	166.00004141170768
I searched ransacked counted calculated a thousand and a thousand times the income and expenditure of the family for three hundred years	90.40791511538424
I remained in my ignorance and the Count of Spada in his poverty	102.91596699391044
He had reserved from his annuity his family papers his library composed of five thousand volumes and his famous breviary	513.5993766389328
All these he bequeathed to me with a thousand Roman crowns which he had in ready money on condition that I would have anniversary masses said for the repose of his soul and that I would draw up a genealogical tree and history of his house	131.56545891336316
Be easy my dear Edmond we are near the conclusion	175.0181810345579
In 1807 a month before I was arrested and a fortnight after the death of the Count of Spada on the 25th of December you will see presently how the date became fixed in my memory I was reading for the thousandth time the papers I was arranging for the palace was sold to a stranger and I was going to leave Rome and settle at Florence intending to take with me twelve thousand francs I possessed my library and the famous breviary when tired with my constant labor at the same thing and overcome by a heavy dinner I had eaten my head dropped on my hands and I fell asleep about three oclock in the afternoon	108.75735061410175
I awoke as the clock was striking six	126.74081462416073
I raised my head I was in utter darkness	122.89296193823776
I rang for a light but as no one came I determined to find one for myself	109.99837027769046
It was indeed but anticipating the simple manners which I should soon be under the necessity of adopting	130.86582662028897
I took a waxcandle in one hand and with the other groped about for a piece of paper my matchbox being empty with which I proposed to get a light from the small flame still playing on the embers	123.83728664165726
Fearing however to make use of any valuable piece of paper I hesitated for a moment then recollected that I had seen in the famous breviary which was on the table beside me an old paper quite yellow with age and which had served as a marker for centuries kept there by the request of the heirs	125.11502490626141
I felt for it found it twisted it up together and putting it into the expiring flame set light to it	298.585080548475
But beneath my fingers as if by magic in proportion as the fire ascended I saw yellowish characters appear on the paper	337.05103626768505
I grasped it in my hand put out the flame as quickly as I could lighted my taper in the fire itself and opened the crumpled paper with inexpressible emotion recognizing when I had done so that these characters had been traced in mysterious and sympathetic ink only appearing when exposed to the fire nearly onethird of the paper had been consumed by the flame	208.2674759795623
It was that paper you read this morning read it again Dants and then I will complete for you the incomplete words and unconnected sense	286.11726762009783
Faria with an air of triumph offered the paper to Dants who this time read the following words traced with an ink of a reddish color resembling rust	241.43453431678986
This 25th day of April 1498 be	902.0133549341411
he may desire to become my heir and re	504.22472100319595

may amount to nearly two mil	38531.3680627689
will find on raising the twentieth ro	93903.43261622895
creek to the east in a right line	133.9263246140001
in these caves the treasure is in the furthest a	174.67761096516728
which treasure I bequeath and leave en	8766.056868188456
And now said the abb read this other paper and he presented to Dants a second leaf with fragments of lines written on it which Edmond read as follows	327.9762697217581
ing invited to dine by his Holiness	1012.3647235974612

know of the existence of this treasure which	67.10124954697068
lions of Roman crowns and which he	26.884429725992163
Faria followed him with an excited look	639.6369715980572
And now he said when he saw that Dants had read the last line put the two fragments together and judge for yourself	113.23819779041636
Dants obeyed and the conjointed pieces gave the following	524.4598718454656
This 25th day of April 1498 be	902.0133549341411
ing invited to dine by his Holiness Alexander VI	7520.287192772162

ngle in the second which treasure I bequeath and leave en	2568.669859082681
tire to him as my sole heir	503.5874654445238
Well do you comprehend now inquired Faria	3203.3910076079687
It is the declaration of Cardinal Spada and the will so long sought for replied Edmond still incredulous	568.5559588699429
And who completed it as it now is	71.93835745941081
Aided by the remaining fragment I guessed the rest measuring the length of the lines by those of the paper and divining the hidden meaning by means of what was in part revealed as we are guided in a cavern by the small ray of light above us	136.89438317244077
And what did you do when you arrived at this conclusion	156.99978764917887
I resolved to set out and did set out at that very instant carrying with me the beginning of my great work the unity of the Italian kingdom but for some time the imperial police who at this period quite contrary to what Napoleon desired so soon as he had a son born to him wished for a partition of provinces had their eyes on me and my hasty departure the cause of which they were unable to guess having aroused their suspicions I was arrested at the very moment I was leaving Piombino	175.99859334347607
Now continued Faria addressing Dants with an almost paternal expression now my dear fellow you know as much as I do myself	38.64019787909694
If we ever escape together half this treasure is yours if I die here and you escape alone the whole belongs to you	150.51252521647558
But inquired Dants hesitating has this treasure no more legitimate possessor in the world than ourselves	284.15273109173864
No no be easy on that score the family is extinct	213.63149133331004
The last Count of Spada moreover made me his heir bequeathing to me this symbolic breviary he bequeathed to me all it contained no no make your mind satisfied on that point	366.9123725948251
If we lay hands on this fortune we may enjoy it without remorse	327.0610229762259
And you say this treasure amounts to	1223.0753038107925
Two millions of Roman crowns nearly thirteen millions of our money	133.33833866030196
Impossible said Dants staggered at the enormous amount	259.065041651395
Impossible and why asked the old man	8.31910844735489
The Spada family was one of the oldest and most powerful families of the fifteenth century and in those times when other opportunities for investment were wanting such accumulations of gold and jewels were by no means rare there are at this day Roman families perishing of hunger though possessed of nearly a million in diamonds and jewels handed down by entail and which they can not touch	305.9735529293163
Edmond thought he was in a dreamhe wavered between incredulity and joy	1946.0373966544141
I have only kept this secret so long from you continued Faria that I might test your character and then surprise you	158.07079991307052
Had we escaped before my attack of catalepsy I should have conducted you to Monte Cristo now he added with a sigh it is you who will conduct me thither	70.6912069450448
Well Dants you do not thank me	50.13126359792082
This treasure belongs to you my dear friend replied Dants and to you only	100.806369056119
I have no right to it	361.3854185465825
I am no relation of yours	762.1364169826363
You are my son Dants exclaimed the old man	21.968621752857345
You are the child of my captivity	639.5598105755139
My profession condemns me to celibacy	873935.8824929628
God has sent you to me to console at one and the same time the man who could not be a father and the prisoner who could not get free	47.61389579688388
And Faria extended the arm of which alone the use remained to him to the young man who threw himself upon his neck and wept	54.52978757384106
Now that this treasure which had so long been the object of the abbs meditations could insure the future happiness of him whom Faria really loved as a son it had doubled its value in his eyes and every day he expatiated on the amount explaining to Dants all the good which with thirteen or fourteen millions of francs a man could do in these days to his friends and then Dants countenance became gloomy for the oath of vengeance he had taken recurred to his memory and he reflected how much ill in these times a man with thirteen or fourteen millions could do to his enemies	157.50437541176402
The abb did not know the Island of Monte Cristo but Dants knew it and had often passed it situated twentyfive miles from Pianosa between Corsica and the Island of Elba and had once touched there	120.6305699365814
This island was always had been and still is completely deserted	364.97884800976794
It is a rock of almost conical form which looks as though it had been thrust up by volcanic force from the depth to the surface of the ocean	152.4459996180673
Dants drew a plan of the island for Faria and Faria gave Dants advice as to the means he should employ to recover the treasure	338.8722936582651
But Dants was far from being as enthusiastic and confident as the old man	148.55751232124103
It was past a question now that Faria was not a lunatic and the way in which he had achieved the discovery which had given rise to the suspicion of his madness increased Edmonds admiration of him but at the same time Dants could not believe that the deposit supposing it had ever existed still existed and though he considered the treasure as by no means chimerical he yet believed it was no longer there	172.76922210281143
However as if fate resolved on depriving the prisoners of their last chance and making them understand that they were condemned to perpetual imprisonment a new misfortune befell them the gallery on the sea side which had long been in ruins was rebuilt	233.37862334321065
They had repaired it completely and stopped up with vast masses of stone the hole Dants had partly filled in	277.6691786489147
But for this precaution which it will be remembered the abb had made to Edmond the misfortune would have been still greater for their attempt to escape would have been detected and they would undoubtedly have been separated	122.77254861182017
Thus a new a stronger and more inexorable barrier was interposed to cut off the realization of their hopes	264.94718694668114
You see said the young man with an air of sorrowful resignation to Faria that God deems it right to take from me any claim to merit for what you call my devotion to you	105.57209614902841
I have promised to remain forever with you and now I could not break my promise if I would	50.20312188096853
The treasure will be no more mine than yours and neither of us will quit this prison	105.16319753707137
But my real treasure is not that my dear friend which awaits me beneath the sombre rocks of Monte Cristo it is your presence our living together five or six hours a day in spite of our jailers it is the rays of intelligence you have elicited from my brain the languages you have implanted in my memory and which have taken root there with all their philological ramifications	168.2584379593401
These different sciences that you have made so easy to me by the depth of the knowledge you possess of them and the clearness of the principles to which you have reduced themthis is my treasure my beloved friend and with this you have made me rich and happy	84.83903521015782
Believe me and take comfort this is better for me than tons of gold and cases of diamonds even were they not as problematical as the clouds we see in the morning floating over the sea which we take for terra firma and which evaporate and vanish as we draw near to them	228.68642781900536
To have you as long as possible near me to hear your eloquent speechwhich embellishes my mind strengthens my soul and makes my whole frame capable of great and terrible things if I should ever be freeso fills my whole existence that the despair to which I was just on the point of yielding when I knew you has no longer any hold over me and thisthis is my fortunenot chimerical but actual	282.71224817436035
I owe you my real good my present happiness and all the sovereigns of the earth even Csar Borgia himself could not deprive me of this	95.32425035640354
Thus if not actually happy yet the days these two unfortunates passed together went quickly	574.3481088483385
Faria who for so long a time had kept silence as to the treasure now perpetually talked of it	193.13133917902528
As he had prophesied would be the case he remained paralyzed in the right arm and the left leg and had given up all hope of ever enjoying it himself	112.48267776763639
But he was continually thinking over some means of escape for his young companion and anticipating the pleasure he would enjoy	165.2897671688152
For fear the letter might be some day lost or stolen he compelled Dants to learn it by heart and Dants knew it from the first to the last word	185.90348604813087
Then he destroyed the second portion assured that if the first were seized no one would be able to discover its real meaning	128.33600348585463
Whole hours sometimes passed while Faria was giving instructions to Dantsinstructions which were to serve him when he was at liberty	176.454336000938
Then once free from the day and hour and moment when he was so he could have but one only thought which was to gain Monte Cristo by some means and remain there alone under some pretext which would arouse no suspicions and once there to endeavor to find the wonderful caverns and search in the appointed spotthe appointed spot be it remembered being the farthest angle in the second opening	212.3917131839349
In the meanwhile the hours passed if not rapidly at least tolerably	286.8106319060931
Faria as we have said without having recovered the use of his hand and foot had regained all the clearness of his understanding and had gradually besides the moral instructions we have detailed taught his youthful companion the patient and sublime duty of a prisoner who learns to make something from nothing	217.84208569010752
They were thus perpetually employedFaria that he might not see himself grow old Dants for fear of recalling the almost extinct past which now only floated in his memory like a distant light wandering in the night	232.9461872373333
So life went on for them as it does for those who are not victims of misfortune and whose activities glide along mechanically and tranquilly beneath the eye of Providence	244.991809965761
But beneath this superficial calm there were in the heart of the young man and perhaps in that of the old man many repressed desires many stifled sighs which found vent when Faria was left alone and when Edmond returned to his cell	143.12534494126044
One night Edmond awoke suddenly believing that he heard someone calling him	211.589925696114
He opened his eyes upon utter darkness	3648.9863814035693
His name or rather a plaintive voice which essayed to pronounce his name reached him	294.4922580105436
He sat up in bed and a cold sweat broke out upon his brow	60.04847024035025
Undoubtedly the call came from Farias dungeon	59106.14124548584
Alas murmured Edmond can it be	8.461213163241418
He moved his bed drew up the stone rushed into the passage and reached the opposite extremity the secret entrance was open	39.654020704101185
By the light of the wretched and wavering lamp of which we have spoken Dants saw the old man pale but yet erect clinging to the bedstead	231.49740183515104
His features were writhing with those horrible symptoms which he already knew and which had so seriously alarmed him when he saw them for the first time	85.36914080756638
Alas my dear friend said Faria in a resigned tone you understand do you not and I need not attempt to explain to you	55.31244048855062
Edmond uttered a cry of agony and quite out of his senses rushed towards the door exclaiming Help help	125.54202656108885
Faria had just sufficient strength to restrain him	20.48692086141256
Silence he said or you are lost	98.97888737241814
We must now only think of you my dear friend and so act as to render your captivity supportable or your flight possible	175.99624064322637
It would require years to do again what I have done here and the results would be instantly destroyed if our jailers knew we had communicated with each other	138.94826415592468
Besides be assured my dear Edmond the dungeon I am about to leave will not long remain empty some other unfortunate being will soon take my place and to him you will appear like an angel of salvation	163.3687511573858
Perhaps he will be young strong and enduring like yourself and will aid you in your escape while I have been but a hindrance	140.81587046755467
You will no longer have half a dead body tied to you as a drag to all your movements	154.09858829855057
At length Providence has done something for you he restores to you more than he takes away and it was time I should die	115.2891338398982
Edmond could only clasp his hands and exclaim Oh my friend my friend speak not thus and then resuming all his presence of mind which had for a moment staggered under this blow and his strength which had failed at the words of the old man he said Oh I have saved you once and I will save you a second time And raising the foot of the bed he drew out the phial still a third filled with the red liquor	63.039131357945166
See he exclaimed there remains still some of the magic draught	286.68784025439135
Quick quick tell me what I must do this time are there any fresh instructions Speak my friend I listen	174.90124586951808
There is not a hope replied Faria shaking his head but no matter God wills it that man whom he has created and in whose heart he has so profoundly rooted the love of life should do all in his power to preserve that existence which however painful it may be is yet always so dear	171.58213268463768
Oh yes yes exclaimed Dants and I tell you that I will save you yet	25.230821340545848
I feel the blood flowing towards my brain	74.36316726901475
These horrible chills which make my teeth chatter and seem to dislocate my bones begin to pervade my whole frame in five minutes the malady will reach its height and in a quarter of an hour there will be nothing left of me but a corpse	129.98839740935162
Oh exclaimed Dants his heart wrung with anguish	202.30179361772622
Do as you did before only do not wait so long all the springs of life are now exhausted in me and death he continued looking at his paralyzed arm and leg has but half its work to do	134.8215447249761
If after having made me swallow twelve drops instead of ten you see that I do not recover then pour the rest down my throat	280.8820612209216
Now lift me on my bed for I can no longer support myself	55.754582306788336
Edmond took the old man in his arms and laid him on the bed	19.389354463456332
And now my dear friend said Faria sole consolation of my wretched existenceyou whom Heaven gave me somewhat late but still gave me a priceless gift and for which I am most gratefulat the moment of separating from you forever I wish you all the happiness and all the prosperity you so well deserve	250.05493041480167
The young man cast himself on his knees leaning his head against the old mans bed	17.406909056038828
Listen now to what I say in this my dying moment	219.88447355989018
The treasure of the Spadas exists	37595.70449006773
God grants me the boon of vision unrestricted by time or space	1128.6701514234821
I see it in the depths of the inner cavern	141.67427515149052
My eyes pierce the inmost recesses of the earth and are dazzled at the sight of so much riches	94.10894819708265
If you do escape remember that the poor abb whom all the world called mad was not so	77.78659213977966
Hasten to Monte Cristoavail yourself of the fortunefor you have indeed suffered long enough	258.571964044453
A violent convulsion attacked the old man	7.548176253834962
Dants raised his head and saw Farias eyes injected with blood	1173.2219835132369
It seemed as if a flow of blood had ascended from the chest to the head	77.91296265327613
Adieu adieu murmured the old man clasping Edmonds hand convulsivelyadieu	842.7584162936192
Oh nono not yet he cried do not forsake me Oh succor him Helphelphelp	455.3507257363713
Hush hush murmured the dying man that they may not separate us if you save me	53.81030288160035
Oh yes yes be assured I shall save you Besides although you suffer much you do not seem to be in such agony as you were before	71.51758895573066
Do not mistake I suffer less because there is in me less strength to endure	288.4307459716597
At your age we have faith in life it is the privilege of youth to believe and hope but old men see death more clearly	159.81462700937553
Oh tis heretis heretis overmy sight is gonemy senses fail Your hand Dants Adieu adieu	6876.722234468761
And raising himself by a final effort in which he summoned all his faculties he saidMonte Cristo forget not Monte Cristo And he fell back on the bed	116.57099008061576
The crisis was terrible and a rigid form with twisted limbs swollen eyelids and lips flecked with bloody foam lay on the bed of torture in place of the intellectual being who so lately rested there	330.7241473497761
Dants took the lamp placed it on a projecting stone above the bed whence its tremulous light fell with strange and fantastic ray on the distorted countenance and motionless stiffened body	360.6387666437527
With steady gaze he awaited confidently the moment for administering the restorative	1301.5140473350564
When he believed that the right moment had arrived he took the knife pried open the teeth which offered less resistance than before counted one after the other twelve drops and watched the phial contained perhaps twice as much more	269.5365247848639
He waited ten minutes a quarter of an hour half an hourno change took place	118.5920601451702
Trembling his hair erect his brow bathed with perspiration he counted the seconds by the beating of his heart	54.753327509585034
Then he thought it was time to make the last trial and he put the phial to the purple lips of Faria and without having occasion to force open his jaws which had remained extended he poured the whole of the liquid down his throat	94.22791820001372
The draught produced a galvanic effect a violent trembling pervaded the old mans limbs his eyes opened until it was fearful to gaze upon them he heaved a sigh which resembled a shriek and then his convulsed body returned gradually to its former immobility the eyes remaining open	199.9063223377409
Half an hour an hour an hour and a half elapsed and during this period of anguish Edmond leaned over his friend his hand applied to his heart and felt the body gradually grow cold and the hearts pulsation become more and more deep and dull until at length it stopped the last movement of the heart ceased the face became livid the eyes remained open but the eyeballs were glazed	138.82218845719487
It was six oclock in the morning the dawn was just breaking and its feeble ray came into the dungeon and paled the ineffectual light of the lamp	215.58824271879908
Strange shadows passed over the countenance of the dead man and at times gave it the appearance of life	59.18060482205619
While the struggle between day and night lasted Dants still doubted but as soon as the daylight gained the preeminence he saw that he was alone with a corpse	121.70654733310344
Then an invincible and extreme terror seized upon him and he dared not again press the hand that hung out of bed he dared no longer to gaze on those fixed and vacant eyes which he tried many times to close but in vainthey opened again as soon as shut	147.7499745179265
He extinguished the lamp carefully concealed it and then went away closing as well as he could the entrance to the secret passage by the large stone as he descended	65.69840226423233
It was time for the jailer was coming	402.15456442706903
On this occasion he began his rounds at Dants cell and on leaving him he went on to Farias dungeon taking thither breakfast and some linen	642.4906491230798
Nothing betokened that the man knew anything of what had occurred	73.97931027065067
Dants was then seized with an indescribable desire to know what was going on in the dungeon of his unfortunate friend	57.76956238177107
He therefore returned by the subterraneous gallery and arrived in time to hear the exclamations of the turnkey who called out for help	203.68270341593035
Other turnkeys came and then was heard the regular tramp of soldiers	271.064340760283
Last of all came the governor	5007.0269903778135
Edmond heard the creaking of the bed as they moved the corpse heard the voice of the governor who asked them to throw water on the dead mans face and seeing that in spite of this application the prisoner did not recover they sent for the doctor	91.08796023697487
The governor then went out and words of pity fell on Dants listening ears mingled with brutal laughter	400.4443117853679
Well well said one the madman has gone to look after his treasure	201.44460991560868
With all his millions he will not have enough to pay for his shroud said another	104.29131273810187
Oh added a third voice the shrouds of the Chteau dIf are not dear	117.55119830916462
Perhaps said one of the previous speakers as he was a churchman they may go to some expense in his behalf	225.08797419768112
They may give him the honors of the sack	215.1342853636463
Edmond did not lose a word but comprehended very little of what was said	206.66096266788574
The voices soon ceased and it seemed to him as if everyone had left the cell	34.66024606434034
Still he dared not to enter as they might have left some turnkey to watch the dead	157.34990463597464
He remained therefore mute and motionless hardly venturing to breathe	601.9055367345662
At the end of an hour he heard a faint noise which increased	30.993461450449367
It was the governor who returned followed by the doctor and other attendants	92.97354321200642
There was a moments silenceit was evident that the doctor was examining the dead body	43.94682875967185
The doctor analyzed the symptoms of the malady to which the prisoner had succumbed and declared that he was dead	90.28730825729944
Questions and answers followed in a nonchalant manner that made Dants indignant for he felt that all the world should have for the poor abb a love and respect equal to his own	124.99580522809033
I am very sorry for what you tell me said the governor replying to the assurance of the doctor that the old man is really dead for he was a quiet inoffensive prisoner happy in his folly and required no watching	117.33125115668243
Ah added the turnkey there was no occasion for watching him he would have stayed here fifty years Ill answer for it without any attempt to escape	75.76237036780032
Still said the governor I believe it will be requisite notwithstanding your certainty and not that I doubt your science but in discharge of my official duty that we should be perfectly assured that the prisoner is dead	152.60043198362462
There was a moment of complete silence during which Dants still listening knew that the doctor was examining the corpse a second time	116.67116543794789
You may make your mind easy said the doctor he is dead	41.31456403219869
You know sir said the governor persisting that we are not content in such cases as this with such a simple examination	197.21972749305053
In spite of all appearances be so kind therefore as to finish your duty by fulfilling the formalities described by law	322.5364632009748
Let the irons be heated said the doctor but really it is a useless precaution	72.71190894869716
This order to heat the irons made Dants shudder	1309.1691580695415
He heard hasty steps the creaking of a door people going and coming and some minutes afterwards a turnkey entered saying	554.3947302202394
There was a moments silence and then was heard the crackling of burning flesh of which the peculiar and nauseous smell penetrated even behind the wall where Dants was listening in horror	285.11054492181063
The perspiration poured forth upon the young mans brow and he felt as if he should faint	27.218342495361856
You see sir he is really dead said the doctor this burn in the heel is decisive	225.09745244622212
The poor fool is cured of his folly and delivered from his captivity	136.95481295069092
Was nt his name Faria inquired one of the officers who accompanied the governor	73.21483849165278
Yes sir and as he said it was an ancient name	56.38903826764612
He was too very learned and rational enough on all points which did not relate to his treasure but on that indeed he was intractable	185.20802969450855
It is the sort of malady which we call monomania said the doctor	360.1798337131716
You had never anything to complain of said the governor to the jailer who had charge of the abb	103.14904719271864
Never sir replied the jailer never on the contrary he sometimes amused me very much by telling me stories	193.23563378816334
One day too when my wife was ill he gave me a prescription which cured her	143.89892204553365
Ah ah said the doctor I did not know that I had a rival but I hope governor that you will show him all proper respect in consequence	100.9426397031555
Yes yes make your mind easy he shall be decently interred in the newest sack we can find	484.71163398400415
Must this last formality take place in your presence sir inquired a turnkey	86.31245007549452
But make hasteI can not stay here all day	150.44198390224668
Other footsteps going and coming were now heard and a moment afterwards the noise of rustling canvas reached Dants ears the bed creaked and the heavy footfall of a man who lifts a weight sounded on the floor then the bed again creaked under the weight deposited upon it	212.97867417824668
Will there be any mass asked one of the attendants	120.64596708090069
That is impossible replied the governor	938.7974275404241
The chaplain of the chteau came to me yesterday to beg for leave of absence in order to take a trip to Hyres for a week	113.8701187069682
I told him I would attend to the prisoners in his absence	89.10947568477987
If the poor abb had not been in such a hurry he might have had his requiem	63.013962148518196
Pooh pooh said the doctor with the impiety usual in persons of his profession he is a churchman	201.54379857719334
God will respect his profession and not give the devil the wicked delight of sending him a priest	193.9437166860562
A shout of laughter followed this brutal jest	3585.465483109865
Meanwhile the operation of putting the body in the sack was going on	81.40410367257218
This evening said the governor when the task was ended	166.15928754347283
At what hour inquired a turnkey	18410.717515261615
Why about ten or eleven oclock	11.584656655550564
Shall we watch by the corpse	289.1542374682545
Of what use would it be Shut the dungeon as if he were alivethat is all	189.24415654502008
Then the steps retreated and the voices died away in the distance the noise of the door with its creaking hinges and bolts ceased and a silence more sombre than that of solitude ensuedthe silence of death which was allpervasive and struck its icy chill to the very soul of Dants	223.8595873186605
Then he raised the flagstone cautiously with his head and looked carefully around the chamber	111.2934397826076
It was empty and Dants emerged from the tunnel	518.6563937368669
The Cemetery of the Chteau dIf	2.498559990047768
On the bed at full length and faintly illuminated by the pale light that came from the window lay a sack of canvas and under its rude folds was stretched a long and stiffened form it was Farias last windingsheeta windingsheet which as the turnkey said cost so little	402.0044673075943
A barrier had been placed between Dants and his old friend	107.71039966541878
No longer could Edmond look into those wideopen eyes which had seemed to be penetrating the mysteries of death no longer could he clasp the hand which had done so much to make his existence blessed	125.33336642918314
Faria the beneficent and cheerful companion with whom he was accustomed to live so intimately no longer breathed	112.25072249135602
He seated himself on the edge of that terrible bed and fell into melancholy and gloomy reverie	102.93986469728826
Alone he was alone again again condemned to silenceagain face to face with nothingness Alonenever again to see the face never again to hear the voice of the only human being who united him to earth Was not Farias fate the better after allto solve the problem of life at its source even at the risk of horrible suffering	409.40227714045886
The idea of suicide which his friend had driven away and kept away by his cheerful presence now hovered like a phantom over the abbs dead body	264.09534708007936
If I could die he said I should go where he goes and should assuredly find him again	139.58615454821572
But how to die It is very easy he went on with a smile I will remain here rush on the first person that opens the door strangle him and then they will guillotine me	120.75828640075116
But excessive grief is like a storm at sea where the frail bark is tossed from the depths to the top of the wave	123.97655837777876
Dants recoiled from the idea of so infamous a death and passed suddenly from despair to an ardent desire for life and liberty	198.77786383168808
Die oh no he exclaimednot die now after having lived and suffered so long and so much Die yes had I died years ago but now to die would be indeed to give way to the sarcasm of destiny	131.59241431614186
No I want to live I shall struggle to the very last I will yet win back the happiness of which I have been deprived	113.70323566846199
Before I die I must not forget that I have my executioners to punish and perhaps too who knows some friends to reward	186.76882040725627
Yet they will forget me here and I shall die in my dungeon like Faria	62.425067086513295
As he said this he became silent and gazed straight before him like one overwhelmed with a strange and amazing thought	274.4494904845518
Suddenly he arose lifted his hand to his brow as if his brain were giddy paced twice or thrice round the dungeon and then paused abruptly by the bed	154.10407238285296
Just God he muttered whence comes this thought Is it from thee Since none but the dead pass freely from this dungeon let me take the place of the dead	244.42910184873304
Without giving himself time to reconsider his decision and indeed that he might not allow his thoughts to be distracted from his desperate resolution he bent over the appalling shroud opened it with the knife which Faria had made drew the corpse from the sack and bore it along the tunnel to his own chamber laid it on his couch tied around its head the rag he wore at night around his own covered it with his counterpane once again kissed the icecold brow and tried vainly to close the resisting eyes which glared horribly turned the head towards the wall so that the jailer might when he brought the evening meal believe that he was asleep as was his frequent custom entered the tunnel again drew the bed against the wall returned to the other cell took from the hidingplace the needle and thread flung off his rags that they might feel only naked flesh beneath the coarse canvas and getting inside the sack placed himself in the posture in which the dead body had been laid and sewed up the mouth of the sack from the inside	215.99217849287373
He would have been discovered by the beating of his heart if by any mischance the jailers had entered at that moment	101.3806000157644
Dants might have waited until the evening visit was over but he was afraid that the governor would change his mind and order the dead body to be removed earlier	194.66688967390073
In that case his last hope would have been destroyed	62.78852411752947
Now his plans were fully made and this is what he intended to do	36.997656006971454
If while he was being carried out the gravediggers should discover that they were bearing a live instead of a dead body Dants did not intend to give them time to recognize him but with a sudden cut of the knife he meant to open the sack from top to bottom and profiting by their alarm escape if they tried to catch him he would use his knife to better purpose	146.86234950776756
If they took him to the cemetery and laid him in a grave he would allow himself to be covered with earth and then as it was night the gravediggers could scarcely have turned their backs before he would have worked his way through the yielding soil and escaped	113.05157830065558
He hoped that the weight of earth would not be so great that he could not overcome it	35.82043406284256
If he was detected in this and the earth proved too heavy he would be stifled and thenso much the better all would be over	252.21785106259122
Dants had not eaten since the preceding evening but he had not thought of hunger nor did he think of it now	49.92450250582732
His situation was too precarious to allow him even time to reflect on any thought but one	140.13807337943066
The first risk that Dants ran was that the jailer when he brought him his supper at seven oclock might perceive the change that had been made fortunately twenty times at least from misanthropy or fatigue Dants had received his jailer in bed and then the man placed his bread and soup on the table and went away without saying a word	148.80392308598616
This time the jailer might not be as silent as usual but speak to Dants and seeing that he received no reply go to the bed and thus discover all	99.5368922932696
When seven oclock came Dants agony really began	4006.0710058603527
His hand placed upon his heart was unable to redress its throbbings while with the other he wiped the perspiration from his temples	102.00844353464889
From time to time chills ran through his whole body and clutched his heart in a grasp of ice	129.38033132737215
Then he thought he was going to die	34.823734063467114
Yet the hours passed on without any unusual disturbance and Dants knew that he had escaped the first peril	150.90802452156754
At length about the hour the governor had appointed footsteps were heard on the stairs	132.30921820307734
Edmond felt that the moment had arrived summoned up all his courage held his breath and would have been happy if at the same time he could have repressed the throbbing of his veins	68.1689278610355
The footstepsthey were doublepaused at the doorand Dants guessed that the two gravediggers had come to seek himthis idea was soon converted into certainty when he heard the noise they made in putting down the handbier	280.10429691819013
The door opened and a dim light reached Dants eyes through the coarse sack that covered him he saw two shadows approach his bed a third remaining at the door with a torch in its hand	99.41516356495957
The two men approaching the ends of the bed took the sack by its extremities	205.58513658130263
He s heavy though for an old and thin man said one as he raised the head	117.88840604879496
They say every year adds half a pound to the weight of the bones said another lifting the feet	279.8035142916865
Have you tied the knot inquired the first speaker	201.86296657639812
What would be the use of carrying so much more weight was the reply I can do that when we get there	107.3032514700369
Yes you re right replied the companion	270.0193051075064
What s the knot for thought Dants	5690.261903057915
They deposited the supposed corpse on the bier	161.62774428173648
Edmond stiffened himself in order to play the part of a dead man and then the party lighted by the man with the torch who went first ascended the stairs	83.1169991880795
Suddenly he felt the fresh and sharp night air and Dants knew that the mistral was blowing	310.82393897946935
It was a sensation in which pleasure and pain were strangely mingled	736.715933311962
The bearers went on for twenty paces then stopped putting the bier down on the ground	74.86360492121436
One of them went away and Dants heard his shoes striking on the pavement	153.3909929104391
Where am I he asked himself	84.57262445303658
Really he is by no means a light load said the other bearer sitting on the edge of the handbarrow	174.6560256096332
Dants first impulse was to escape but fortunately he did not attempt it	114.39020208786677
Give us a light said the other bearer or I shall never find what I am looking for	64.20518935095325
The man with the torch complied although not asked in the most polite terms	965.3798256661847
What can he be looking for thought Edmond	279.02050397061265
An exclamation of satisfaction indicated that the gravedigger had found the object of his search	75.73692640404214
Here it is at last he said not without some trouble though	131.87581244248108
Yes was the answer but it has lost nothing by waiting	194.25614738385917
As he said this the man came towards Edmond who heard a heavy metallic substance laid down beside him and at the same moment a cord was fastened round his feet with sudden and painful violence	153.43897781462746
Well have you tied the knot inquired the gravedigger who was looking on	175.53035741755977
Yes and pretty tight too I can tell you was the answer	52.26060239895341
And the bier was lifted once more and they proceeded	132.75218195070218
They advanced fifty paces farther and then stopped to open a door then went forward again	39.21300747503193
The noise of the waves dashing against the rocks on which the chteau is built reached Dants ear distinctly as they went forward	315.9221993630482
Bad weather observed one of the bearers not a pleasant night for a dip in the sea	214.43953622185276
Why yes the abb runs a chance of being wet said the other and then there was a burst of brutal laughter	114.48100680836299
Dants did not comprehend the jest but his hair stood erect on his head	108.24680559478665
Well here we are at last said one of them	33.803024704023926
A little farthera little farther said the other	72.73649551271728
You know very well that the last was stopped on his way dashed on the rocks and the governor told us next day that we were careless fellows	171.9392159370145
They ascended five or six more steps and then Dants felt that they took him one by the head and the other by the heels and swung him to and fro	103.32989266701772
One said the gravediggers two three	669.2051340612367
And at the same instant Dants felt himself flung into the air like a wounded bird falling falling with a rapidity that made his blood curdle	349.33418089616276
Although drawn downwards by the heavy weight which hastened his rapid descent it seemed to him as if the fall lasted for a century	119.73470144652106
At last with a horrible splash he darted like an arrow into the icecold water and as he did so he uttered a shrill cry stifled in a moment by his immersion beneath the waves	194.0300804980326
Dants had been flung into the sea and was dragged into its depths by a thirtysixpound shot tied to his feet	74.4062691440893
The sea is the cemetery of the Chteau dIf	16.97873723935821
Dants although stunned and almost suffocated had sufficient presence of mind to hold his breath and as his right hand prepared as he was for every chance held his knife open he rapidly ripped up the sack extricated his arm and then his body but in spite of all his efforts to free himself from the shot he felt it dragging him down still lower	166.80433400716757
He then bent his body and by a desperate effort severed the cord that bound his legs at the moment when it seemed as if he were actually strangled	136.3744659873943
With a mighty leap he rose to the surface of the sea while the shot dragged down to the depths the sack that had so nearly become his shroud	115.83361174999285
Dants waited only to get breath and then dived in order to avoid being seen	190.031322497276
When he arose a second time he was fifty paces from where he had first sunk	140.92570018902688
He saw overhead a black and tempestuous sky across which the wind was driving clouds that occasionally suffered a twinkling star to appear before him was the vast expanse of waters sombre and terrible whose waves foamed and roared as if before the approach of a storm	522.9495799007952
Behind him blacker than the sea blacker than the sky rose phantomlike the vast stone structure whose projecting crags seemed like arms extended to seize their prey and on the highest rock was a torch lighting two figures	475.6402839876377
He fancied that these two forms were looking at the sea doubtless these strange gravediggers had heard his cry	308.3079812181633
Dants dived again and remained a long time beneath the water	74.13553786326003
This was an easy feat to him for he usually attracted a crowd of spectators in the bay before the lighthouse at Marseilles when he swam there and was unanimously declared to be the best swimmer in the port	156.01742601002752
When he came up again the light had disappeared	59.92730578704017
He must now get his bearings	9477.079420022375
Ratonneau and Pomgue are the nearest islands of all those that surround the Chteau dIf but Ratonneau and Pomgue are inhabited as is also the islet of Daume	663.3398253350701
Tiboulen and Lemaire were therefore the safest for Dants venture	2124.9070420732924
The islands of Tiboulen and Lemaire are a league from the Chteau dIf Dants nevertheless determined to make for them	333.3731716823783
But how could he find his way in the darkness of the night	23.89450708063448
At this moment he saw the light of Planier gleaming in front of him like a star	204.42652074817295
By leaving this light on the right he kept the Island of Tiboulen a little on the left by turning to the left therefore he would find it	100.01201965609273
But as we have said it was at least a league from the Chteau dIf to this island	52.48008468107767
Often in prison Faria had said to him when he saw him idle and inactive	108.69634546443753
Dants you must not give way to this listlessness you will be drowned if you seek to escape and your strength has not been properly exercised and prepared for exertion	179.69533081506262
These words rang in Dants ears even beneath the waves he hastened to cleave his way through them to see if he had not lost his strength	68.24632586816209
He found with pleasure that his captivity had taken away nothing of his power and that he was still master of that element on whose bosom he had so often sported as a boy	112.26843927802786
Fear that relentless pursuer clogged Dants efforts	4447.041725555542
He listened for any sound that might be audible and every time that he rose to the top of a wave he scanned the horizon and strove to penetrate the darkness	96.12579579098458
He fancied that every wave behind him was a pursuing boat and he redoubled his exertions increasing rapidly his distance from the chteau but exhausting his strength	466.84520737784226
He swam on still and already the terrible chteau had disappeared in the darkness	144.69703905773238
He could not see it but he felt its presence	229.74988540075535
An hour passed during which Dants excited by the feeling of freedom continued to cleave the waves	304.63755031562226
Let us see said he I have swum above an hour but as the wind is against me that has retarded my speed however if I am not mistaken I must be close to Tiboulen	152.8265976849654
But what if I were mistaken	278.5101802981006
He sought to tread water in order to rest himself but the sea was too violent and he felt that he could not make use of this means of recuperation	61.04231800008338
Well said he I will swim on until I am worn out or the cramp seizes me and then I shall sink and he struck out with the energy of despair	174.45105110097316
Suddenly the sky seemed to him to become still darker and more dense and heavy clouds seemed to sweep down towards him at the same time he felt a sharp pain in his knee	98.9143015113811
He fancied for a moment that he had been shot and listened for the report but he heard nothing	52.77790232392287
Then he put out his hand and encountered an obstacle and with another stroke knew that he had gained the shore	176.52430306281514
Before him rose a grotesque mass of rocks that resembled nothing so much as a vast fire petrified at the moment of its most fervent combustion	198.10592007530383
It was the Island of Tiboulen	35668.77262274262
Dants rose advanced a few steps and with a fervent prayer of gratitude stretched himself on the granite which seemed to him softer than down	190.47757504396967
Then in spite of the wind and rain he fell into the deep sweet sleep of utter exhaustion	160.1060240083229
At the expiration of an hour Edmond was awakened by the roar of thunder	47.78757924986428
The tempest was let loose and beating the atmosphere with its mighty wings from time to time a flash of lightning stretched across the heavens like a fiery serpent lighting up the clouds that rolled on in vast chaotic waves	242.7904534246589
Dants had not been deceivedhe had reached the first of the two islands which was in fact Tiboulen	136.504190864201
He knew that it was barren and without shelter but when the sea became more calm he resolved to plunge into its waves again and swim to Lemaire equally arid but larger and consequently better adapted for concealment	709.9476125861894
An overhanging rock offered him a temporary shelter and scarcely had he availed himself of it when the tempest burst forth in all its fury	181.64090090224437
Edmond felt the trembling of the rock beneath which he lay the waves dashing themselves against it wetted him with their spray	386.3318927752431
He was safely sheltered and yet he felt dizzy in the midst of the warring of the elements and the dazzling brightness of the lightning	105.44917239828634
It seemed to him that the island trembled to its base and that it would like a vessel at anchor break moorings and bear him off into the centre of the storm	189.62102767540284
He then recollected that he had not eaten or drunk for fourandtwenty hours	456.7274652343771
He extended his hands and drank greedily of the rainwater that had lodged in a hollow of the rock	489.0917696032606
As he rose a flash of lightning that seemed to rive the remotest heights of heaven illumined the darkness	220.44433709890515
By its light between the Island of Lemaire and Cape Croiselle a quarter of a league distant Dants saw a fishingboat driven rapidly like a spectre before the power of winds and waves	234.52888580487243
A second after he saw it again approaching with frightful rapidity	97.92416852912334
Dants cried at the top of his voice to warn them of their danger but they saw it themselves	131.85543765574846
Another flash showed him four men clinging to the shattered mast and the rigging while a fifth clung to the broken rudder	421.98883677510537
The men he beheld saw him undoubtedly for their cries were carried to his ears by the wind	178.1383032184721
Above the splintered mast a sail rent to tatters was waving suddenly the ropes that still held it gave way and it disappeared in the darkness of the night like a vast seabird	279.0745734524977
At the same moment a violent crash was heard and cries of distress	201.1819263385352
Dants from his rocky perch saw the shattered vessel and among the fragments the floating forms of the hapless sailors	448.0497017207723
Dants ran down the rocks at the risk of being himself dashed to pieces he listened he groped about but he heard and saw nothingthe cries had ceased and the tempest continued to rage	244.85600540339922
By degrees the wind abated vast gray clouds rolled towards the west and the blue firmament appeared studded with bright stars	246.37133876197782
Soon a red streak became visible in the horizon the waves whitened a light played over them and gilded their foaming crests with gold	287.4895882806079
Dants stood mute and motionless before this majestic spectacle as if he now beheld it for the first time and indeed since his captivity in the Chteau dIf he had forgotten that such scenes were ever to be witnessed	120.44230722187196
He turned towards the fortress and looked at both sea and land	174.47965597146325
The gloomy building rose from the bosom of the ocean with imposing majesty and seemed to dominate the scene	159.18048021471736
The sea continued to get calmer	67715.19965098746
In two or three hours thought Dants the turnkey will enter my chamber find the body of my poor friend recognize it seek for me in vain and give the alarm	226.18071804440768
Then the tunnel will be discovered the men who cast me into the sea and who must have heard the cry I uttered will be questioned	85.8845840390582
Then boats filled with armed soldiers will pursue the wretched fugitive	503.6559569552301
The cannon will warn everyone to refuse shelter to a man wandering about naked and famished	1089.453178241838
The police of Marseilles will be on the alert by land whilst the governor pursues me by sea	271.4234637093388
I am cold I am hungry	372.99999539113077
I have lost even the knife that saved me	357.01251640451346
Oh my God I have suffered enough surely Have pity on me and do for me what I am unable to do for myself	75.61285848239376
As Dants his eyes turned in the direction of the Chteau dIf uttered this prayer he saw off the farther point of the Island of Pomgue a small vessel with lateen sail skimming the sea like a gull in search of prey and with his sailors eye he knew it to be a Genoese tartan	200.07349273329896
She was coming out of Marseilles harbor and was standing out to sea rapidly her sharp prow cleaving through the waves	392.7951469091631
Oh cried Edmond to think that in half an hour I could join her did I not fear being questioned detected and conveyed back to Marseilles What can I do What story can I invent under pretext of trading along the coast these men who are in reality smugglers will prefer selling me to doing a good action	284.82846707181517
In a few hours my strength will be utterly exhausted besides perhaps I have not been missed at the fortress	145.97156762747136
I can pass as one of the sailors wrecked last night	270.25740871881436
My story will be accepted for there is no one left to contradict me	75.7193532262441
As he spoke Dants looked toward the spot where the fishingvessel had been wrecked and started	115.93444324992912
The red cap of one of the sailors hung to a point of the rock and some timbers that had formed part of the vessels keel floated at the foot of the crag	137.31662441408085
In an instant Dants plan was formed	121.4842398416987
He swam to the cap placed it on his head seized one of the timbers and struck out so as to cut across the course the vessel was taking	94.69040458135756
And this conviction restored his strength	141.30074202281534
He soon saw that the vessel with the wind dead ahead was tacking between the Chteau dIf and the tower of Planier	328.4270691948259
For an instant he feared lest instead of keeping in shore she should stand out to sea but he soon saw that she would pass like most vessels bound for Italy between the islands of Jaros and Calaseraigne	258.80817407540866
However the vessel and the swimmer insensibly neared one another and in one of its tacks the tartan bore down within a quarter of a mile of him	351.08585055912914
He rose on the waves making signs of distress but no one on board saw him and the vessel stood on another tack	189.3640295932638
Dants would have shouted but he knew that the wind would drown his voice	67.19492469456814
It was then he rejoiced at his precaution in taking the timber for without it he would have been unable perhaps to reach the vesselcertainly to return to shore should he be unsuccessful in attracting attention	384.79526253464616
Dants though almost sure as to what course the vessel would take had yet watched it anxiously until it tacked and stood towards him	330.53086280753286
Then he advanced but before they could meet the vessel again changed her course	290.04180195434907
By a violent effort he rose half out of the water waving his cap and uttering a loud shout peculiar to sailors	176.5862929154182
This time he was both seen and heard and the tartan instantly steered towards him	336.2108795169919
At the same time he saw they were about to lower the boat	94.18090924838948
An instant after the boat rowed by two men advanced rapidly towards him	182.1501798418237
Dants let go of the timber which he now thought to be useless and swam vigorously to meet them	302.08296676282987
But he had reckoned too much upon his strength and then he realized how serviceable the timber had been to him	141.85368131328843
His arms became stiff his legs lost their flexibility and he was almost breathless	219.1876114273928
The two sailors redoubled their efforts and one of them cried in Italian Courage	250.55686955085545
The word reached his ear as a wave which he no longer had the strength to surmount passed over his head	87.04176181902564
He rose again to the surface struggled with the last desperate effort of a drowning man uttered a third cry and felt himself sinking as if the fatal cannon shot were again tied to his feet	210.6900589270324
The water passed over his head and the sky turned gray	98.00265152199455
A convulsive movement again brought him to the surface	55.514443278412145
He felt himself seized by the hair then he saw and heard nothing	49.593329414239136
When he opened his eyes Dants found himself on the deck of the tartan	127.22796347845474
His first care was to see what course they were taking	79.01753226895441
They were rapidly leaving the Chteau dIf behind	237.3435920170992
Dants was so exhausted that the exclamation of joy he uttered was mistaken for a sigh	77.83458458321002
As we have said he was lying on the deck	84.71487878102468
A sailor was rubbing his limbs with a woollen cloth another whom he recognized as the one who had cried out Courage held a gourd full of rum to his mouth while the third an old sailor at once the pilot and captain looked on with that egotistical pity men feel for a misfortune that they have escaped yesterday and which may overtake them tomorrow	237.7486748125556
A few drops of the rum restored suspended animation while the friction of his limbs restored their elasticity	1176.594391850332
Who are you said the pilot in bad French	1260.9488444125443
I am replied Dants in bad Italian a Maltese sailor	1347.4342507512679
We were coming from Syracuse laden with grain	2139.0750786283834
The storm of last night overtook us at Cape Morgiou and we were wrecked on these rocks	671.6031897697827
From these rocks that I had the good luck to cling to while our captain and the rest of the crew were all lost	119.65762594957104
I saw your vessel and fearful of being left to perish on the desolate island I swam off on a piece of wreckage to try and intercept your course	295.4157642576757
You have saved my life and I thank you continued Dants	94.35679688715206
I was lost when one of your sailors caught hold of my hair	340.27031994464653
It was I said a sailor of a frank and manly appearance and it was time for you were sinking	190.5102135124146
Yes returned Dants holding out his hand I thank you again	32.54482699859185
I almost hesitated though replied the sailor you looked more like a brigand than an honest man with your beard six inches and your hair a foot long	169.53607337459727
Dants recollected that his hair and beard had not been cut all the time he was at the Chteau dIf	45.033269457970704
Yes said he I made a vow to our Lady of the Grotto not to cut my hair or beard for ten years if I were saved in a moment of danger but today the vow expires	189.11147957257563
Now what are we to do with you said the captain	20.360841503731926
My captain is dead I have barely escaped but I am a good sailor	192.8292350086967
Leave me at the first port you make I shall be sure to find employment	149.5125082240313
I have sailed over it since my childhood	559.2519430603605
There are few ports that I could not enter or leave with a bandage over my eyes	105.49686676785119
I say captain said the sailor who had cried Courage to Dants if what he says is true what hinders his staying with us	370.92749380257044
If he says true said the captain doubtingly	1692.0057939361534
But in his present condition he will promise anything and take his chance of keeping it afterwards	277.8162212900802
I will do more than I promise said Dants	79.34901297786912
We shall see returned the other smiling	168.7591124816632
Where are you going asked Dants	1657.2616412212851
Then why instead of tacking so frequently do you not sail nearer the wind	173.89439900011263
Because we should run straight on to the Island of Rion	105.18560983842272
You shall pass it by twenty fathoms	6463.614116284601
Take the helm and let us see what you know	11.21584059516491
The young man took the helm felt to see if the vessel answered the rudder promptly and seeing that without being a firstrate sailor she yet was tolerably obedient	534.8094040970278
The four seamen who composed the crew obeyed while the pilot looked on	266.53023016731976
This order was also executed and the vessel passed as Dants had predicted twenty fathoms to windward	733.7496224064887
And they all looked with astonishment at this man whose eye now disclosed an intelligence and his body a vigor they had not thought him capable of showing	240.6097595599827
You see said Dants quitting the helm I shall be of some use to you at least during the voyage	112.94615167420035
If you do not want me at Leghorn you can leave me there and I will pay you out of the first wages I get for my food and the clothes you lend me	79.47669361674097
Ah said the captain we can agree very well if you are reasonable	81.85297100423806
Give me what you give the others and it will be all right returned Dants	102.4815423559057
That s not fair said the seaman who had saved Dants for you know more than we do	93.36149540283547
What is that to you Jacopo returned the Captain	1960.2437503814015
Everyone is free to ask what he pleases	195.6620552301403
That s true replied Jacopo I only make a remark	105.97975254431985
Well you would do much better to find him a jacket and a pair of trousers if you have them	78.90099126307597
No said Jacopo but I have a shirt and a pair of trousers	68.30708465475598
That is all I want interrupted Dants	5755.549988880873
Jacopo dived into the hold and soon returned with what Edmond wanted	197.96061369331835
Now then do you wish for anything else said the patron	54.737229217389164
A piece of bread and another glass of the capital rum I tasted for I have not eaten or drunk for a long time	113.78619930857263
He had not tasted food for forty hours	102.19523947774383
A piece of bread was brought and Jacopo offered him the gourd	321.27833903940234
Larboard your helm cried the captain to the steersman	271.77157125743094
Dants glanced that way as he lifted the gourd to his mouth then paused with hand in midair	269.4781525306764
Hollo what s the matter at the Chteau dIf said the captain	57.49436546520535
A small white cloud which had attracted Dants attention crowned the summit of the bastion of the Chteau dIf	146.71282528823687
At the same moment the faint report of a gun was heard	88.26032343023711
The sailors looked at one another	86.81922530699707
What is this asked the captain	183.90018523800674
A prisoner has escaped from the Chteau dIf and they are firing the alarm gun replied Dants	253.58661652031654
The captain glanced at him but he had lifted the rum to his lips and was drinking it with so much composure that suspicions if the captain had any died away	112.21978037506476
Pretty strong rum said Dants wiping his brow with his sleeve	33.591983156539584
At any rate murmured he if it be so much the better for I have made a rare acquisition	76.88514239526395
Under pretence of being fatigued Dants asked to take the helm the steersman glad to be relieved looked at the captain and the latter by a sign indicated that he might abandon it to his new comrade	157.36694642063688
Dants could thus keep his eyes on Marseilles	174.79565587368222
What is the day of the month asked he of Jacopo who sat down beside him	97.9168016082283
In what yearyou ask me in what year	284.0535027468963
Yes replied the young man I ask you in what year	76.75483987553538
I got such a fright last night replied Dants smiling that I have almost lost my memory	100.83250954083896
I ask you what year is it	29.47093411308457
It was fourteen years day for day since Dants arrest	238.8645247641512
He was nineteen when he entered the Chteau dIf he was thirtythree when he escaped	146.73415944563814
A sorrowful smile passed over his face he asked himself what had become of Mercds who must believe him dead	59.95238180498613
Then his eyes lighted up with hatred as he thought of the three men who had caused him so long and wretched a captivity	73.72897095716252
He renewed against Danglars Fernand and Villefort the oath of implacable vengeance he had made in his dungeon	119.08476845632973
This oath was no longer a vain menace for the fastest sailor in the Mediterranean would have been unable to overtake the little tartan that with every stitch of canvas set was flying before the wind to Leghorn	401.342671738806
Dants had not been a day on board before he had a very clear idea of the men with whom his lot had been cast	97.47140665067579
Without having been in the school of the Abb Faria the worthy master of La Jeune Amlie the name of the Genoese tartan knew a smattering of all the tongues spoken on the shores of that large lake called the Mediterranean from the Arabic to the Provenal and this while it spared him interpreters persons always troublesome and frequently indiscreet gave him great facilities of communication either with the vessels he met at sea with the small boats sailing along the coast or with the people without name country or occupation who are always seen on the quays of seaports and who live by hidden and mysterious means which we must suppose to be a direct gift of Providence as they have no visible means of support	241.57670626697976
It is fair to assume that Dants was on board a smuggler	169.79627074629425
At first the captain had received Dants on board with a certain degree of distrust	128.19865079817865
He was very well known to the customs officers of the coast and as there was between these worthies and himself a perpetual battle of wits he had at first thought that Dants might be an emissary of these industrious guardians of rights and duties who perhaps employed this ingenious means of learning some of the secrets of his trade	255.81350847386423
But the skilful manner in which Dants had handled the lugger had entirely reassured him and then when he saw the light plume of smoke floating above the bastion of the Chteau dIf and heard the distant report he was instantly struck with the idea that he had on board his vessel one whose coming and going like that of kings was accompanied with salutes of artillery	189.7227586675831
This made him less uneasy it must be owned than if the newcomer had proved to be a customs officer but this supposition also disappeared like the first when he beheld the perfect tranquillity of his recruit	224.01440529862256
Edmond thus had the advantage of knowing what the owner was without the owner knowing who he was and however the old sailor and his crew tried to pump him they extracted nothing more from him he gave accurate descriptions of Naples and Malta which he knew as well as Marseilles and held stoutly to his first story	246.34482247175256
Thus the Genoese subtle as he was was duped by Edmond in whose favor his mild demeanor his nautical skill and his admirable dissimulation pleaded	613.9394206873302
Moreover it is possible that the Genoese was one of those shrewd persons who know nothing but what they should know and believe nothing but what they should believe	110.55232492334073
In this state of mutual understanding they reached Leghorn	1716.0114617478584
Here Edmond was to undergo another trial he was to find out whether he could recognize himself as he had not seen his own face for fourteen years	56.70748331271427
He had preserved a tolerably good remembrance of what the youth had been and was now to find out what the man had become	108.87776594377814
His comrades believed that his vow was fulfilled	512.3554991619187
As he had twenty times touched at Leghorn he remembered a barber in St	413.52761593642344
Ferdinand Street he went there to have his beard and hair cut	329.44054926129456
The barber gazed in amazement at this man with the long thick and black hair and beard which gave his head the appearance of one of Titians portraits	71.51680645336067
At this period it was not the fashion to wear so large a beard and hair so long now a barber would only be surprised if a man gifted with such advantages should consent voluntarily to deprive himself of them	236.2455338847552
The Leghorn barber said nothing and went to work	67.94358505981928
When the operation was concluded and Edmond felt that his chin was completely smooth and his hair reduced to its usual length he asked for a lookingglass	168.30210606471653
He was now as we have said threeandthirty years of age and his fourteen years imprisonment had produced a great transformation in his appearance	141.21015195819746
Dants had entered the Chteau dIf with the round open smiling face of a young and happy man with whom the early paths of life have been smooth and who anticipates a future corresponding with his past	178.77904384517805
The oval face was lengthened his smiling mouth had assumed the firm and marked lines which betoken resolution his eyebrows were arched beneath a brow furrowed with thought his eyes were full of melancholy and from their depths occasionally sparkled gloomy fires of misanthropy and hatred his complexion so long kept from the sun had now that pale color which produces when the features are encircled with black hair the aristocratic beauty of the man of the north the profound learning he had acquired had besides diffused over his features a refined intellectual expression and he had also acquired being naturally of a goodly stature that vigor which a frame possesses which has so long concentrated all its force within itself	335.6525227048216
To the elegance of a nervous and slight form had succeeded the solidity of a rounded and muscular figure	341.27090489558356
As to his voice prayers sobs and imprecations had changed it so that at times it was of a singularly penetrating sweetness and at others rough and almost hoarse	423.38448994629255
Moreover from being so long in twilight or darkness his eyes had acquired the faculty of distinguishing objects in the night common to the hyena and the wolf	251.3163373766898
Edmond smiled when he beheld himself it was impossible that his best friendif indeed he had any friend leftcould recognize him he could not recognize himself	194.60430346581157
The master of La Jeune Amlie who was very desirous of retaining amongst his crew a man of Edmonds value had offered to advance him funds out of his future profits which Edmond had accepted	212.6105673113979
His next care on leaving the barbers who had achieved his first metamorphosis was to enter a shop and buy a complete sailors suita garb as we all know very simple and consisting of white trousers a striped shirt and a cap	398.41062661227204
It was in this costume and bringing back to Jacopo the shirt and trousers he had lent him that Edmond reappeared before the captain of the lugger who had made him tell his story over and over again before he could believe him or recognize in the neat and trim sailor the man with thick and matted beard hair tangled with seaweed and body soaking in seabrine whom he had picked up naked and nearly drowned	306.45006714986306
Attracted by his prepossessing appearance he renewed his offers of an engagement to Dants but Dants who had his own projects would not agree for a longer time than three months	115.17847545562977
La Jeune Amlie had a very active crew very obedient to their captain who lost as little time as possible	333.19615584661284
He had scarcely been a week at Leghorn before the hold of his vessel was filled with printed muslins contraband cottons English powder and tobacco on which the excise had forgotten to put its mark	469.8365280641963
The master was to get all this out of Leghorn free of duties and land it on the shores of Corsica where certain speculators undertook to forward the cargo to France	363.1389312988561
They sailed Edmond was again cleaving the azure sea which had been the first horizon of his youth and which he had so often dreamed of in prison	123.70260429235839
He left Gorgone on his right and La Pianosa on his left and went towards the country of Paoli and Napoleon	135.28474867274252
The next morning going on deck as he always did at an early hour the patron found Dants leaning against the bulwarks gazing with intense earnestness at a pile of granite rocks which the rising sun tinged with rosy light	276.3522553409831
It was the Island of Monte Cristo	1.2181504861800563
La Jeune Amlie left it threequarters of a league to the larboard and kept on for Corsica	308.8348299607439
Dants thought as they passed so closely to the island whose name was so interesting to him that he had only to leap into the sea and in half an hour be at the promised land	59.715906356962606
But then what could he do without instruments to discover his treasure without arms to defend himself Besides what would the sailors say What would the patron think He must wait	377.28047715228377
Fortunately Dants had learned how to wait he had waited fourteen years for his liberty and now he was free he could wait at least six months or a year for wealth	95.3186473357584
Would he not have accepted liberty without riches if it had been offered to him Besides were not those riches chimericaloffspring of the brain of the poor Abb Faria had they not died with him It is true the letter of the Cardinal Spada was singularly circumstantial and Dants repeated it to himself from one end to the other for he had not forgotten a word	134.66165506203018
Evening came and Edmond saw the island tinged with the shades of twilight and then disappear in the darkness from all eyes but his own for he with vision accustomed to the gloom of a prison continued to behold it last of all for he remained alone upon deck	176.22717912970725
The next morn broke off the coast of Aleria all day they coasted and in the evening saw fires lighted on land the position of these was no doubt a signal for landing for a ships lantern was hung up at the masthead instead of the streamer and they came to within a gunshot of the shore	284.02073784865115
Dants noticed that the captain of La Jeune Amlie had as he neared the land mounted two small culverins which without making much noise can throw a four ounce ball a thousand paces or so	466.6665420018306
But on this occasion the precaution was superfluous and everything proceeded with the utmost smoothness and politeness	359.29783459058575
Four shallops came off with very little noise alongside the lugger which no doubt in acknowledgement of the compliment lowered her own shallop into the sea and the five boats worked so well that by two oclock in the morning all the cargo was out of La Jeune Amlie and on terra firma	188.04050625823456
The same night such a man of regularity was the patron of La Jeune Amlie the profits were divided and each man had a hundred Tuscan livres or about eighty francs	181.76210168082588
But the voyage was not ended	3612.729213521521
They turned the bowsprit towards Sardinia where they intended to take in a cargo which was to replace what had been discharged	154.46195797874546
The second operation was as successful as the first La Jeune Amlie was in luck	239.00054949437134
This new cargo was destined for the coast of the Duchy of Lucca and consisted almost entirely of Havana cigars sherry and Malaga wines	621.6923020352792
There they had a bit of a skirmish in getting rid of the duties the excise was in truth the everlasting enemy of the patron of La Jeune Amlie	211.1265220192057
A customs officer was laid low and two sailors wounded Dants was one of the latter a ball having touched him in the left shoulder	136.65121145430038
Dants was almost glad of this affray and almost pleased at being wounded for they were rude lessons which taught him with what eye he could view danger and with what endurance he could bear suffering	434.57993333802153
He had contemplated danger with a smile and when wounded had exclaimed with the great philosopher Pain thou art not an evil	390.16446595393734
He had moreover looked upon the customs officer wounded to death and whether from heat of blood produced by the encounter or the chill of human sentiment this sight had made but slight impression upon him	276.44178116672356
Dants was on the way he desired to follow and was moving towards the end he wished to achieve his heart was in a fair way of petrifying in his bosom	111.74448325685863
Jacopo seeing him fall had believed him killed and rushing towards him raised him up and then attended to him with all the kindness of a devoted comrade	98.46978535685211
This world was not then so good as Doctor Pangloss believed it neither was it so wicked as Dants thought it since this man who had nothing to expect from his comrade but the inheritance of his share of the prizemoney manifested so much sorrow when he saw him fall	160.53984150230565
Fortunately as we have said Edmond was only wounded and with certain herbs gathered at certain seasons and sold to the smugglers by the old Sardinian women the wound soon closed	612.1687419714112
Edmond then resolved to try Jacopo and offered him in return for his attention a share of his prizemoney but Jacopo refused it indignantly	356.39899655155347
As a result of the sympathetic devotion which Jacopo had from the first bestowed on Edmond the latter was moved to a certain degree of affection	226.43948213220114
But this sufficed for Jacopo who instinctively felt that Edmond had a right to superiority of positiona superiority which Edmond had concealed from all others	327.0987311333778
And from this time the kindness which Edmond showed him was enough for the brave seaman	505.8258892658206
Then in the long days on board ship when the vessel gliding on with security over the azure sea required no care but the hand of the helmsman thanks to the favorable winds that swelled her sails Edmond with a chart in his hand became the instructor of Jacopo as the poor Abb Faria had been his tutor	297.4174742072178
He pointed out to him the bearings of the coast explained to him the variations of the compass and taught him to read in that vast book opened over our heads which they call heaven and where God writes in azure with letters of diamonds	228.247264811986
And when Jacopo inquired of him What is the use of teaching all these things to a poor sailor like me Edmond replied Who knows You may one day be the captain of a vessel	158.924319367078
We had forgotten to say that Jacopo was a Corsican	199.89486484231216
Two months and a half elapsed in these trips and Edmond had become as skilful a coaster as he had been a hardy seaman he had formed an acquaintance with all the smugglers on the coast and learned all the Masonic signs by which these half pirates recognize each other	324.10989383267224
He had passed and repassed his Island of Monte Cristo twenty times but not once had he found an opportunity of landing there	140.28399615470408
As soon as his engagement with the patron of La Jeune Amlie ended he would hire a small vessel on his own accountfor in his several voyages he had amassed a hundred piastresand under some pretext land at the Island of Monte Cristo	226.906455888143
Then he would be free to make his researches not perhaps entirely at liberty for he would be doubtless watched by those who accompanied him	105.71959560807078
But in this world we must risk something	431.3685710467878
Prison had made Edmond prudent and he was desirous of running no risk whatever	154.07043610103995
But in vain did he rack his imagination fertile as it was he could not devise any plan for reaching the island without companionship	348.8581433409846
Dants was tossed about on these doubts and wishes when the patron who had great confidence in him and was very desirous of retaining him in his service took him by the arm one evening and led him to a tavern on the Via del Oglio where the leading smugglers of Leghorn used to congregate and discuss affairs connected with their trade	207.92093740826218
Already Dants had visited this maritime Bourse two or three times and seeing all these hardy freetraders who supplied the whole coast for nearly two hundred leagues in extent he had asked himself what power might not that man attain who should give the impulse of his will to all these contrary and diverging minds	309.8784322288967
This time it was a great matter that was under discussion connected with a vessel laden with Turkey carpets stuffs of the Levant and cashmeres	540.9593159717192
It was necessary to find some neutral ground on which an exchange could be made and then to try and land these goods on the coast of France	207.6290271514768
If the venture was successful the profit would be enormous there would be a gain of fifty or sixty piastres each for the crew	247.24995076295892
The patron of La Jeune Amlie proposed as a place of landing the Island of Monte Cristo which being completely deserted and having neither soldiers nor revenue officers seemed to have been placed in the midst of the ocean since the time of the heathen Olympus by Mercury the god of merchants and robbers classes of mankind which we in modern times have separated if not made distinct but which antiquity appears to have included in the same category	252.21112963736917
At the mention of Monte Cristo Dants started with joy he rose to conceal his emotion and took a turn around the smoky tavern where all the languages of the known world were jumbled in a lingua franca	177.35407431944776
When he again joined the two persons who had been discussing the matter it had been decided that they should touch at Monte Cristo and set out on the following night	53.411244572325195
Edmond being consulted was of opinion that the island afforded every possible security and that great enterprises to be well done should be done quickly	396.25771045874916
Nothing then was altered in the plan and orders were given to get under weigh next night and wind and weather permitting to make the neutral island by the following day	374.68910532059834
Thus at length by one of the unexpected strokes of fortune which sometimes befall those who have for a long time been the victims of an evil destiny Dants was about to secure the opportunity he wished for by simple and natural means and land on the island without incurring any suspicion	161.4682703120198
One night more and he would be on his way	28.094551927661524
The night was one of feverish distraction and in its progress visions good and evil passed through Dants mind	859.1286092691025
If he closed his eyes he saw Cardinal Spadas letter written on the wall in characters of flameif he slept for a moment the wildest dreams haunted his brain	442.37699577444596
He ascended into grottos paved with emeralds with panels of rubies and the roof glowing with diamond stalactites	556.0061323397956
Pearls fell drop by drop as subterranean waters filter in their caves	2044.7483719408342
Edmond amazed wonderstruck filled his pockets with the radiant gems and then returned to daylight when he discovered that his prizes had all changed into common pebbles	351.09046001029054
He then endeavored to reenter the marvellous grottos but they had suddenly receded and now the path became a labyrinth and then the entrance vanished and in vain did he tax his memory for the magic and mysterious word which opened the splendid caverns of Ali Baba to the Arabian fisherman	261.0048655186131
All was useless the treasure disappeared and had again reverted to the genii from whom for a moment he had hoped to carry it off	99.689651942966
The day came at length and was almost as feverish as the night had been but it brought reason to the aid of imagination and Dants was then enabled to arrange a plan which had hitherto been vague and unsettled in his brain	132.14717074003684
Night came and with it the preparation for departure and these preparations served to conceal Dants agitation	666.2063456828455
He had by degrees assumed such authority over his companions that he was almost like a commander on board and as his orders were always clear distinct and easy of execution his comrades obeyed him with celerity and pleasure	260.31341181363246
The old patron did not interfere for he too had recognized the superiority of Dants over the crew and himself	226.03406936914027
He saw in the young man his natural successor and regretted that he had not a daughter that he might have bound Edmond to him by a more secure alliance	162.428388250542
At seven oclock in the evening all was ready and at ten minutes past seven they doubled the lighthouse just as the beacon was kindled	253.50478837025025
The sea was calm and with a fresh breeze from the southeast they sailed beneath a bright blue sky in which God also lighted up in turn his beacon lights each of which is a world	300.46523135397837
Dants told them that all hands might turn in and he would take the helm	233.0692947276465
When the Maltese for so they called Dants had said this it was sufficient and all went to their bunks contentedly	373.3716276561348
Dants cast from solitude into the world frequently experienced an imperious desire for solitude and what solitude is more complete or more poetical than that of a ship floating in isolation on the sea during the obscurity of the night in the silence of immensity and under the eye of Heaven	134.76916472400362
Now this solitude was peopled with his thoughts the night lighted up by his illusions and the silence animated by his anticipations	172.5334882490279
When the patron awoke the vessel was hurrying on with every sail set and every sail full with the breeze	428.6246714989402
They were making nearly ten knots an hour	212.56244062080253
The Island of Monte Cristo loomed large in the horizon	958.2875149157102
Edmond resigned the lugger to the masters care and went and lay down in his hammock but in spite of a sleepless night he could not close his eyes for a moment	73.89601336838868
Two hours afterwards he came on deck as the boat was about to double the Island of Elba	59.74009474536024
They were just abreast of Mareciana and beyond the flat but verdant Island of La Pianosa	1059.9594103000513
The peak of Monte Cristo reddened by the burning sun was seen against the azure sky	102.22470748882206
Dants ordered the helmsman to put down his helm in order to leave La Pianosa to starboard as he knew that he should shorten his course by two or three knots	148.01210948496797
About five oclock in the evening the island was distinct and everything on it was plainly perceptible owing to that clearness of the atmosphere peculiar to the light which the rays of the sun cast at its setting	179.63615536248884
Edmond gazed very earnestly at the mass of rocks which gave out all the variety of twilight colors from the brightest pink to the deepest blue and from time to time his cheeks flushed his brow darkened and a mist passed over his eyes	132.40737418010474
Never did a gamester whose whole fortune is staked on one cast of the die experience the anguish which Edmond felt in his paroxysms of hope	289.68503729063144
Night came and at ten oclock they anchored	501.74645635760805
La Jeune Amlie was first at the rendezvous	133.3012047705554
In spite of his usual command over himself Dants could not restrain his impetuosity	294.38231183823706
He was the first to jump on shore and had he dared he would like Lucius Brutus have kissed his mother earth	542.6158358085002
It was dark but at eleven oclock the moon rose in the midst of the ocean whose every wave she silvered and then ascending high played in floods of pale light on the rocky hills of this second Pelion	305.7680832492881
The island was familiar to the crew of La Jeune Amlieit was one of her regular haunts	268.01061935252994
As to Dants he had passed it on his voyage to and from the Levant but never touched at it	179.1218498652386
Where shall we pass the night he inquired	84.4794926599132
Why on board the tartan replied the sailor	611.8433765980757
Should we not do better in the grottos	299.07747909659196
Why the grottoscaves of the island	2835.1850294826977
I do not know of any grottos replied Jacopo	4222.612375784148
The cold sweat sprang forth on Dants brow	104.16810910885326
What are there no grottos at Monte Cristo he asked	55.28995228429935
For a moment Dants was speechless then he remembered that these caves might have been filled up by some accident or even stopped up for the sake of greater security by Cardinal Spada	188.40252440151124
The point was then to discover the hidden entrance	278.0324711466248
It was useless to search at night and Dants therefore delayed all investigation until the morning	486.3011447569466
Besides a signal made half a league out at sea and to which La Jeune Amlie replied by a similar signal indicated that the moment for business had come	113.9643227755018
The boat that now arrived assured by the answering signal that all was well soon came in sight white and silent as a phantom and cast anchor within a cables length of shore	328.6848896611097
Dants reflected as he worked on the shout of joy which with a single word he could evoke from all these men if he gave utterance to the one unchanging thought that pervaded his heart but far from disclosing this precious secret he almost feared that he had already said too much and by his restlessness and continual questions his minute observations and evident preoccupation aroused suspicions	308.15989336804864
Fortunately as regarded this circumstance at least his painful past gave to his countenance an indelible sadness and the glimmerings of gayety seen beneath this cloud were indeed but transitory	561.4765558975962
No one had the slightest suspicion and when next day taking a fowlingpiece powder and shot Dants declared his intention to go and kill some of the wild goats that were seen springing from rock to rock his wish was construed into a love of sport or a desire for solitude	357.4713466824014
However Jacopo insisted on following him and Dants did not oppose this fearing if he did so that he might incur distrust	123.47820608627252
Scarcely however had they gone a quarter of a league when having killed a kid he begged Jacopo to take it to his comrades and request them to cook it and when ready to let him know by firing a gun	160.73007517159886
This and some dried fruits and a flask of Monte Pulciano was the bill of fare	340.98118662709606
Dants went on looking from time to time behind and around about him	132.32055023511091
Having reached the summit of a rock he saw a thousand feet beneath him his companions whom Jacopo had rejoined and who were all busy preparing the repast which Edmonds skill as a marksman had augmented with a capital dish	315.662946863873
Edmond looked at them for a moment with the sad and gentle smile of a man superior to his fellows	46.792340277819235
In two hours time said he these persons will depart richer by fifty piastres each to go and risk their lives again by endeavoring to gain fifty more then they will return with a fortune of six hundred francs and waste this treasure in some city with the pride of sultans and the insolence of nabobs	206.2330188845121
At this moment hope makes me despise their riches which seem to me contemptible	320.3201904361918
Yet perchance tomorrow deception will so act on me that I shall on compulsion consider such a contemptible possession as the utmost happiness	379.73642640543153
Oh no exclaimed Edmond that will not be	16.551124129109414
The wise unerring Faria could not be mistaken in this one thing	36.24080682905417
Besides it were better to die than to continue to lead this low and wretched life	167.30168900815673
Thus Dants who but three months before had no desire but liberty had now not liberty enough and panted for wealth	280.5589429754059
The cause was not in Dants but in Providence who while limiting the power of man has filled him with boundless desires	357.70230500642884
Meanwhile by a cleft between two walls of rock following a path worn by a torrent and which in all human probability human foot had never before trod Dants approached the spot where he supposed the grottos must have existed	304.16586436519685
Keeping along the shore and examining the smallest object with serious attention he thought he could trace on certain rocks marks made by the hand of man	318.6095927767997
Time which encrusts all physical substances with its mossy mantle as it invests all things of the mind with forgetfulness seemed to have respected these signs which apparently had been made with some degree of regularity and probably with a definite purpose	257.0805963539593
Occasionally the marks were hidden under tufts of myrtle which spread into large bushes laden with blossoms or beneath parasitical lichen	1220.3262496441366
So Edmond had to separate the branches or brush away the moss to know where the guidemarks were	409.57513974744745
The sight of marks renewed Edmond fondest hopes	7982.514304607436
Might it not have been the cardinal himself who had first traced them in order that they might serve as a guide for his nephew in the event of a catastrophe which he could not foresee would have been so complete	91.48354193971169
This solitary place was precisely suited to the requirements of a man desirous of burying treasure	186.94247712043503
Only might not these betraying marks have attracted other eyes than those for whom they were made and had the dark and wondrous island indeed faithfully guarded its precious secret	606.0268636237365
It seemed however to Edmond who was hidden from his comrades by the inequalities of the ground that at sixty paces from the harbor the marks ceased nor did they terminate at any grotto	177.8161333322867
A large round rock placed solidly on its base was the only spot to which they seemed to lead	80.38920283962008
Edmond concluded that perhaps instead of having reached the end of the route he had only explored its beginning and he therefore turned round and retraced his steps	130.46756943240098
Meanwhile his comrades had prepared the repast had got some water from a spring spread out the fruit and bread and cooked the kid	268.1406973973635
Just at the moment when they were taking the dainty animal from the spit they saw Edmond springing with the boldness of a chamois from rock to rock and they fired the signal agreed upon	273.52128453167546
The sportsman instantly changed his direction and ran quickly towards them	277.70141843984595
But even while they watched his daring progress Edmonds foot slipped and they saw him stagger on the edge of a rock and disappear	272.6887398860563
They all rushed towards him for all loved Edmond in spite of his superiority yet Jacopo reached him first	267.8417493447041
He found Edmond lying prone bleeding and almost senseless	681.6280702613288
He had rolled down a declivity of twelve or fifteen feet	167.51962443244938
They poured a little rum down his throat and this remedy which had before been so beneficial to him produced the same effect as formerly	125.46739508062429
Edmond opened his eyes complained of great pain in his knee a feeling of heaviness in his head and severe pains in his loins	252.75428038842546
They wished to carry him to the shore but when they touched him although under Jacopos directions he declared with heavy groans that he could not bear to be moved	184.59634197666867
It may be supposed that Dants did not now think of his dinner but he insisted that his comrades who had not his reasons for fasting should have their meal	180.46892853658184
As for himself he declared that he had only need of a little rest and that when they returned he should be easier	82.84001557365613
The sailors did not require much urging	3460.678647714556
They were hungry and the smell of the roasted kid was very savory and your tars are not very ceremonious	411.34896869106404
All that Edmond had been able to do was to drag himself about a dozen paces forward to lean against a mossgrown rock	172.20402973813225
But instead of growing easier Dants pains appeared to increase in violence	1886.1830077217671
The old patron who was obliged to sail in the morning in order to land his cargo on the frontiers of Piedmont and France between Nice and Frjus urged Dants to try and rise	243.32340965728494
Edmond made great exertions in order to comply but at each effort he fell back moaning and turning pale	179.40035350064954
He has broken his ribs said the commander in a low voice	22.577943174377783
No matter he is an excellent fellow and we must not leave him	32.57863011278955
We will try and carry him on board the tartan	153.4118982653995
Dants declared however that he would rather die where he was than undergo the agony which the slightest movement cost him	228.46016306808593
Well said the patron let what may happen it shall never be said that we deserted a good comrade like you	151.78332809165823
We will not go till evening	725.4135632476613
This very much astonished the sailors although not one opposed it	684.4085778507879
The patron was so strict that this was the first time they had ever seen him give up an enterprise or even delay in its execution	58.16469386288709
Dants would not allow that any such infraction of regular and proper rules should be made in his favor	306.0702547452445
No no he said to the patron I was awkward and it is just that I pay the penalty of my clumsiness	147.5456227004795
Leave me a small supply of biscuit a gun powder and balls to kill the kids or defend myself at need and a pickaxe that I may build a shelter if you delay in coming back for me	341.8398823586613
But you ll die of hunger said the patron	35.8249487764467
I would rather do so was Edmonds reply than suffer the inexpressible agonies which the slightest movement causes me	895.2132008404277
The patron turned towards his vessel which was rolling on the swell in the little harbor and with sails partly set would be ready for sea when her toilet should be completed	271.95720172774077
What are we to do Maltese asked the captain	500.3269512274981
We can not leave you here so and yet we can not stay	79.68889865374544
We shall be absent at least a week said the patron and then we must run out of our course to come here and take you up again	62.66372257732952
Why said Dants if in two or three days you hail any fishingboat desire them to come here to me	223.95182881042535
I will pay twentyfive piastres for my passage back to Leghorn	316.2483432695745
If you do not come across one return for me	473.6223438310215
Listen Captain Baldi there s one way of settling this said Jacopo	387.7624597239314
Do you go and I will stay and take care of the wounded man	30.26161687739869
And give up your share of the venture said Edmond to remain with me	210.7265400975074
Yes said Jacopo and without any hesitation	242.51217427365728
You are a good fellow and a kindhearted messmate replied Edmond and heaven will recompense you for your generous intentions but I do not wish anyone to stay with me	157.5179361957675
A day or two of rest will set me up and I hope I shall find among the rocks certain herbs most excellent for bruises	315.29664889512395
A peculiar smile passed over Dants lips he squeezed Jacopos hand warmly but nothing could shake his determination to remainand remain alone	1020.8289715914007
The smugglers left with Edmond what he had requested and set sail but not without turning about several times and each time making signs of a cordial farewell to which Edmond replied with his hand only as if he could not move the rest of his body	122.1537213334593
Then when they had disappeared he said with a smileTis strange that it should be among such men that we find proofs of friendship and devotion	148.53292058915798
Then he dragged himself cautiously to the top of a rock from which he had a full view of the sea and thence he saw the tartan complete her preparations for sailing weigh anchor and balancing herself as gracefully as a waterfowl ere it takes to the wing set sail	282.4556668938133
At the end of an hour she was completely out of sight at least it was impossible for the wounded man to see her any longer from the spot where he was	33.1658112455834
Then Dants rose more agile and light than the kid among the myrtles and shrubs of these wild rocks took his gun in one hand his pickaxe in the other and hastened towards the rock on which the marks he had noted terminated	168.54015314984943
And now he exclaimed remembering the tale of the Arabian fisherman which Faria had related to him now Open Sesame	317.74692370234
The sun had nearly reached the meridian and his scorching rays fell full on the rocks which seemed themselves sensible of the heat	239.99752075483377
Thousands of grasshoppers hidden in the bushes chirped with a monotonous and dull note the leaves of the myrtle and olive trees waved and rustled in the wind	314.93770631894665
At every step that Edmond took he disturbed the lizards glittering with the hues of the emerald afar off he saw the wild goats bounding from crag to crag	482.82361038960266
In a word the island was inhabited yet Edmond felt himself alone guided by the hand of God	168.09516407250084
He felt an indescribable sensation somewhat akin to dreadthat dread of the daylight which even in the desert makes us fear we are watched and observed	412.81477528478973
This feeling was so strong that at the moment when Edmond was about to begin his labor he stopped laid down his pickaxe seized his gun mounted to the summit of the highest rock and from thence gazed round in every direction	100.44937758407242
But it was not upon Corsica the very houses of which he could distinguish or on Sardinia or on the Island of Elba with its historical associations or upon the almost imperceptible line that to the experienced eye of a sailor alone revealed the coast of Genoa the proud and Leghorn the commercial that he gazed	294.3506264469073
It was at the brigantine that had left in the morning and the tartan that had just set sail that Edmond fixed his eyes	72.68500484771941
The first was just disappearing in the straits of Bonifacio the other following an opposite direction was about to round the Island of Corsica	247.92533746838703
He then looked at the objects near him	888.6687784287667
He saw that he was on the highest point of the islanda statue on this vast pedestal of granite nothing human appearing in sight while the blue ocean beat against the base of the island and covered it with a fringe of foam	217.03886433792897
Then he descended with cautious and slow step for he dreaded lest an accident similar to that he had so adroitly feigned should happen in reality	376.8783529444863
Dants as we have said had traced the marks along the rocks and he had noticed that they led to a small creek which was hidden like the bath of some ancient nymph	170.61230344223515
This creek was sufficiently wide at its mouth and deep in the centre to admit of the entrance of a small vessel of the lugger class which would be perfectly concealed from observation	130.9770606692541
Then following the clew that in the hands of the Abb Faria had been so skilfully used to guide him through the Ddalian labyrinth of probabilities he thought that the Cardinal Spada anxious not to be watched had entered the creek concealed his little barque followed the line marked by the notches in the rock and at the end of it had buried his treasure	151.2980831182051
It was this idea that had brought Dants back to the circular rock	322.78270503571343
One thing only perplexed Edmond and destroyed his theory	543.5555682085396
How could this rock which weighed several tons have been lifted to this spot without the aid of many men	270.8415912313859
Suddenly an idea flashed across his mind	51.15329204287571
Instead of raising it thought he they have lowered it	139.8132852389407
And he sprang from the rock in order to inspect the base on which it had formerly stood	181.91110336989738
He soon perceived that a slope had been formed and the rock had slid along this until it stopped at the spot it now occupied	215.31827983890074
A large stone had served as a wedge flints and pebbles had been inserted around it so as to conceal the orifice this species of masonry had been covered with earth and grass and weeds had grown there moss had clung to the stones myrtlebushes had taken root and the old rock seemed fixed to the earth	284.5047271504826
Dants dug away the earth carefully and detected or fancied he detected the ingenious artifice	1534.757731051195
He attacked this wall cemented by the hand of time with his pickaxe	87.7102980578632
After ten minutes labor the wall gave way and a hole large enough to insert the arm was opened	211.52831549611435
Dants went and cut the strongest olivetree he could find stripped off its branches inserted it in the hole and used it as a lever	378.4093627185534
But the rock was too heavy and too firmly wedged to be moved by anyone man were he Hercules himself	443.420600702541
Dants saw that he must attack the wedge	2491.7066001192757
He cast his eyes around and saw the horn full of powder which his friend Jacopo had left him	99.19665220161016
He smiled the infernal invention would serve him for this purpose	93.37934064256625
With the aid of his pickaxe Dants after the manner of a laborsaving pioneer dug a mine between the upper rock and the one that supported it filled it with powder then made a match by rolling his handkerchief in saltpetre	341.7610482444405
The explosion soon followed the upper rock was lifted from its base by the terrific force of the powder the lower one flew into pieces thousands of insects escaped from the aperture Dants had previously formed and a huge snake like the guardian demon of the treasure rolled himself along in darkening coils and disappeared	363.20016899553826
Dants approached the upper rock which now without any support leaned towards the sea	272.99861220669925
The intrepid treasureseeker walked round it and selecting the spot from whence it appeared most susceptible to attack placed his lever in one of the crevices and strained every nerve to move the mass	277.589456753496
The rock already shaken by the explosion tottered on its base	260.46126209334614
Dants redoubled his efforts he seemed like one of the ancient Titans who uprooted the mountains to hurl against the father of the gods	230.50438819911975
The rock yielded rolled over bounded from point to point and finally disappeared in the ocean	236.69986636175398
On the spot it had occupied was a circular space exposing an iron ring let into a square flagstone	900.1863804740942
Dants uttered a cry of joy and surprise never had a first attempt been crowned with more perfect success	153.64799628503093
He would fain have continued but his knees trembled and his heart beat so violently and his sight became so dim that he was forced to pause	70.11408843387969
This feeling lasted but for a moment	4.578126645317543
Edmond inserted his lever in the ring and exerted all his strength the flagstone yielded and disclosed steps that descended until they were lost in the obscurity of a subterraneous grotto	260.4665295980468
Anyone else would have rushed on with a cry of joy	22.368316854895863
Dants turned pale hesitated and reflected	956.4562008738634
Come said he to himself be a man	182.40103504770627
I must not be cast down by the discovery that I have been deceived	29.418822746964583
What then would be the use of all I have suffered The heart breaks when after having been elated by flattering hopes it sees all its illusions destroyed	258.6554306674808
Faria has dreamed this the Cardinal Spada buried no treasure here perhaps he never came here or if he did Csar Borgia the intrepid adventurer the stealthy and indefatigable plunderer has followed him discovered his traces pursued them as I have done raised the stone and descending before me has left me nothing	426.84877917451223
He remained motionless and pensive his eyes fixed on the gloomy aperture that was open at his feet	40.43607404190745
Now that I expect nothing now that I no longer entertain the slightest hopes the end of this adventure becomes simply a matter of curiosity	224.52793120541747
And he remained again motionless and thoughtful	121.06984921273876
Yes yes this is an adventure worthy a place in the varied career of that royal bandit	288.01632532165434
This fabulous event formed but a link in a long chain of marvels	288.21702437824206
Yes Borgia has been here a torch in one hand a sword in the other and within twenty paces at the foot of this rock perhaps two guards kept watch on land and sea while their master descended as I am about to descend dispelling the darkness before his aweinspiring progress	179.7545112781154
But what was the fate of the guards who thus possessed his secret asked Dants of himself	129.1656067081269
The fate replied he smiling of those who buried Alaric and were interred with the corpse	258.87879641475763
Yet had he come thought Dants he would have found the treasure and Borgia he who compared Italy to an artichoke which he could devour leaf by leaf knew too well the value of time to waste it in replacing this rock	429.19459930142284
Then he descended a smile on his lips and murmuring that last word of human philosophy Perhaps	251.60153717041555
But instead of the darkness and the thick and mephitic atmosphere he had expected to find Dants saw a dim and bluish light which as well as the air entered not merely by the aperture he had just formed but by the interstices and crevices of the rock which were visible from without and through which he could distinguish the blue sky and the waving branches of the evergreen oaks and the tendrils of the creepers that grew from the rocks	144.44955746628077
After having stood a few minutes in the cavern the atmosphere of which was rather warm than damp Dants eye habituated as it was to darkness could pierce even to the remotest angles of the cavern which was of granite that sparkled like diamonds	236.30658013729322
Alas said Edmond smiling these are the treasures the cardinal has left and the good abb seeing in a dream these glittering walls has indulged in fallacious hopes	385.16200719077625
But he called to mind the words of the will which he knew by heart	85.49891493107447
In the farthest angle of the second opening said the cardinals will	290.3585601238179
He had only found the first grotto he had now to seek the second	166.8629954054178
He reflected that this second grotto must penetrate deeper into the island he examined the stones and sounded one part of the wall where he fancied the opening existed masked for precautions sake	342.16966605559605
The pickaxe struck for a moment with a dull sound that drew out of Dants forehead large drops of perspiration	116.89760751079214
At last it seemed to him that one part of the wall gave forth a more hollow and deeper echo he eagerly advanced and with the quickness of perception that no one but a prisoner possesses saw that there in all probability the opening must be	171.26669267074686
However he like Csar Borgia knew the value of time and in order to avoid fruitless toil he sounded all the other walls with his pickaxe struck the earth with the butt of his gun and finding nothing that appeared suspicious returned to that part of the wall whence issued the consoling sound he had before heard	180.26423901293649
He again struck it and with greater force	200.59774582181672
As he struck the wall pieces of stucco similar to that used in the ground work of arabesques broke off and fell to the ground in flakes exposing a large white stone	219.5991256806405
The aperture of the rock had been closed with stones then this stucco had been applied and painted to imitate granite	448.0000014535871
Dants struck with the sharp end of his pickaxe which entered someway between the interstices	522.8850201988623
It was there he must dig	10374.820769306858
But by some strange play of emotion in proportion as the proofs that Faria had not been deceived became stronger so did his heart give way and a feeling of discouragement stole over him	313.981259008118
This last proof instead of giving him fresh strength deprived him of it the pickaxe descended or rather fell he placed it on the ground passed his hand over his brow and remounted the stairs alleging to himself as an excuse a desire to be assured that no one was watching him but in reality because he felt that he was about to faint	96.10442634455116
The island was deserted and the sun seemed to cover it with its fiery glance afar off a few small fishing boats studded the bosom of the blue ocean	255.03135406652828
Dants had tasted nothing but he thought not of hunger at such a moment he hastily swallowed a few drops of rum and again entered the cavern	89.92357498817552
The pickaxe that had seemed so heavy was now like a feather in his grasp he seized it and attacked the wall	117.05400298698912
After several blows he perceived that the stones were not cemented but had been merely placed one upon the other and covered with stucco he inserted the point of his pickaxe and using the handle as a lever with joy soon saw the stone turn as if on hinges and fall at his feet	201.33166127936224
He had nothing more to do now but with the iron tooth of the pickaxe to draw the stones towards him one by one	209.323935168335
The aperture was already sufficiently large for him to enter but by waiting he could still cling to hope and retard the certainty of deception	248.6168576938379
At last after renewed hesitation Dants entered the second grotto	380.46833706704365
The second grotto was lower and more gloomy than the first the air that could only enter by the newly formed opening had the mephitic smell Dants was surprised not to find in the outer cavern	187.39594664317303
He waited in order to allow pure air to displace the foul atmosphere and then went on	622.1861972205623
At the left of the opening was a dark and deep angle	244.62336842369982
But to Dants eye there was no darkness	31.33948788193268
He glanced around this second grotto it was like the first empty	146.90977768645195
The treasure if it existed was buried in this corner	61.99571249924383
The time had at length arrived two feet of earth removed and Dants fate would be decided	296.63972444670196
He advanced towards the angle and summoning all his resolution attacked the ground with the pickaxe	258.7488883984527
At the fifth or sixth blow the pickaxe struck against an iron substance	378.96051625268524
Never did funeral knell never did alarmbell produce a greater effect on the hearer	488.685160842471
Had Dants found nothing he could not have become more ghastly pale	130.04329972258415
He again struck his pickaxe into the earth and encountered the same resistance but not the same sound	57.35707126138066
It is a casket of wood bound with iron thought he	426.26278217286443
At this moment a shadow passed rapidly before the opening Dants seized his gun sprang through the opening and mounted the stair	145.394181904625
A wild goat had passed before the mouth of the cave and was feeding at a little distance	52.92574359422346
This would have been a favorable occasion to secure his dinner but Dants feared lest the report of his gun should attract attention	356.6025816534659
He thought a moment cut a branch of a resinous tree lighted it at the fire at which the smugglers had prepared their breakfast and descended with this torch	202.80950149430083
He approached the hole he had dug and now with the aid of the torch saw that his pickaxe had in reality struck against iron and wood	236.38488307221314
He planted his torch in the ground and resumed his labor	117.49335050899707
In an instant a space three feet long by two feet broad was cleared and Dants could see an oaken coffer bound with cut steel in the middle of the lid he saw engraved on a silver plate which was still untarnished the arms of the Spada familyviz	172.50593613278704
a sword en pale on an oval shield like all the Italian armorial bearings and surmounted by a cardinals hat	379.9848389148381
Dants easily recognized them Faria had so often drawn them for him	49.7493360943022
There was no longer any doubt the treasure was thereno one would have been at such pains to conceal an empty casket	229.9462649192053
In an instant he had cleared every obstacle away and he saw successively the lock placed between two padlocks and the two handles at each end all carved as things were carved at that epoch when art rendered the commonest metals precious	643.3011870509137
Dants seized the handles and strove to lift the coffer it was impossible	147.9301991135404
He sought to open it lock and padlock were fastened these faithful guardians seemed unwilling to surrender their trust	1675.867492739108
Dants inserted the sharp end of the pickaxe between the coffer and the lid and pressing with all his force on the handle burst open the fastenings	139.22463328932005
The hinges yielded in their turn and fell still holding in their grasp fragments of the wood and the chest was open	123.62137905948482
Edmond was seized with vertigo he cocked his gun and laid it beside him	159.33518415326304
He then closed his eyes as children do in order that they may see in the resplendent night of their own imagination more stars than are visible in the firmament then he reopened them and stood motionless with amazement	218.7247915272843
In the first blazed piles of golden coin in the second were ranged bars of unpolished gold which possessed nothing attractive save their value in the third Edmond grasped handfuls of diamonds pearls and rubies which as they fell on one another sounded like hail against glass	514.8033497175663
After having touched felt examined these treasures Edmond rushed through the caverns like a man seized with frenzy he leaped on a rock from whence he could behold the sea	218.6690578197713
He was alonealone with these countless these unheardof treasures Was he awake or was it but a dream Was it a transient vision or was he face to face with reality	662.2831714795155
He would fain have gazed upon his gold and yet he had not strength enough for an instant he leaned his head in his hands as if to prevent his senses from leaving him and then rushed madly about the rocks of Monte Cristo terrifying the wild goats and scaring the seafowls with his wild cries and gestures then he returned and still unable to believe the evidence of his senses rushed into the grotto and found himself before this mine of gold and jewels	86.91481876177123
This time he fell on his knees and clasping his hands convulsively uttered a prayer intelligible to God alone	70.10361049429376
He soon became calmer and more happy for only now did he begin to realize his felicity	251.39477129446232
He then set himself to work to count his fortune	172.99205826903645
There were a thousand ingots of gold each weighing from two to three pounds then he piled up twentyfive thousand crowns each worth about eighty francs of our money and bearing the effigies of Alexander VI	285.8747930160207
and his predecessors and he saw that the complement was not half empty	171.82755616318798
And he measured ten double handfuls of pearls diamonds and other gems many of which mounted by the most famous workmen were valuable beyond their intrinsic worth	604.6958803619679
Dants saw the light gradually disappear and fearing to be surprised in the cavern left it his gun in his hand	124.88065038435279
A piece of biscuit and a small quantity of rum formed his supper and he snatched a few hours sleep lying over the mouth of the cave	95.13362146807766
It was a night of joy and terror such as this man of stupendous emotions had already experienced twice or thrice in his lifetime	253.59166814275045
Day for which Dants had so eagerly and impatiently waited with open eyes again dawned	565.5635275770322
With the first light Dants resumed his search	193.71688056742263
Again he climbed the rocky height he had ascended the previous evening and strained his view to catch every peculiarity of the landscape but it wore the same wild barren aspect when seen by the rays of the morning sun which it had done when surveyed by the fading glimmer of eve	248.90766059853524
Descending into the grotto he lifted the stone filled his pockets with gems put the box together as well and securely as he could sprinkled fresh sand over the spot from which it had been taken and then carefully trod down the earth to give it everywhere a uniform appearance then quitting the grotto he replaced the stone heaping on it broken masses of rocks and rough fragments of crumbling granite filling the interstices with earth into which he deftly inserted rapidly growing plants such as the wild myrtle and flowering thorn then carefully watering these new plantations he scrupulously effaced every trace of footsteps leaving the approach to the cavern as savagelooking and untrodden as he had found it	361.7635702777515
This done he impatiently awaited the return of his companions	36.35004747062486
To wait at Monte Cristo for the purpose of watching like a dragon over the almost incalculable riches that had thus fallen into his possession satisfied not the cravings of his heart which yearned to return to dwell among mankind and to assume the rank power and influence which are always accorded to wealththat first and greatest of all the forces within the grasp of man	285.5427268137732
On the sixth day the smugglers returned	2200.1329920589296
From a distance Dants recognized the rig and handling of La Jeune Amlie and dragging himself with affected difficulty towards the landingplace he met his companions with an assurance that although considerably better than when they quitted him he still suffered acutely from his late accident	258.9837694482629
He then inquired how they had fared in their trip	628.0679511691666
To this question the smugglers replied that although successful in landing their cargo in safety they had scarcely done so when they received intelligence that a guardship had just quitted the port of Toulon and was crowding all sail towards them	292.8023103079018
This obliged them to make all the speed they could to evade the enemy when they could but lament the absence of Dants whose superior skill in the management of a vessel would have availed them so materially	186.34417338955973
In fact the pursuing vessel had almost overtaken them when fortunately night came on and enabled them to double the Cape of Corsica and so elude all further pursuit	585.6154898154676
Upon the whole however the trip had been sufficiently successful to satisfy all concerned while the crew and particularly Jacopo expressed great regrets that Dants had not been an equal sharer with themselves in the profits which amounted to no less a sum than fifty piastres each	457.178788746877
Edmond preserved the most admirable selfcommand not suffering the faintest indication of a smile to escape him at the enumeration of all the benefits he would have reaped had he been able to quit the island but as La Jeune Amlie had merely come to Monte Cristo to fetch him away he embarked that same evening and proceeded with the captain to Leghorn	199.84750983492756
Arrived at Leghorn he repaired to the house of a Jew a dealer in precious stones to whom he disposed of four of his smallest diamonds for five thousand francs each	128.7058551467458
Dants half feared that such valuable jewels in the hands of a poor sailor like himself might excite suspicion but the cunning purchaser asked no troublesome questions concerning a bargain by which he gained a round profit of at least eighty per cent	364.8384895956574
The following day Dants presented Jacopo with an entirely new vessel accompanying the gift by a donation of one hundred piastres that he might provide himself with a suitable crew and other requisites for his outfit upon condition that he would go at once to Marseilles for the purpose of inquiring after an old man named Louis Dants residing in the Alles de Meilhan and also a young woman called Mercds an inhabitant of the Catalan village	157.4442748402823
Jacopo could scarcely believe his senses at receiving this magnificent present which Dants hastened to account for by saying that he had merely been a sailor from whim and a desire to spite his family who did not allow him as much money as he liked to spend but that on his arrival at Leghorn he had come into possession of a large fortune left him by an uncle whose sole heir he was	160.8997249397514
The superior education of Dants gave an air of such extreme probability to this statement that it never once occurred to Jacopo to doubt its accuracy	291.7291176300857
The term for which Edmond had engaged to serve on board La Jeune Amlie having expired Dants took leave of the captain who at first tried all his powers of persuasion to induce him to remain as one of the crew but having been told the history of the legacy he ceased to importune him further	176.63358815713406
The following morning Jacopo set sail for Marseilles with directions from Dants to join him at the Island of Monte Cristo	51.67035459418202
Having seen Jacopo fairly out of the harbor Dants proceeded to make his final adieus on board La Jeune Amlie distributing so liberal a gratuity among her crew as to secure for him the good wishes of all and expressions of cordial interest in all that concerned him	302.1849460404341
To the captain he promised to write when he had made up his mind as to his future plans	57.8185846444923
At the moment of his arrival a small yacht was under trial in the bay this yacht had been built by order of an Englishman who having heard that the Genoese excelled all other builders along the shores of the Mediterranean in the construction of fastsailing vessels was desirous of possessing a specimen of their skill the price agreed upon between the Englishman and the Genoese builder was forty thousand francs	248.2859903365804
Dants struck with the beauty and capability of the little vessel applied to its owner to transfer it to him offering sixty thousand francs upon condition that he should be allowed to take immediate possession	140.58800909981738
The proposal was too advantageous to be refused the more so as the person for whom the yacht was intended had gone upon a tour through Switzerland and was not expected back in less than three weeks or a month by which time the builder reckoned upon being able to complete another	164.1832079563799
Dants led the owner of the yacht to the dwelling of a Jew retired with the latter for a few minutes to a small back parlor and upon their return the Jew counted out to the shipbuilder the sum of sixty thousand francs in bright gold pieces	115.44449723256092
The delighted builder then offered his services in providing a suitable crew for the little vessel but this Dants declined with many thanks saying he was accustomed to cruise about quite alone and his principal pleasure consisted in managing his yacht himself the only thing the builder could oblige him in would be to contrive a sort of secret closet in the cabin at his beds head the closet to contain three divisions so constructed as to be concealed from all but himself	355.3885589295023
The builder cheerfully undertook the commission and promised to have these secret places completed by the next day Dants furnishing the dimensions and plan in accordance with which they were to be constructed	262.04724779359475
Two hours afterward Dants sailed from the port of Genoa under the inspection of an immense crowd drawn together by curiosity to see the rich Spanish nobleman who preferred managing his own yacht	269.06683904389564
But their wonder was soon changed to admiration at seeing the perfect skill with which Dants handled the helm	395.7567554670653
The boat indeed seemed to be animated with almost human intelligence so promptly did it obey the slightest touch and Dants required but a short trial of his beautiful craft to acknowledge that the Genoese had not without reason attained their high reputation in the art of shipbuilding	362.012185578819
The spectators followed the little vessel with their eyes as long as it remained visible they then turned their conjectures upon her probable destination	310.6814911222986
Some insisted she was making for Corsica others the Island of Elba bets were offered to any amount that she was bound for Spain while Africa was positively reported by many persons as her intended course but no one thought of Monte Cristo	231.20872807181036
Yet thither it was that Dants guided his vessel and at Monte Cristo he arrived at the close of the second day his boat had proved herself a firstclass sailor and had come the distance from Genoa in thirtyfive hours	185.5748752190808
Dants had carefully noted the general appearance of the shore and instead of landing at the usual place he dropped anchor in the little creek	157.62143532988227
The island was utterly deserted and bore no evidence of having been visited since he went away his treasure was just as he had left it	92.63744852678536
Early on the following morning he commenced the removal of his riches and ere nightfall the whole of his immense wealth was safely deposited in the compartments of the secret locker	243.70105500271848
Dants employed it in manuvring his yacht round the island studying it as a skilful horseman would the animal he destined for some important service till at the end of that time he was perfectly conversant with its good and bad qualities	230.3872794658584
The former Dants proposed to augment the latter to remedy	352.8395789506618
Upon the eighth day he discerned a small vessel under full sail approaching Monte Cristo	501.6780318107677
As it drew near he recognized it as the boat he had given to Jacopo	115.03861380251149
His signal was returned and in two hours afterwards the newcomer lay at anchor beside the yacht	249.1101460255384
A mournful answer awaited each of Edmonds eager inquiries as to the information Jacopo had obtained	674.5145134771677
Old Dants was dead and Mercds had disappeared	329.1366540154456
Dants listened to these melancholy tidings with outward calmness but leaping lightly ashore he signified his desire to be quite alone	424.52623998573677
In a couple of hours he returned	135.58756427709645
Two of the men from Jacopos boat came on board the yacht to assist in navigating it and he gave orders that she should be steered direct to Marseilles	380.3888835293002
For his fathers death he was in some manner prepared but he knew not how to account for the mysterious disappearance of Mercds	123.2806625991217
Without divulging his secret Dants could not give sufficiently clear instructions to an agent	519.2181681129222
There were besides other particulars he was desirous of ascertaining and those were of a nature he alone could investigate in a manner satisfactory to himself	206.89410380414063
His lookingglass had assured him during his stay at Leghorn that he ran no risk of recognition moreover he had now the means of adopting any disguise he thought proper	377.37993792776314
One fine morning then his yacht followed by the little fishingboat boldly entered the port of Marseilles and anchored exactly opposite the spot from whence on the nevertobeforgotten night of his departure for the Chteau dIf he had been put on board the boat destined to convey him thither	176.862864401082
Still Dants could not view without a shudder the approach of a gendarme who accompanied the officers deputed to demand his bill of health ere the yacht was permitted to hold communication with the shore but with that perfect selfpossession he had acquired during his acquaintance with Faria Dants coolly presented an English passport he had obtained from Leghorn and as this gave him a standing which a French passport would not have afforded he was informed that there existed no obstacle to his immediate debarkation	262.2942233374843
The first person to attract the attention of Dants as he landed on the Canebire was one of the crew belonging to the Pharaon	72.32308641611033
Edmond welcomed the meeting with this fellowwho had been one of his own sailorsas a sure means of testing the extent of the change which time had worked in his own appearance	152.3258817576862
Going straight towards him he propounded a variety of questions on different subjects carefully watching the mans countenance as he did so but not a word or look implied that he had the slightest idea of ever having seen before the person with whom he was then conversing	163.3000027406147
Giving the sailor a piece of money in return for his civility Dants proceeded onwards but ere he had gone many steps he heard the man loudly calling him to stop	177.22500610524565
Dants instantly turned to meet him	2.169388552788736
I beg your pardon sir said the honest fellow in almost breathless haste but I believe you made a mistake you intended to give me a twofranc piece and see you gave me a double Napoleon	149.9620889077618
I see that I have made a trifling mistake as you say but by way of rewarding your honesty I give you another double Napoleon that you may drink to my health and be able to ask your messmates to join you	150.3658022523135
So extreme was the surprise of the sailor that he was unable even to thank Edmond whose receding figure he continued to gaze after in speechless astonishment	366.20057436218536
Some nabob from India was his comment	5412.3538063523865
Dants meanwhile went on his way	7.621312804511707
Each step he trod oppressed his heart with fresh emotion his first and most indelible recollections were there not a tree not a street that he passed but seemed filled with dear and cherished memories	412.83259433978793
And thus he proceeded onwards till he arrived at the end of the Rue de Noailles from whence a full view of the Alles de Meilhan was obtained	35.374295000433676
At this spot so pregnant with fond and filial remembrances his heart beat almost to bursting his knees tottered under him a mist floated over his sight and had he not clung for support to one of the trees he would inevitably have fallen to the ground and been crushed beneath the many vehicles continually passing there	207.68537496281883
Recovering himself however he wiped the perspiration from his brows and stopped not again till he found himself at the door of the house in which his father had lived	29.48386411783293
The nasturtiums and other plants which his father had delighted to train before his window had all disappeared from the upper part of the house	96.51015065620803
Leaning against the tree he gazed thoughtfully for a time at the upper stories of the shabby little house	229.64631614610158
Then he advanced to the door and asked whether there were any rooms to be let	131.41446385453713
Though answered in the negative he begged so earnestly to be permitted to visit those on the fifth floor that in despite of the oftrepeated assurance of the concierge that they were occupied Dants succeeded in inducing the man to go up to the tenants and ask permission for a gentleman to be allowed to look at them	108.64781089545615
The tenants of the humble lodging were a young couple who had been scarcely married a week and seeing them Dants sighed heavily	269.47725744485456
Nothing in the two small chambers forming the apartments remained as it had been in the time of the elder Dants the very paper was different while the articles of antiquated furniture with which the rooms had been filled in Edmonds time had all disappeared the four walls alone remained as he had left them	142.80373896226857
The bed belonging to the present occupants was placed as the former owner of the chamber had been accustomed to have his and in spite of his efforts to prevent it the eyes of Edmond were suffused in tears as he reflected that on that spot the old man had breathed his last vainly calling for his son	114.96236780647575
The young couple gazed with astonishment at the sight of their visitors emotion and wondered to see the large tears silently chasing each other down his otherwise stern and immovable features but they felt the sacredness of his grief and kindly refrained from questioning him as to its cause while with instinctive delicacy they left him to indulge his sorrow alone	255.75158009038142
When he withdrew from the scene of his painful recollections they both accompanied him downstairs reiterating their hope that he would come again whenever he pleased and assuring him that their poor dwelling would ever be open to him	263.8870195745276
As Edmond passed the door on the fourth floor he paused to inquire whether Caderousse the tailor still dwelt there but he received for reply that the person in question had got into difficulties and at the present time kept a small inn on the route from Bellegarde to Beaucaire	138.69766459237906
Having obtained the address of the person to whom the house in the Alles de Meilhan belonged Dants next proceeded thither and under the name of Lord Wilmore the name and title inscribed on his passport purchased the small dwelling for the sum of twentyfive thousand francs at least ten thousand more than it was worth but had its owner asked half a million it would unhesitatingly have been given	89.83705876972377
The very same day the occupants of the apartments on the fifth floor of the house now become the property of Dants were duly informed by the notary who had arranged the necessary transfer of deeds etc	120.87650031376045
that the new landlord gave them their choice of any of the rooms in the house without the least augmentation of rent upon condition of their giving instant possession of the two small chambers they at present inhabited	226.75276246139916
This strange event aroused great wonder and curiosity in the neighborhood of the Alles de Meilhan and a multitude of theories were afloat none of which was anywhere near the truth	132.19591745474207
But what raised public astonishment to a climax and set all conjecture at defiance was the knowledge that the same stranger who had in the morning visited the Alles de Meilhan had been seen in the evening walking in the little village of the Catalans and afterwards observed to enter a poor fishermans hut and to pass more than an hour in inquiring after persons who had either been dead or gone away for more than fifteen or sixteen years	133.55049583065247
But on the following day the family from whom all these particulars had been asked received a handsome present consisting of an entirely new fishingboat with two seines and a tender	369.4849428115911
The delighted recipients of these munificent gifts would gladly have poured out their thanks to their generous benefactor but they had seen him upon quitting the hut merely give some orders to a sailor and then springing lightly on horseback leave Marseilles by the Porte dAix	299.80371678493054
Such of my readers as have made a pedestrian excursion to the south of France may perchance have noticed about midway between the town of Beaucaire and the village of Bellegardea little nearer to the former than to the lattera small roadside inn from the front of which hung creaking and flapping in the wind a sheet of tin covered with a grotesque representation of the Pont du Gard	226.54288312982993
This modern place of entertainment stood on the lefthand side of the post road and backed upon the Rhne	218.45076008619097
It also boasted of what in Languedoc is styled a garden consisting of a small plot of ground on the side opposite to the main entrance reserved for the reception of guests	213.40411744573146
A few dingy olives and stunted figtrees struggled hard for existence but their withered dusty foliage abundantly proved how unequal was the conflict	3572.564588372556
Between these sickly shrubs grew a scanty supply of garlic tomatoes and eschalots while lone and solitary like a forgotten sentinel a tall pine raised its melancholy head in one of the corners of this unattractive spot and displayed its flexible stem and fanshaped summit dried and cracked by the fierce heat of the subtropical sun	605.4863850281314
All these trees great or small were turned in the direction to which the Mistral blows one of the three curses of Provence the others being the Durance and the Parliament	301.7125685240396
In the surrounding plain which more resembled a dusty lake than solid ground were scattered a few miserable stalks of wheat the effect no doubt of a curious desire on the part of the agriculturists of the country to see whether such a thing as the raising of grain in those parched regions was practicable	260.0095776710987
Each stalk served as a perch for a grasshopper which regaled the passersby through this Egyptian scene with its strident monotonous note	840.0163245894612
For about seven or eight years the little tavern had been kept by a man and his wife with two servantsa chambermaid named Trinette and a hostler called Pecaud	325.9548240989721
This small staff was quite equal to all the requirements for a canal between Beaucaire and Aiguemortes had revolutionized transportation by substituting boats for the cart and the stagecoach	583.773962194572
And as though to add to the daily misery which this prosperous canal inflicted on the unfortunate innkeeper whose utter ruin it was fast accomplishing it was situated between the Rhne from which it had its source and the postroad it had depleted not a hundred steps from the inn of which we have given a brief but faithful description	271.77332206401087
The innkeeper himself was a man of from forty to fiftyfive years of age tall strong and bony a perfect specimen of the natives of those southern latitudes he had dark sparkling and deepset eyes hooked nose and teeth white as those of a carnivorous animal his hair like his beard which he wore under his chin was thick and curly and in spite of his age but slightly interspersed with a few silvery threads	256.716646362192
His naturally dark complexion had assumed a still further shade of brown from the habit the unfortunate man had acquired of stationing himself from morning till eve at the threshold of his door on the lookout for guests who seldom came yet there he stood day after day exposed to the meridional rays of a burning sun with no other protection for his head than a red handkerchief twisted around it after the manner of the Spanish muleteers	299.5800346005287
This man was our old acquaintance Gaspard Caderousse	1534.7347090870392
His wife on the contrary whose maiden name had been Madeleine Radelle was pale meagre and sicklylooking	1805.611014734906
Born in the neighborhood of Arles she had shared in the beauty for which its women are proverbial but that beauty had gradually withered beneath the devastating influence of the slow fever so prevalent among dwellers by the ponds of Aiguemortes and the marshes of Camargue	446.08767066885156
She remained nearly always in her secondfloor chamber shivering in her chair or stretched languid and feeble on her bed while her husband kept his daily watch at the doora duty he performed with so much the greater willingness as it saved him the necessity of listening to the endless plaints and murmurs of his helpmate who never saw him without breaking out into bitter invectives against fate to all of which her husband would calmly return an unvarying reply in these philosophic words	391.3508716930389
It is Gods pleasure that things should be so	72.72735880032863
The sobriquet of La Carconte had been bestowed on Madeleine Radelle from the fact that she had been born in a village so called situated between Salon and Lambesc and as a custom existed among the inhabitants of that part of France where Caderousse lived of styling every person by some particular and distinctive appellation her husband had bestowed on her the name of La Carconte in place of her sweet and euphonious name of Madeleine which in all probability his rude gutteral language would not have enabled him to pronounce	198.7417717802659
Still let it not be supposed that amid this affected resignation to the will of Providence the unfortunate innkeeper did not writhe under the double misery of seeing the hateful canal carry off his customers and his profits and the daily infliction of his peevish partners murmurs and lamentations	533.3072285401067
Like other dwellers in the south he was a man of sober habits and moderate desires but fond of external show vain and addicted to display	827.5065384894735
During the days of his prosperity not a festivity took place without himself and wife being among the spectators	404.0308755611839
He dressed in the picturesque costume worn upon grand occasions by the inhabitants of the south of France bearing equal resemblance to the style adopted both by the Catalans and Andalusians while La Carconte displayed the charming fashion prevalent among the women of Arles a mode of attire borrowed equally from Greece and Arabia	464.9695664197341
But by degrees watchchains necklaces particolored scarves embroidered bodices velvet vests elegantly worked stockings striped gaiters and silver buckles for the shoes all disappeared and Gaspard Caderousse unable to appear abroad in his pristine splendor had given up any further participation in the pomps and vanities both for himself and wife although a bitter feeling of envious discontent filled his mind as the sound of mirth and merry music from the joyous revellers reached even the miserable hostelry to which he still clung more for the shelter than the profit it afforded	591.8401035941158
Caderousse then was as usual at his place of observation before the door his eyes glancing listlessly from a piece of closely shaven grasson which some fowls were industriously though fruitlessly endeavoring to turn up some grain or insect suited to their palateto the deserted road which led away to the north and south when he was aroused by the shrill voice of his wife and grumbling to himself as he went he mounted to her chamber first taking care however to set the entrance door wide open as an invitation to any chance traveller who might be passing	244.82511205833558
At the moment Caderousse quitted his sentrylike watch before the door the road on which he so eagerly strained his sight was void and lonely as a desert at midday	288.3483030745476
There it lay stretching out into one interminable line of dust and sand with its sides bordered by tall meagre trees altogether presenting so uninviting an appearance that no one in his senses could have imagined that any traveller at liberty to regulate his hours for journeying would choose to expose himself in such a formidable Sahara	302.14321032972333
Nevertheless had Caderousse but retained his post a few minutes longer he might have caught a dim outline of something approaching from the direction of Bellegarde as the moving object drew nearer he would easily have perceived that it consisted of a man and horse between whom the kindest and most amiable understanding appeared to exist	186.57714584817862
The horse was of Hungarian breed and ambled along at an easy pace	647.1750643072987
His rider was a priest dressed in black and wearing a threecornered hat and spite of the ardent rays of a noonday sun the pair came on with a fair degree of rapidity	162.13441371104068
Having arrived before the Pont du Gard the horse stopped but whether for his own pleasure or that of his rider would have been difficult to say	70.4446002651326
However that might have been the priest dismounting led his steed by the bridle in search of some place to which he could secure him	129.2454717513716
Availing himself of a handle that projected from a halffallen door he tied the animal safely and having drawn a red cotton handkerchief from his pocket wiped away the perspiration that streamed from his brow then advancing to the door struck thrice with the end of his ironshod stick	159.28963787758872
At this unusual sound a huge black dog came rushing to meet the daring assailant of his ordinarily tranquil abode snarling and displaying his sharp white teeth with a determined hostility that abundantly proved how little he was accustomed to society	555.4004010773194
At that moment a heavy footstep was heard descending the wooden staircase that led from the upper floor and with many bows and courteous smiles the host of the Pont du Gard besought his guest to enter	100.41943558544502
You are welcome sir most welcome repeated the astonished Caderousse	305.49009840745526
Now then Margotin cried he speaking to the dog will you be quiet Pray do nt heed him sirhe only barks he never bites	774.593220982289
I make no doubt a glass of good wine would be acceptable this dreadfully hot day	365.70763427698245
Then perceiving for the first time the garb of the traveller he had to entertain Caderousse hastily exclaimed A thousand pardons I really did not observe whom I had the honor to receive under my poor roof	137.4228392703303
What would the abb please to have What refreshment can I offer All I have is at his service	223.63220098986574
The priest gazed on the person addressing him with a long and searching gazethere even seemed a disposition on his part to court a similar scrutiny on the part of the innkeeper then observing in the countenance of the latter no other expression than extreme surprise at his own want of attention to an inquiry so courteously worded he deemed it as well to terminate this dumb show and therefore said speaking with a strong Italian accent You are I presume M	214.4105952515397
Yes sir answered the host even more surprised at the question than he had been by the silence which had preceded it I am Gaspard Caderousse at your service	91.36223674990204
YesChristian and surname are the same	19.439393638914314
You formerly lived I believe in the Alles de Meilhan on the fourth floor	26.90020295340481
And you followed the business of a tailor	69.19054697684479
True I was a tailor till the trade fell off	1170.4606787241037
It is so hot at Marseilles that really I believe that the respectable inhabitants will in time go without any clothing whatever	525.4739182045763
But talking of heat is there nothing I can offer you by way of refreshment	130.84591890582055
Yes let me have a bottle of your best wine and then with your permission we will resume our conversation from where we left off	99.47896035287182
As you please sir said Caderousse who anxious not to lose the present opportunity of finding a customer for one of the few bottles of Cahors still remaining in his possession hastily raised a trapdoor in the floor of the apartment they were in which served both as parlor and kitchen	167.4681857928229
Upon issuing forth from his subterranean retreat at the expiration of five minutes he found the abb seated upon a wooden stool leaning his elbow on a table while Margotin whose animosity seemed appeased by the unusual command of the traveller for refreshments had crept up to him and had established himself very comfortably between his knees his long skinny neck resting on his lap while his dim eye was fixed earnestly on the travellers face	193.82436987366822
Are you quite alone inquired the guest as Caderousse placed before him the bottle of wine and a glass	74.53826994219845
Quite quite alone replied the manor at least practically so for my poor wife who is the only person in the house besides myself is laid up with illness and unable to render me the least assistance poor thing	194.7147785693271
You are married then said the priest with a show of interest glancing round as he spoke at the scanty furnishings of the apartment	133.47240353920992
Ah sir said Caderousse with a sigh it is easy to perceive I am not a rich man but in this world a man does not thrive the better for being honest	54.04454885484582
The abb fixed on him a searching penetrating glance	1532.2677820737374
Yes honestI can certainly say that much for myself continued the innkeeper fairly sustaining the scrutiny of the abbs gaze I can boast with truth of being an honest man and continued he significantly with a hand on his breast and shaking his head that is more than everyone can say nowadays	155.0244285853613
So much the better for you if what you assert be true said the abb for I am firmly persuaded that sooner or later the good will be rewarded and the wicked punished	217.9384671393613
Such words as those belong to your profession answered Caderousse and you do well to repeat them but added he with a bitter expression of countenance one is free to believe them or not as one pleases	95.79849959306912
You are wrong to speak thus said the abb and perhaps I may in my own person be able to prove to you how completely you are in error	89.4697839758428
What mean you inquired Caderousse with a look of surprise	10.738526820086488
In the first place I must be satisfied that you are the person I am in search of	26.637112414678846
Did you in the year 1814 or 1815 know anything of a young sailor named Dants	220.39366608686245
Dants Did I know poor dear Edmond Why Edmond Dants and myself were intimate friends exclaimed Caderousse whose countenance flushed darkly as he caught the penetrating gaze of the abb fixed on him while the clear calm eye of the questioner seemed to dilate with feverish scrutiny	264.7625069071937
You remind me said the priest that the young man concerning whom I asked you was said to bear the name of Edmond	63.08574962383531
Said to bear the name repeated Caderousse becoming excited and eager	1165.6963806000806
Why he was so called as truly as I myself bore the appellation of Gaspard Caderousse but tell me I pray what has become of poor Edmond Did you know him Is he alive and at liberty Is he prosperous and happy	115.1118886679827
He died a more wretched hopeless heartbroken prisoner than the felons who pay the penalty of their crimes at the galleys of Toulon	233.79560511314202
A deadly pallor followed the flush on the countenance of Caderousse who turned away and the priest saw him wiping the tears from his eyes with the corner of the red handkerchief twisted round his head	64.87985222488199
Poor fellow poor fellow murmured Caderousse	91.90656444568978
Well there sir is another proof that good people are never rewarded on this earth and that none but the wicked prosper	298.07394173493327
Ah continued Caderousse speaking in the highly colored language of the South the world grows worse and worse	572.2169159684444
Why does not God if he really hates the wicked as he is said to do send down brimstone and fire and consume them altogether	531.2486258146672
You speak as though you had loved this young Dants observed the abb without taking any notice of his companions vehemence	188.11314682474455
And so I did replied Caderousse though once I confess I envied him his good fortune	305.10316266292745
But I swear to you sir I swear to you by everything a man holds dear I have since then deeply and sincerely lamented his unhappy fate	394.970100273753
There was a brief silence during which the fixed searching eye of the abb was employed in scrutinizing the agitated features of the innkeeper	133.94677081294873
You knew the poor lad then continued Caderousse	540.1768047520987
I was called to see him on his dying bed that I might administer to him the consolations of religion	190.32746736440382
And of what did he die asked Caderousse in a choking voice	74.55742987475435
Of what think you do young and strong men die in prison when they have scarcely numbered their thirtieth year unless it be of imprisonment Caderousse wiped away the large beads of perspiration that gathered on his brow	376.7733145826368
But the strangest part of the story is resumed the abb that Dants even in his dying moments swore by his crucified Redeemer that he was utterly ignorant of the cause of his detention	245.69709987240745
And so he was murmured Caderousse	53.28544330356193
How should he have been otherwise Ah sir the poor fellow told you the truth	175.76779466617793
And for that reason he besought me to try and clear up a mystery he had never been able to penetrate and to clear his memory should any foul spot or stain have fallen on it	212.38531832867528
And here the look of the abb becoming more and more fixed seemed to rest with illconcealed satisfaction on the gloomy depression which was rapidly spreading over the countenance of Caderousse	190.99885996595222
A rich Englishman continued the abb who had been his companion in misfortune but had been released from prison during the second restoration was possessed of a diamond of immense value this jewel he bestowed on Dants upon himself quitting the prison as a mark of his gratitude for the kindness and brotherly care with which Dants had nursed him in a severe illness he underwent during his confinement	199.84432312869677
Instead of employing this diamond in attempting to bribe his jailers who might only have taken it and then betrayed him to the governor Dants carefully preserved it that in the event of his getting out of prison he might have wherewithal to live for the sale of such a diamond would have quite sufficed to make his fortune	110.75885079990506
Then I suppose asked Caderousse with eager glowing looks that it was a stone of immense value	220.52995377247677
Why everything is relative answered the abb	13.927532291071259
To one in Edmonds position the diamond certainly was of great value	389.6312311841378
It was estimated at fifty thousand francs	4.331526030285341
Bless me exclaimed Caderousse fifty thousand francs Surely the diamond was as large as a nut to be worth all that	78.86509723516275
No replied the abb it was not of such a size as that but you shall judge for yourself	70.59505460621222
The sharp gaze of Caderousse was instantly directed towards the priests garments as though hoping to discover the location of the treasure	217.14711385158208
Calmly drawing forth from his pocket a small box covered with black shagreen the abb opened it and displayed to the dazzled eyes of Caderousse the sparkling jewel it contained set in a ring of admirable workmanship	158.84541395605268
And that diamond cried Caderousse almost breathless with eager admiration you say is worth fifty thousand francs	94.88066110607899
It is without the setting which is also valuable replied the abb as he closed the box and returned it to his pocket while its brilliant hues seemed still to dance before the eyes of the fascinated innkeeper	103.11271261802118
But how comes the diamond in your possession sir Did Edmond make you his heir	224.75360881115273
I once possessed four dear and faithful friends besides the maiden to whom I was betrothed he said and I feel convinced they have all unfeignedly grieved over my loss	240.7853478445924
The name of one of the four friends is Caderousse	210.06790282407195
Another of the number continued the abb without seeming to notice the emotion of Caderousse is called Danglars and the third in spite of being my rival entertained a very sincere affection for me	101.190481972572
A fiendish smile played over the features of Caderousse who was about to break in upon the abbs speech when the latter waving his hand said Allow me to finish first and then if you have any observations to make you can do so afterwards	99.5245402199754
The third of my friends although my rival was much attached to mehis name was Fernand that of my betrothed wasStay stay continued the abb I have forgotten what he called her	288.2505172457851
True said the abb with a stifled sigh Mercds it was	72.06498924548485
Bring me a carafe of water said the abb	75.68919985541648
Caderousse quickly performed the strangers bidding and after pouring some into a glass and slowly swallowing its contents the abb resuming his usual placidity of manner said as he placed his empty glass on the table	173.91440257683752
The name of Edmonds betrothed was Mercds	621.16315428844
You will go to Marseilles said Dantsfor you understand I repeat his words just as he uttered them	142.87719792435945
You will sell this diamond you will divide the money into five equal parts and give an equal portion to these good friends the only persons who have loved me upon earth	134.43945951154177
But why into five parts asked Caderousse you only mentioned four persons	269.6712972245084
Because the fifth is dead as I hear	101.2929244033983
The fifth sharer in Edmonds bequest was his own father	294.7686735488082
Too true too true ejaculated Caderousse almost suffocated by the contending passions which assailed him the poor old man did die	184.4623093910776
I learned so much at Marseilles replied the abb making a strong effort to appear indifferent but from the length of time that has elapsed since the death of the elder Dants I was unable to obtain any particulars of his end	77.73408297608
Can you enlighten me on that point	48.871043860149186
I do not know who could if I could not said Caderousse	81.92049344279692
Why I lived almost on the same floor with the poor old man	17.64983292214858
Ah yes about a year after the disappearance of his son the poor old man died	50.481722643482456
Why the doctors called his complaint gastroenteritis I believe his acquaintances say he died of grief but I who saw him in his dying moments I say he died of	176.11138546050023
Of what asked the priest anxiously and eagerly	480.84492565706785
Starvation exclaimed the abb springing from his seat	9.579225138227088
Why the vilest animals are not suffered to die by such a death as that	69.31228841001176
The very dogs that wander houseless and homeless in the streets find some pitying hand to cast them a mouthful of bread and that a man a Christian should be allowed to perish of hunger in the midst of other men who call themselves Christians is too horrible for belief	203.55086391466136
What I have said I have said answered Caderousse	134.37497719673505
And you are a fool for having said anything about it said a voice from the top of the stairs	39.21393406772509
Why should you meddle with what does not concern you	68.29127837054824
The two men turned quickly and saw the sickly countenance of La Carconte peering between the baluster rails attracted by the sound of voices she had feebly dragged herself down the stairs and seated on the lower step head on knees she had listened to the foregoing conversation	192.04327473515852
Mind your own business wife replied Caderousse sharply	319.6680525939228
This gentleman asks me for information which common politeness will not permit me to refuse	183.68013725579334
Politeness you simpleton retorted La Carconte	2.3358864926104075
What have you to do with politeness I should like to know Better study a little common prudence	383.2565434411226
How do you know the motives that person may have for trying to extract all he can from you	295.1944454999623
I pledge you my word madam said the abb that my intentions are good and that your husband can incur no risk provided he answers me candidly	277.1699023950462
Ah that s all very fine retorted the woman	287.39252813876357
Nothing is easier than to begin with fair promises and assurances of nothing to fear but when poor silly folks like my husband there have been persuaded to tell all they know the promises and assurances of safety are quickly forgotten and at some moment when nobody is expecting it behold trouble and misery and all sorts of persecutions are heaped on the unfortunate wretches who can not even see whence all their afflictions come	391.101118550492
Nay nay my good woman make yourself perfectly easy I beg of you	75.92465244127763
Whatever evils may befall you they will not be occasioned by my instrumentality that I solemnly promise you	105.82841968143957
La Carconte muttered a few inarticulate words then let her head again drop upon her knees and went into a fit of ague leaving the two speakers to resume the conversation but remaining so as to be able to hear every word they uttered	89.06545159702868
Again the abb had been obliged to swallow a draught of water to calm the emotions that threatened to overpower him	199.38101206838485
When he had sufficiently recovered himself he said It appears then that the miserable old man you were telling me of was forsaken by everyone	151.32842433634278
Surely had not such been the case he would not have perished by so dreadful a death	61.84935613548172
Why he was not altogether forsaken continued Caderousse for Mercds the Catalan and Monsieur Morrel were very kind to him but somehow the poor old man had contracted a profound hatred for Fernandthe very person added Caderousse with a bitter smile that you named just now as being one of Dants faithful and attached friends	269.401071737891
And was he not so asked the abb	152.56929481014757
Gaspard Gaspard murmured the woman from her seat on the stairs mind what you are saying	90.75278000687659
Caderousse made no reply to these words though evidently irritated and annoyed by the interruption but addressing the abb said Can a man be faithful to another whose wife he covets and desires for himself But Dants was so honorable and true in his own nature that he believed everybodys professions of friendship	340.7650302399813
Poor Edmond he was cruelly deceived but it was fortunate that he never knew or he might have found it more difficult when on his deathbed to pardon his enemies	101.83147261288191
And whatever people may say continued Caderousse in his native language which was not altogether devoid of rude poetry I can not help being more frightened at the idea of the malediction of the dead than the hatred of the living	152.28388232247076
Do you then know in what manner Fernand injured Dants inquired the abb of Caderousse	500.852248706865
Speak out then say what it was	11.896788977615516
Gaspard cried La Carconte do as you will you are masterbut if you take my advice you ll hold your tongue	144.95333840299367
Well wife replied Caderousse I do nt know but what you re right	69.61906661997898
So you will say nothing asked the abb	19.42392449166308
Why what good would it do asked Caderousse	134.81573073258707
If the poor lad were living and came to me and begged that I would candidly tell which were his true and which his false friends why perhaps I should not hesitate	240.35608989003467
But you tell me he is no more and therefore can have nothing to do with hatred or revenge so let all such feeling be buried with him	130.30024415705032
You prefer then said the abb that I should bestow on men you say are false and treacherous the reward intended for faithful friendship	329.3204998431659
That is true enough returned Caderousse	301.37732652799997
You say truly the gift of poor Edmond was not meant for such traitors as Fernand and Danglars besides what would it be to them no more than a drop of water in the ocean	88.46540597668952
Remember chimed in La Carconte those two could crush you at a single blow	154.85809554106547
Are these persons then so rich and powerful	50.51396906685511
Do you not know their history	3121.09880274611
Caderousse seemed to reflect for a few moments then said No truly it would take up too much time	77.61389924120715
Well my good friend returned the abb in a tone that indicated utter indifference on his part you are at liberty either to speak or be silent just as you please for my own part I respect your scruples and admire your sentiments so let the matter end	102.37681745140405
I shall do my duty as conscientiously as I can and fulfil my promise to the dying man	117.06309637406488
My first business will be to dispose of this diamond	131.72406766597643
So saying the abb again drew the small box from his pocket opened it and contrived to hold it in such a light that a bright flash of brilliant hues passed before the dazzled gaze of Caderousse	92.23191531234995
Wife wife cried he in a hoarse voice come here	49.07803647942187
Diamond exclaimed La Carconte rising and descending to the chamber with a tolerably firm step what diamond are you talking about	117.27908735626352
Why did you not hear all we said inquired Caderousse	261.26810042654245
It is a beautiful diamond left by poor Edmond Dants to be sold and the money divided between his father Mercds his betrothed bride Fernand Danglars and myself	290.8817258186178
The jewel is worth at least fifty thousand francs	6.685691493994311
Oh what a magnificent jewel cried the astonished woman	94.33389925436046
The fifth part of the profits from this stone belongs to us then does it not asked Caderousse	173.48022267103943
It does replied the abb with the addition of an equal division of that part intended for the elder Dants which I believe myself at liberty to divide equally with the four survivors	176.90287531710143
And why among us four inquired Caderousse	1539.70251011258
As being the friends Edmond esteemed most faithful and devoted to him	123.95708797798352
I do nt call those friends who betray and ruin you murmured the wife in her turn in a low muttering voice	131.51706913408762
Of course not rejoined Caderousse quickly no more do I and that was what I was observing to this gentleman just now	115.48034733648332
I said I looked upon it as a sacrilegious profanation to reward treachery perhaps crime	1262.6974436026333
Remember answered the abb calmly as he replaced the jewel and its case in the pocket of his cassock it is your fault not mine that I do so	79.19183479288621
You will have the goodness to furnish me with the address of both Fernand and Danglars in order that I may execute Edmonds last wishes	189.17791467106167
The agitation of Caderousse became extreme and large drops of perspiration rolled from his heated brow	126.67690911021141
As he saw the abb rise from his seat and go towards the door as though to ascertain if his horse were sufficiently refreshed to continue his journey Caderousse and his wife exchanged looks of deep meaning	92.44283138248987
There you see wife said the former this splendid diamond might all be ours if we chose	498.3066819120643
Why surely a man of his holy profession would not deceive us	170.36270892063982
Well replied La Carconte do as you like	27.98569732424827
For my part I wash my hands of the affair	45.11551833119277
So saying she once more climbed the staircase leading to her chamber her body convulsed with chills and her teeth rattling in her head in spite of the intense heat of the weather	150.66935731300816
Arrived at the top stair she turned round and called out in a warning tone to her husband Gaspard consider well what you are about to do	98.56284314475009
I have both reflected and decided answered he	1743.9482379080214
La Carconte then entered her chamber the flooring of which creaked beneath her heavy uncertain tread as she proceeded towards her armchair into which she fell as though exhausted	192.88950941185965
Well asked the abb as he returned to the apartment below what have you made up your mind to do	57.30302494799458
To tell you all I know was the reply	171.88000433525008
I certainly think you act wisely in so doing said the priest	167.11137981891105
Not because I have the least desire to learn anything you may please to conceal from me but simply that if through your assistance I could distribute the legacy according to the wishes of the testator why so much the better that is all	152.0815845966832
I hope it may be so replied Caderousse his face flushed with cupidity	167.77535837669697
I am all attention said the abb	14.70440790680639
Stop a minute answered Caderousse we might be interrupted in the most interesting part of my story which would be a pity and it is as well that your visit hither should be made known only to ourselves	98.7323091292789
With these words he went stealthily to the door which he closed and by way of still greater precaution bolted and barred it as he was accustomed to do at night	109.25086453763504
During this time the abb had chosen his place for listening at his ease	82.85336201855831
He removed his seat into a corner of the room where he himself would be in deep shadow while the light would be fully thrown on the narrator then with head bent down and hands clasped or rather clenched together he prepared to give his whole attention to Caderousse who seated himself on the little stool exactly opposite to him	104.02293527583542
Remember this is no affair of mine said the trembling voice of La Carconte as though through the flooring of her chamber she viewed the scene that was enacting below	119.74310469442803
Enough enough replied Caderousse say no more about it I will take all the consequences upon myself	57.858536283636816
First sir said Caderousse you must make me a promise	39.36512578327801
What is that inquired the abb	42.62970527586421
Why if you ever make use of the details I am about to give you that you will never let anyone know that it was I who supplied them for the persons of whom I am about to talk are rich and powerful and if they only laid the tips of their fingers on me I should break to pieces like glass	61.696207983664436
Make yourself easy my friend replied the abb	22.367217834879014
I am a priest and confessions die in my breast	256.88344003426386
Recollect our only desire is to carry out in a fitting manner the last wishes of our friend	95.28787246380884
Speak then without reserve as without hatred tell the truth the whole truth I do not know never may know the persons of whom you are about to speak besides I am an Italian and not a Frenchman and belong to God and not to man and I shall shortly retire to my convent which I have only quitted to fulfil the last wishes of a dying man	90.76269310024463
This positive assurance seemed to give Caderousse a little courage	245.52445584790567
Well then under these circumstances said Caderousse I will I even believe I ought to undeceive you as to the friendship which poor Edmond thought so sincere and unquestionable	147.38409666908814
Begin with his father if you please	5.784948821542419
said the abb Edmond talked to me a great deal about the old man for whom he had the deepest love	43.79622196848265
The history is a sad one sir said Caderousse shaking his head perhaps you know all the earlier part of it	80.81033245890723
answered the abb Edmond related to me everything until the moment when he was arrested in a small cabaret close to Marseilles	107.76807751135826
At La Rserve Oh yes I can see it all before me this moment	45.50285286441335
Was it not his betrothal feast	15984.72727337027
It was and the feast that began so gayly had a very sorrowful ending a police commissary followed by four soldiers entered and Dants was arrested	578.8376663943816
Yes and up to this point I know all said the priest	72.16152257180812
Dants himself only knew that which personally concerned him for he never beheld again the five persons I have named to you or heard mention of anyone of them	174.1585292562492
Well when Dants was arrested Monsieur Morrel hastened to obtain the particulars and they were very sad	101.41953850128519
The old man returned alone to his home folded up his wedding suit with tears in his eyes and paced up and down his chamber the whole day and would not go to bed at all for I was underneath him and heard him walking the whole night and for myself I assure you I could not sleep either for the grief of the poor father gave me great uneasiness and every step he took went to my heart as really as if his foot had pressed against my breast	74.07544778086152
The next day Mercds came to implore the protection of M	76.12239954054571
de Villefort she did not obtain it however and went to visit the old man when she saw him so miserable and heartbroken having passed a sleepless night and not touched food since the previous day she wished him to go with her that she might take care of him but the old man would not consent	102.40996790415923
No was the old mans reply I will not leave this house for my poor dear boy loves me better than anything in the world and if he gets out of prison he will come and see me the first thing and what would he think if I did not wait here for him I heard all this from the window for I was anxious that Mercds should persuade the old man to accompany her for his footsteps over my head night and day did not leave me a moments repose	85.79487384289257
But did you not go upstairs and try to console the poor old man asked the abb	50.76680513475466
Ah sir replied Caderousse we can not console those who will not be consoled and he was one of these besides I know not why but he seemed to dislike seeing me	83.50387400071395
One night however I heard his sobs and I could not resist my desire to go up to him but when I reached his door he was no longer weeping but praying	61.28145782377216
I can not now repeat to you sir all the eloquent words and imploring language he made use of it was more than piety it was more than grief and I who am no canter and hate the Jesuits said then to myself It is really well and I am very glad that I have not any children for if I were a father and felt such excessive grief as the old man does and did not find in my memory or heart all he is now saying I should throw myself into the sea at once for I could not bear it	103.55303239641115
From day to day he lived on alone and more and more solitary	235.93330683201643
Morrel and Mercds came to see him but his door was closed and although I was certain he was at home he would not make any answer	42.544284803309516
One day when contrary to his custom he had admitted Mercds and the poor girl in spite of her own grief and despair endeavored to console him he said to herBe assured my dear daughter he is dead and instead of expecting him it is he who is awaiting us I am quite happy for I am the oldest and of course shall see him first	77.16767038710317
However well disposed a person may be why you see we leave off after a time seeing persons who are in sorrow they make one melancholy and so at last old Dants was left all to himself and I only saw from time to time strangers go up to him and come down again with some bundle they tried to hide but I guessed what these bundles were and that he sold by degrees what he had to pay for his subsistence	115.63998157659732
At length the poor old fellow reached the end of all he had he owed three quarters rent and they threatened to turn him out he begged for another week which was granted to him	203.26265316981986
I know this because the landlord came into my apartment when he left his	112.02839704311415
For the first three days I heard him walking about as usual but on the fourth I heard nothing	81.04318348937282
I then resolved to go up to him at all risks	26.15452124583455
The door was closed but I looked through the keyhole and saw him so pale and haggard that believing him very ill I went and told M	143.95569690055385
Morrel and then ran on to Mercds	1103.4545401871196
Morrel bringing a doctor and the doctor said it was inflammation of the bowels and ordered him a limited diet	326.2939826665368
I was there too and I never shall forget the old mans smile at this prescription	129.6313228814248
From that time he received all who came he had an excuse for not eating any more the doctor had put him on a diet	159.68834050908148
The abb uttered a kind of groan	30.303199682262672
The story interests you does it not sir inquired Caderousse	106.21559903581353
Yes replied the abb it is very affecting	150.04752769217922
Mercds came again and she found him so altered that she was even more anxious than before to have him taken to her own home	110.8974202553096
Morrels wish also who would fain have conveyed the old man against his consent but the old man resisted and cried so that they were actually frightened	183.83005323614333
Mercds remained therefore by his bedside and M	248.6792677711121
Morrel went away making a sign to the Catalan that he had left his purse on the chimneypiece but availing himself of the doctors order the old man would not take any sustenance at length after nine days of despair and fasting the old man died cursing those who had caused his misery and saying to Mercds If you ever see my Edmond again tell him I die blessing him	123.24260652149825
The abb rose from his chair made two turns round the chamber and pressed his trembling hand against his parched throat	178.14496646507098
Of hunger sir of hunger said Caderousse	44.28987019648663
I am as certain of it as that we two are Christians	282.4345629677477
The abb with a shaking hand seized a glass of water that was standing by him halffull swallowed it at one gulp and then resumed his seat with red eyes and pale cheeks	96.64957387266494
This was indeed a horrid event said he in a hoarse voice	17.879300753356787
The more so sir as it was mens and not Gods doing	366.9691671147018
Tell me of those men said the abb and remember too he added in an almost menacing tone you have promised to tell me everything	47.846872656106925
Tell me therefore who are these men who killed the son with despair and the father with famine	153.56374734710977
Two men jealous of him sir one from love and the other from ambitionFernand and Danglars	258.5310274810342
How was this jealousy manifested Speak on	2247.2414593922176
They denounced Edmond as a Bonapartist agent	449.8229475279148
Which of the two denounced him Which was the real delinquent	931.6010682592241
Both sir one with a letter and the other put it in the post	65.55688532248018
And where was this letter written	2664.6598379983334
At La Rserve the day before the betrothal feast	327.8218550400118
Twas so thentwas so then murmured the abb	105.28358687148135
Oh Faria Faria how well did you judge men and things	289.6115658269874
What did you please to say sir asked Caderousse	55.61926774225198
Nothing nothing replied the priest go on	242.44557546200897
It was Danglars who wrote the denunciation with his left hand that his writing might not be recognized and Fernand who put it in the post	79.84632586037168
But exclaimed the abb suddenly you were there yourself	84.55124860790733
I said Caderousse astonished who told you I was there	35.87593471779955
The abb saw he had overshot the mark and he added quicklyNo one but in order to have known everything so well you must have been an eyewitness	217.36780085317073
True true said Caderousse in a choking voice I was there	45.12161581667089
And did you not remonstrate against such infamy asked the abb if not you were an accomplice	179.69601829899108
Sir replied Caderousse they had made me drink to such an excess that I nearly lost all perception	230.9962725416305
I had only an indistinct understanding of what was passing around me	79.05884856610554
I said all that a man in such a state could say but they both assured me that it was a jest they were carrying on and perfectly harmless	182.79795811697937
Next daynext day sir you must have seen plain enough what they had been doing yet you said nothing though you were present when Dants was arrested	168.22795340877914
Yes sir I was there and very anxious to speak but Danglars restrained me	192.34857082999068
If he should really be guilty said he and did really put in to the Island of Elba if he is really charged with a letter for the Bonapartist committee at Paris and if they find this letter upon him those who have supported him will pass for his accomplices	95.0661523576179
I confess I had my fears in the state in which politics then were and I held my tongue	215.48801398198268
It was cowardly I confess but it was not criminal	75.18654205050082
I understandyou allowed matters to take their course that was all	83.22174814058052
Yes sir answered Caderousse and remorse preys on me night and day	685.0709097968623
I often ask pardon of God I swear to you because this action the only one with which I have seriously to reproach myself in all my life is no doubt the cause of my abject condition	70.15924211547276
I am expiating a moment of selfishness and so I always say to La Carconte when she complains Hold your tongue woman it is the will of God	188.46108782003637
And Caderousse bowed his head with every sign of real repentance	215.72042146637423
Well sir said the abb you have spoken unreservedly and thus to accuse yourself is to deserve pardon	245.00692141106808
Unfortunately Edmond is dead and has not pardoned me	107.20257378325873
He did not know said the abb	20.69541367530313
But he knows it all now interrupted Caderousse they say the dead know everything	511.6823312155523
There was a brief silence the abb rose and paced up and down pensively and then resumed his seat	85.3916196139565
You have two or three times mentioned a M	254.5340785630074
Morrel he said who was he	119.69164194380944
The owner of the Pharaon and patron of Dants	548.7395346872386
And what part did he play in this sad drama inquired the abb	391.7621186600073
The part of an honest man full of courage and real regard	175.24564331883082
Twenty times he interceded for Edmond	3139.5180181068013
When the emperor returned he wrote implored threatened and so energetically that on the second restoration he was persecuted as a Bonapartist	340.3208713415753
Ten times as I told you he came to see Dants father and offered to receive him in his own house and the night or two before his death as I have already said he left his purse on the mantelpiece with which they paid the old mans debts and buried him decently and so Edmonds father died as he had lived without doing harm to anyone	114.83440532978923
I have the purse still by mea large one made of red silk	446.33487450714074
And asked the abb is M	1363.7346647556742
In that case replied the abb he should be a man blessed of God rich happy	180.71836616675284
Yes happy as myself said he	12.815499861055892
He is reduced almost to the last extremitynay he is almost at the point of dishonor	144.8099778040357
Yes continued Caderousse so it is after fiveandtwenty years of labor after having acquired a most honorable name in the trade of Marseilles M	193.4782685234229
Morrel is utterly ruined he has lost five ships in two years has suffered by the bankruptcy of three large houses and his only hope now is in that very Pharaon which poor Dants commanded and which is expected from the Indies with a cargo of cochineal and indigo	216.9906182987338
If this ship founders like the others he is a ruined man	62.3256342000408
And has the unfortunate man wife or children inquired the abb	331.75293159182104
Yes he has a wife who through everything has behaved like an angel he has a daughter who was about to marry the man she loved but whose family now will not allow him to we d the daughter of a ruined man he has besides a son a lieutenant in the army and as you may suppose all this instead of lessening only augments his sorrows	116.70272907992329
If he were alone in the world he would blow out his brains and there would be an end	55.43702748539258
And it is thus heaven recompenses virtue sir added Caderousse	3718.048908877434
You see I who never did a bad action but that I have told you ofam in destitution with my poor wife dying of fever before my very eyes and I unable to do anything in the world for her I shall die of hunger as old Dants did while Fernand and Danglars are rolling in wealth	149.69107128358348
Because their deeds have brought them good fortune while honest men have been reduced to misery	314.41601934275093
What has become of Danglars the instigator and therefore the most guilty	296.9214474248582
What has become of him Why he left Marseilles and was taken on the recommendation of M	76.9447365565142
Morrel who did not know his crime as cashier into a Spanish bank	452.109812969684
During the war with Spain he was employed in the commissariat of the French army and made a fortune then with that money he speculated in the funds and trebled or quadrupled his capital and having first married his bankers daughter who left him a widower he has married a second time a widow a Madame de Nargonne daughter of M	171.00168268897383
de Servieux the kings chamberlain who is in high favor at court	123.20547650637174
He is a millionaire and they have made him a baron and now he is the Baron Danglars with a fine residence in the Rue du MontBlanc with ten horses in his stables six footmen in his antechamber and I know not how many millions in his strongbox	83.20154471963572
Ah said the abb in a peculiar tone he is happy	45.95501460385569
Happy Who can answer for that Happiness or unhappiness is the secret known but to ones self and the wallswalls have ears but no tongue but if a large fortune produces happiness Danglars is happy	408.04853768405405
Fernand Why much the same story	116.36180322363718
But how could a poor Catalan fisherboy without education or resources make a fortune I confess this staggers me	752.3708536799624
There must have been in his life some strange secret that no one knows	76.22347304619495
But then by what visible steps has he attained this high fortune or high position	539.1549667398638
Both sirhe has both fortune and positionboth	1197.1668935550463
It would seem so but listen and you will understand	98.31294417272456
Some days before the return of the emperor Fernand was drafted	179.558503382534
The Bourbons left him quietly enough at the Catalans but Napoleon returned a special levy was made and Fernand was compelled to join	411.9615577475037
I went too but as I was older than Fernand and had just married my poor wife I was only sent to the coast	112.5598225290948
Fernand was enrolled in the active army went to the frontier with his regiment and was at the battle of Ligny	157.65246949969313
The night after that battle he was sentry at the door of a general who carried on a secret correspondence with the enemy	92.86004525371821
That same night the general was to go over to the English	90.19626662921135
He proposed to Fernand to accompany him Fernand agreed to do so deserted his post and followed the general	218.76685933199477
Fernand would have been courtmartialed if Napoleon had remained on the throne but his action was rewarded by the Bourbons	187.6765107040149
He returned to France with the epaulet of sublieutenant and as the protection of the general who is in the highest favor was accorded to him he was a captain in 1823 during the Spanish warthat is to say at the time when Danglars made his early speculations	116.36744174480093
Fernand was a Spaniard and being sent to Spain to ascertain the feeling of his fellowcountrymen found Danglars there got on very intimate terms with him won over the support of the royalists at the capital and in the provinces received promises and made pledges on his own part guided his regiment by paths known to himself alone through the mountain gorges which were held by the royalists and in fact rendered such services in this brief campaign that after the taking of Trocadero he was made colonel and received the title of count and the cross of an officer of the Legion of Honor	204.82229717370032
Yes but listen this was not all	73.26342749115432
The war with Spain being ended Fernands career was checked by the long peace which seemed likely to endure throughout Europe	779.1201473194502
Greece only had risen against Turkey and had begun her war of independence all eyes were turned towards Athensit was the fashion to pity and support the Greeks	429.33917953896037
The French government without protecting them openly as you know gave countenance to volunteer assistance	714.0201909474939
Fernand sought and obtained leave to go and serve in Greece still having his name kept on the army roll	214.12514843739896
Some time after it was stated that the Comte de Morcerf this was the name he bore had entered the service of Ali Pasha with the rank of instructorgeneral	64.42972129249017
Ali Pasha was killed as you know but before he died he recompensed the services of Fernand by leaving him a considerable sum with which he returned to France when he was gazetted lieutenantgeneral	134.17549028237676
So that now inquired the abb	61.66711653859126
So that now continued Caderousse he owns a magnificent houseNo	1174.9260353065488
The abb opened his mouth hesitated for a moment then making an effort at selfcontrol he said And Mercdsthey tell me that she has disappeared	122.36310402842686
Disappeared said Caderousse yes as the sun disappears to rise the next day with still more splendor	211.7370110937501
Has she made a fortune also inquired the abb with an ironical smile	74.26035505924554
Mercds is at this moment one of the greatest ladies in Paris replied Caderousse	75.9902158329856
Go on said the abb it seems as if I were listening to the story of a dream	47.340293442736375
But I have seen things so extraordinary that what you tell me seems less astonishing than it otherwise might	234.45478441744447
Mercds was at first in the deepest despair at the blow which deprived her of Edmond	180.09171352445287
I have told you of her attempts to propitiate M	664.7556768869002
de Villefort her devotion to the elder Dants	341.08599975796204
In the midst of her despair a new affliction overtook her	1274.9456712514557
This was the departure of Fernandof Fernand whose crime she did not know and whom she regarded as her brother	216.33103321634303
Fernand went and Mercds remained alone	80.08859115495834
Three months passed and still she weptno news of Edmond no news of Fernand no companionship save that of an old man who was dying with despair	255.1341431872944
One evening after a day of accustomed vigil at the angle of two roads leading to Marseilles from the Catalans she returned to her home more depressed than ever	175.1718309174602
Suddenly she heard a step she knew turned anxiously around the door opened and Fernand dressed in the uniform of a sublieutenant stood before her	115.97602243588129
It was not the one she wished for most but it seemed as if a part of her past life had returned to her	74.6997738307848
Mercds seized Fernands hands with a transport which he took for love but which was only joy at being no longer alone in the world and seeing at last a friend after long hours of solitary sorrow	125.37771662587474
And then it must be confessed Fernand had never been hatedhe was only not precisely loved	399.58405137923893
Another possessed all Mercds heart that other was absent had disappeared perhaps was dead	458.44018107366367
At this last thought Mercds burst into a flood of tears and wrung her hands in agony but the thought which she had always repelled before when it was suggested to her by another came now in full force upon her mind and then too old Dants incessantly said to her Our Edmond is dead if he were not he would return to us	129.45565716832536
The old man died as I have told you had he lived Mercds perchance had not become the wife of another for he would have been there to reproach her infidelity	109.16321402942187
Fernand saw this and when he learned of the old mans death he returned	54.99490805102373
At his first coming he had not said a word of love to Mercds at the second he reminded her that he loved her	133.30340105645223
Mercds begged for six months more in which to await and mourn for Edmond	800.9146220174807
So that said the abb with a bitter smile that makes eighteen months in all	65.81959073347784
What more could the most devoted lover desire Then he murmured the words of the English poet Frailty thy name is woman	583.5755861389613
Six months afterwards continued Caderousse the marriage took place in the church of Accoules	117.02902707819094
The very church in which she was to have married Edmond murmured the priest there was only a change of bridegrooms	132.2266306551295
Well Mercds was married proceeded Caderousse but although in the eyes of the world she appeared calm she nearly fainted as she passed La Rserve where eighteen months before the betrothal had been celebrated with him whom she might have known she still loved had she looked to the bottom of her heart	93.82668794827235
Fernand more happy but not more at his easefor I saw at this time he was in constant dread of Edmonds returnFernand was very anxious to get his wife away and to depart himself	159.2420351036751
There were too many unpleasant possibilities associated with the Catalans and eight days after the wedding they left Marseilles	311.471854255677
Did you ever see Mercds again inquired the priest	90.7806689209354
Yes during the Spanish war at Perpignan where Fernand had left her she was attending to the education of her son	133.76887299201894
But then to be able to instruct her child continued the abb she must have received an education herself	220.64271436150426
I understood from Edmond that she was the daughter of a simple fisherman beautiful but uneducated	283.65612293095313
Oh replied Caderousse did he know so little of his lovely betrothed Mercds might have been a queen sir if the crown were to be placed on the heads of the loveliest and most intelligent	115.98947748065822
Fernands fortune was already waxing great and she developed with his growing fortune	567.7738419531411
Besides I believe between ourselves she did this in order to distract her mind that she might forget and she only filled her head in order to alleviate the weight on her heart	110.41970556925617
But now her position in life is assured continued Caderousse no doubt fortune and honors have comforted her she is rich a countess and yet	600.0384904916373
And yet what asked the abb	54.66090300236647
Yet I am sure she is not happy said Caderousse	29.934407167243545
Why when I found myself utterly destitute I thought my old friends would perhaps assist me	285.14781094521544
So I went to Danglars who would not even receive me	52.11809139591711
I called on Fernand who sent me a hundred francs by his valetdechambre	75.15841893486848
Then you did not see either of them	83.37478813809182
No but Madame de Morcerf saw me	87.8698743386691
As I went away a purse fell at my feetit contained fiveandtwenty louis I raised my head quickly and saw Mercds who at once shut the blind	339.32598276119046
Oh he never was a friend of mine I did not know him and I had nothing to ask of him	27.80128748115095
Do you not know what became of him and the share he had in Edmonds misfortunes	244.65084907444978
No I only know that some time after Edmonds arrest he married Mademoiselle de SaintMran and soon after left Marseilles no doubt he has been as lucky as the rest no doubt he is as rich as Danglars as high in station as Fernand	146.31368158318753
I only as you see have remained poor wretched and forgotten	878.8661065739104
You are mistaken my friend replied the abb God may seem sometimes to forget for a time while his justice reposes but there always comes a moment when he remembersand beholda proof	384.0682374532945
As he spoke the abb took the diamond from his pocket and giving it to Caderousse said Here my friend take this diamond it is yours	79.40696753237093
What for me only cried Caderousse ah sir do not jest with me	93.01094443547537
This diamond was to have been shared among his friends	194.42908617344435
Edmond had one friend only and thus it can not be divided	75.88616684148799
Take the diamond then and sell it it is worth fifty thousand francs and I repeat my wish that this sum may suffice to release you from your wretchedness	77.37870420914334
Oh sir said Caderousse putting out one hand timidly and with the other wiping away the perspiration which bedewed his browOh sir do not make a jest of the happiness or despair of a man	112.62121175467303
I know what happiness and what despair are and I never make a jest of such feelings	215.5730298546263
Take it then but in exchange	1319.041890578774
Caderousse who touched the diamond withdrew his hand	55.419577211658236
In exchange he continued give me the red silk purse that M	188.0957894020654
Morrel left on old Dants chimneypiece and which you tell me is still in your hands	81.8916544157197
Caderousse more and more astonished went toward a large oaken cupboard opened it and gave the abb a long purse of faded red silk round which were two copper runners that had once been gilt	197.59229908161146
The abb took it and in return gave Caderousse the diamond	669.1399872664277
Oh you are a man of God sir cried Caderousse for no one knew that Edmond had given you this diamond and you might have kept it	68.93316690307064
Which said the abb to himself you would have done	28.734512776954144
The abb rose took his hat and gloves	6.460642529764125
Well he said all you have told me is perfectly true then and I may believe it in every particular	77.54943337153348
See sir replied Caderousse in this corner is a crucifix in holy woodhere on this shelf is my wifes testament open this book and I will swear upon it with my hand on the crucifix	303.33301001133685
I will swear to you by my souls salvation my faith as a Christian I have told everything to you as it occurred and as the recording angel will tell it to the ear of God at the day of the last judgment	140.12955018394436
Tis well said the abb convinced by his manner and tone that Caderousse spoke the truth	144.57933081468786
Tis well and may this money profit you Adieu I go far from men who thus so bitterly injure each other	390.7307177075367
The abb with difficulty got away from the enthusiastic thanks of Caderousse opened the door himself got out and mounted his horse once more saluted the innkeeper who kept uttering his loud farewells and then returned by the road he had travelled in coming	120.00754478990935
When Caderousse turned around he saw behind him La Carconte paler and trembling more than ever	112.98826029366114
Is then all that I have heard really true she inquired	395.8642513874614
What That he has given the diamond to us only inquired Caderousse half bewildered with joy yes nothing more true See here it is	218.8603605645826
The woman gazed at it a moment and then said in a gloomy voice Suppose its false	150.0899580681628
False Why should that man give me a false diamond	95.57608193519502
To get your secret without paying for it you blockhead	492.4674033090945
Caderousse remained for a moment aghast under the weight of such an idea	99.13304893785437
Oh he said taking up his hat which he placed on the red handkerchief tied round his head we will soon find out	32.5170289301542
Why the fair is on at Beaucaire there are always jewellers from Paris there and I will show it to them	134.2873952267392
Look after the house wife and I shall be back in two hours and Caderousse left the house in haste and ran rapidly in the direction opposite to that which the priest had taken	64.57748024590457
Fifty thousand francs muttered La Carconte when left alone it is a large sum of money but it is not a fortune	27.614880664328666
The day after that in which the scene we have just described had taken place on the road between Bellegarde and Beaucaire a man of about thirty or twoandthirty dressed in a bright blue frock coat nankeen trousers and a white waistcoat having the appearance and accent of an Englishman presented himself before the mayor of Marseilles	120.5573345476395
Sir said he I am chief clerk of the house of Thomson   French of Rome	42.2299069815953
We are and have been these ten years connected with the house of Morrel   Son of Marseilles	79.34568421886365
We have a hundred thousand francs or thereabouts loaned on their securities and we are a little uneasy at reports that have reached us that the firm is on the brink of ruin	251.74435619311444
I have come therefore express from Rome to ask you for information	79.63953710588949
I know very well that during the last four or five years misfortune has seemed to pursue M	66.85547372487135
He has lost four or five vessels and suffered by three or four bankruptcies but it is not for me although I am a creditor myself to the amount of ten thousand francs to give any information as to the state of his finances	68.58624416488696
Ask of me as mayor what is my opinion of M	64.15898082415104
Morrel and I shall say that he is a man honorable to the last degree and who has up to this time fulfilled every engagement with scrupulous punctuality	195.929082041847
This is all I can say sir if you wish to learn more address yourself to M	90.12093276275999
de Boville the inspector of prisons No	574.980303203354
15 Rue de Nouailles he has I believe two hundred thousand francs in Morrels hands and if there be any grounds for apprehension as this is a greater amount than mine you will most probably find him better informed than myself	157.7937309895812
The Englishman seemed to appreciate this extreme delicacy made his bow and went away proceeding with a characteristic British stride towards the street mentioned	347.0650018678947
de Boville was in his private room and the Englishman on perceiving him made a gesture of surprise which seemed to indicate that it was not the first time he had been in his presence	34.354745055504914
de Boville he was in such a state of despair that it was evident all the faculties of his mind absorbed in the thought which occupied him at the moment did not allow either his memory or his imagination to stray to the past	76.78611992621457
The Englishman with the coolness of his nation addressed him in terms nearly similar to those with which he had accosted the mayor of Marseilles	184.83651722223192
de Boville your fears are unfortunately but too well founded and you see before you a man in despair	166.10018216923586
I had two hundred thousand francs placed in the hands of Morrel   Son these two hundred thousand francs were the dowry of my daughter who was to be married in a fortnight and these two hundred thousand francs were payable half on the 15th of this month and the other half on the 15th of next month	40.86256967574502
Morrel of my desire to have these payments punctually and he has been here within the last halfhour to tell me that if his ship the Pharaon did not come into port on the 15th he would be wholly unable to make this payment	140.29173034492615
But said the Englishman this looks very much like a suspension of payment	279.94011206194256
It looks more like bankruptcy exclaimed M	196.40596990321117
The Englishman appeared to reflect a moment and then said From which it would appear sir that this credit inspires you with considerable apprehension	247.3085762696029
To tell you the truth I consider it lost	131.57522867322754
Well then I will buy it of you	21.794657699711948
But at a tremendous discount of course	88.67943104295277
No for two hundred thousand francs	1.1614712421743976
Our house added the Englishman with a laugh does not do things in that way	49.29591487965257
And the Englishman drew from his pocket a bundle of banknotes which might have been twice the sum M	45.36474663828258
A ray of joy passed across M	54.077776816315385
de Bovilles countenance yet he made an effort at selfcontrol and said	101.62942631081259
Sir I ought to tell you that in all probability you will not realize six per cent of this sum	35.47265925157985
That s no affair of mine replied the Englishman that is the affair of the house of Thomson   French in whose name I act	37.97172946604489
They have perhaps some motive to serve in hastening the ruin of a rival firm	254.50366321378388
But all I know sir is that I am ready to hand you over this sum in exchange for your assignment of the debt	90.45519182075319
Of course that is perfectly just cried M	391.4359615150831
The commission is usually one and a half will you have twothreefive per cent or even more Whatever you say	207.98668929933874
Sir replied the Englishman laughing I am like my house and do not do such thingsno the commission I ask is quite different	122.59726651609543
You are the inspector of prisons	1479.1769038126001
I have been so these fourteen years	154.82378328083848
You keep the registers of entries and departures	3817.4443794849776
To these registers there are added notes relative to the prisoners	596.458898126018
There are special reports on every prisoner	1237.0323497564277
Well sir I was educated at Rome by a poor devil of an abb who disappeared suddenly	94.9481655435557
I have since learned that he was confined in the Chteau dIf and I should like to learn some particulars of his death	53.90445396040255
Oh I recollect him perfectly cried M	112.15985889048369
Very possibly but what sort of madness was it	66.07793852227226
He pretended to know of an immense treasure and offered vast sums to the government if they would liberate him	370.2055703468172
Yes sir five or six months ago last February	276.5471990908074
You have a good memory sir to recollect dates so well	499.2912743733845
I recollect this because the poor devils death was accompanied by a singular incident	182.6225658337357
May I ask what that was said the Englishman with an expression of curiosity which a close observer would have been astonished at discovering in his phlegmatic countenance	95.05434587488531
Oh dear yes sir the abbs dungeon was forty or fifty feet distant from that of one of Bonapartes emissariesone of those who had contributed the most to the return of the usurper in 1815 a very resolute and very dangerous man	188.32726799584643
de Boville I myself had occasion to see this man in 1816 or 1817 and we could only go into his dungeon with a file of soldiers	158.75810832371695
That man made a deep impression on me I shall never forget his countenance	44.99105439011277
And you say sir he interposed that the two dungeons	464.92711682350233
Were separated by a distance of fifty feet but it appears that this Edmond Dants	106.15495705591549
It appears sir that this Edmond Dants had procured tools or made them for they found a tunnel through which the prisoners held communication with one another	307.18889614297956
This tunnel was dug no doubt with an intention of escape	89.44135176008182
No doubt but unfortunately for the prisoners the Abb Faria had an attack of catalepsy and died	150.34544770285086
That must have cut short the projects of escape	128.5040394574574
For the dead man yes replied M	232.46075355016671
de Boville but not for the survivor on the contrary this Dants saw a means of accelerating his escape	238.846648502745
He no doubt thought that prisoners who died in the Chteau dIf were interred in an ordinary burialground and he conveyed the dead man into his own cell took his place in the sack in which they had sewed up the corpse and awaited the moment of interment	116.6992200817368
It was a bold step and one that showed some courage remarked the Englishman	514.8635095553926
As I have already told you sir he was a very dangerous man and fortunately by his own act disembarrassed the government of the fears it had on his account	104.07011747573688
The Chteau dIf has no cemetery and they simply throw the dead into the sea after fastening a thirtysixpound cannonball to their feet	488.9222871404228
Well observed the Englishman as if he were slow of comprehension	326.2732575606718
Well they fastened a thirtysixpound ball to his feet and threw him into the sea	27.873691026234184
Yes sir continued the inspector of prisons	76.079815766217
You may imagine the amazement of the fugitive when he found himself flung headlong over the rocks I should like to have seen his face at that moment	104.38966334816908
No matter replied De Boville in supreme goodhumor at the certainty of recovering his two hundred thousand francsno matter I can fancy it	318.41119857978197
So can I said the Englishman and he laughed too but he laughed as the English do at the end of his teeth	124.4372413937334
And so continued the Englishman who first gained his composure he was drowned	335.1702160340354
So that the governor got rid of the dangerous and the crazy prisoner at the same time	50.9770279571032
But some official document was drawn up as to this affair I suppose inquired the Englishman	115.9441776616805
You understand Dants relations if he had any might have some interest in knowing if he were dead or alive	63.95079937693532
So that now if there were anything to inherit from him they may do so with easy conscience	110.55841890090736
He is dead and no mistake about it	191.96402914765514
Oh yes and they may have the fact attested whenever they please	498.76172112089597
So be it said the Englishman	418.3593338103038
But to return to these registers	52027.89090268051
True this story has diverted our attention from them	87.68515526525967
Excuse you for what For the story By no means it really seems to me very curious	127.94017326475613
So sir you wish to see all relating to the poor abb who really was gentleness itself	180.11273528068156
Yes you will much oblige me	1.8380010208198758
Go into my study here and I will show it to you	16.592827712852127
Everything was here arranged in perfect order each register had its number each file of papers its place	905.8343398027623
The inspector begged the Englishman to seat himself in an armchair and placed before him the register and documents relative to the Chteau dIf giving him all the time he desired for the examination while De Boville seated himself in a corner and began to read his newspaper	91.94309162280186
The Englishman easily found the entries relative to the Abb Faria but it seemed that the history which the inspector had related interested him greatly for after having perused the first documents he turned over the leaves until he reached the deposition respecting Edmond Dants	225.50434125086582
There he found everything arranged in due orderthe accusation examination Morrels petition M	5393.210377060862
He folded up the accusation quietly and put it as quietly in his pocket read the examination and saw that the name of Noirtier was not mentioned in it perused too the application dated 10th April 1815 in which Morrel by the deputy procureurs advice exaggerated with the best intentions for Napoleon was then on the throne the services Dants had rendered to the imperial causeservices which Villeforts certificates rendered indisputable	413.15684203723293
Then he saw through the whole thing	930.0560880200376
This petition to Napoleon kept back by Villefort had become under the second restoration a terrible weapon against him in the hands of the kings attorney	65.92445933316277
He was no longer astonished when he searched on to find in the register this note placed in a bracket against his name	320.87016957791985
An inveterate Bonapartist took an active part in the return from the Island of Elba	56.251856154868854
To be kept in strict solitary confinement and to be closely watched and guarded	989.1272961740374
Beneath these lines was written in another hand See note abovenothing can be done	2652.388546322886
He compared the writing in the bracket with the writing of the certificate placed beneath Morrels petition and discovered that the note in the bracket was the same writing as the certificatethat is to say was in Villeforts handwriting	381.47030928185853
As to the note which accompanied this the Englishman understood that it might have been added by some inspector who had taken a momentary interest in Dants situation but who had from the remarks we have quoted found it impossible to give any effect to the interest he had felt	138.55054094924498
As we have said the inspector from discretion and that he might not disturb the Abb Farias pupil in his researches had seated himself in a corner and was reading Le Drapeau Blanc	216.52478254473328
He did not see the Englishman fold up and place in his pocket the accusation written by Danglars under the arbor of La Rserve and which had the postmark Marseilles 27th February delivery 6 oclock P	402.69379736194884
But it must be said that if he had seen it he attached so little importance to this scrap of paper and so much importance to his two hundred thousand francs that he would not have opposed whatever the Englishman might do however irregular it might be	103.34959961137565
Thanks said the latter closing the register with a slam I have all I want now it is for me to perform my promise	79.40694122198072
Give me a simple assignment of your debt acknowledge therein the receipt of the cash and I will hand you over the money	137.4027271931522
He rose gave his seat to M	21.025354590516194
de Boville who took it without ceremony and quickly drew up the required assignment while the Englishman counted out the banknotes on the other side of the desk	135.6651076362355
Anyone who had quitted Marseilles a few years previously well acquainted with the interior of Morrels warehouse and had returned at this date would have found a great change	152.43015322515998
Instead of that air of life of comfort and of happiness that permeates a flourishing and prosperous business establishmentinstead of merry faces at the windows busy clerks hurrying to and fro in the long corridorsinstead of the court filled with bales of goods reechoing with the cries and the jokes of porters one would have immediately perceived all aspect of sadness and gloom	428.4315841488879
Out of all the numerous clerks that used to fill the deserted corridor and the empty office but two remained	429.9217735039165
One was a young man of three or fourandtwenty who was in love with M	96.6904007947282
Morrels daughter and had remained with him in spite of the efforts of his friends to induce him to withdraw the other was an old oneeyed cashier called Cocles or Cockeye a nickname given him by the young men who used to throng this vast now almost deserted beehive and which had so completely replaced his real name that he would not in all probability have replied to anyone who addressed him by it	162.0477555190017
Morrels service and a most singular change had taken place in his position he had at the same time risen to the rank of cashier and sunk to the rank of a servant	55.22920849443344
He was however the same Cocles good patient devoted but inflexible on the subject of arithmetic the only point on which he would have stood firm against the world even against M	258.68379722682795
Morrel and strong in the multiplicationtable which he had at his fingers ends no matter what scheme or what trap was laid to catch him	358.2819449447201
In the midst of the disasters that befell the house Cocles was the only one unmoved	583.8469246429929
But this did not arise from a want of affection on the contrary from a firm conviction	66.7205714657592
Like the rats that one by one forsake the doomed ship even before the vessel weighs anchor so all the numerous clerks had by degrees deserted the office and the warehouse	521.2739660676765
Cocles had seen them go without thinking of inquiring the cause of their departure	160.97917936984453
Everything was as we have said a question of arithmetic to Cocles and during twenty years he had always seen all payments made with such exactitude that it seemed as impossible to him that the house should stop payment as it would to a miller that the river that had so long turned his mill should cease to flow	188.07030443770697
Nothing had as yet occurred to shake Cocles belief the last months payment had been made with the most scrupulous exactitude Cocles had detected an overbalance of fourteen sous in his cash and the same evening he had brought them to M	270.3487130080941
Morrel who with a melancholy smile threw them into an almost empty drawer saying	135.19867558338333
Thanks Cocles you are the pearl of cashiers	1268.9423184770703
Cocles went away perfectly happy for this eulogium of M	239.65894776800585
Morrel himself the pearl of the honest men of Marseilles flattered him more than a present of fifty crowns	182.7189435218608
But since the end of the month M	17.763864170723725
Morrel had passed many an anxious hour	5059.8316812941775
In order to meet the payments then due he had collected all his resources and fearing lest the report of his distress should get bruited abroad at Marseilles when he was known to be reduced to such an extremity he went to the Beaucaire fair to sell his wifes and daughters jewels and a portion of his plate	206.18746200632862
By this means the end of the month was passed but his resources were now exhausted	65.89055138463308
Credit owing to the reports afloat was no longer to be had and to meet the one hundred thousand francs due on the 15th of the present month and the one hundred thousand francs due on the 15th of the next month to M	66.33462635607383
Morrel had in reality no hope but the return of the Pharaon of whose departure he had learnt from a vessel which had weighed anchor at the same time and which had already arrived in harbor	119.20199751686559
But this vessel which like the Pharaon came from Calcutta had been in for a fortnight while no intelligence had been received of the Pharaon	138.50968191403817
Such was the state of affairs when the day after his interview with M	69.94837624958771
de Boville the confidential clerk of the house of Thomson   French of Rome presented himself at M	18.383721333278636
Emmanuel received him this young man was alarmed by the appearance of every new face for every new face might be that of a new creditor come in anxiety to question the head of the house	90.3176349246682
The young man wishing to spare his employer the pain of this interview questioned the newcomer but the stranger declared that he had nothing to say to M	153.65045620233226
Emmanuel and that his business was with M	55.06132519492904
Cocles appeared and the young man bade him conduct the stranger to M	58.84798241328256
Cocles went first and the stranger followed him	153.65589472466658
On the staircase they met a beautiful girl of sixteen or seventeen who looked with anxiety at the stranger	122.88058332634095
Morrel is in his room is he not Mademoiselle Julie said the cashier	249.5910936856118
Yes I think so at least said the young girl hesitatingly	43.77962586231915
Go and see Cocles and if my father is there announce this gentleman	111.53363148268433
It will be useless to announce me mademoiselle returned the Englishman	481.6268484382253
Morrel does not know my name this worthy gentleman has only to announce the confidential clerk of the house of Thomson   French of Rome with whom your father does business	59.31060903185459
The young girl turned pale and continued to descend while the stranger and Cocles continued to mount the staircase	134.11414799788824
She entered the office where Emmanuel was while Cocles by the aid of a key he possessed opened a door in the corner of a landingplace on the second staircase conducted the stranger into an antechamber opened a second door which he closed behind him and after having left the clerk of the house of Thomson   French alone returned and signed to him that he could enter	66.2102178492167
The Englishman entered and found Morrel seated at a table turning over the formidable columns of his ledger which contained the list of his liabilities	143.82389795131974
At the sight of the stranger M	741.7286805734682
Morrel closed the ledger arose and offered a seat to the stranger and when he had seen him seated resumed his own chair	72.23554138037142
Fourteen years had changed the worthy merchant who in his thirtysixth year at the opening of this history was now in his fiftieth his hair had turned white time and sorrow had ploughed deep furrows on his brow and his look once so firm and penetrating was now irresolute and wandering as if he feared being forced to fix his attention on some particular thought or person	241.24538739021057
The Englishman looked at him with an air of curiosity evidently mingled with interest	48.85932666436201
Monsieur said Morrel whose uneasiness was increased by this examination you wish to speak to me	31.960098673323397
Yes monsieur you are aware from whom I come	115.93139462160123
The house of Thomson   French at least so my cashier tells me	245.18519729830922
The house of Thomson   French had 300000 or 400000 francs to pay this month in France and knowing your strict punctuality have collected all the bills bearing your signature and charged me as they became due to present them and to employ the money otherwise	208.5473752744418
Morrel sighed deeply and passed his hand over his forehead which was covered with perspiration	16.740242648747166
So then sir said Morrel you hold bills of mine	567.5560126070508
Yes and for a considerable sum	33.278773702076144
What is the amount asked Morrel with a voice he strove to render firm	54.986923357647235
Here is said the Englishman taking a quantity of papers from his pocket an assignment of 200000 francs to our house by M	71.68461653512097
de Boville the inspector of prisons to whom they are due	139.3362401647366
You acknowledge of course that you owe this sum to him	25.41822914441821
Yes he placed the money in my hands at four and a half per cent nearly five years ago	61.59440788832332
Half the 15th of this month half the 15th of next	239.44565707233423
Just so and now here are 32500 francs payable shortly they are all signed by you and assigned to our house by the holders	182.593334089513
I recognize them said Morrel whose face was suffused as he thought that for the first time in his life he would be unable to honor his own signature	42.11406351175997
No I have for the end of the month these bills which have been assigned to us by the house of Pascal and the house of Wild   Turner of Marseilles amounting to nearly 55000 francs in all 287500 francs	130.9999956010171
It is impossible to describe what Morrel suffered during this enumeration	498.67883075267537
Two hundred and eightyseven thousand five hundred francs repeated he	78.40547235722278
I will not continued he after a moments silence conceal from you that while your probity and exactitude up to this moment are universally acknowledged yet the report is current in Marseilles that you are not able to meet your liabilities	278.15257050319883
At this almost brutal speech Morrel turned deathly pale	435.91597224244487
Sir said he up to this timeand it is now more than fourandtwenty years since I received the direction of this house from my father who had himself conducted it for fiveandthirty yearsnever has anything bearing the signature of Morrel   Son been dishonored	205.0981469060662
I know that replied the Englishman	466.141746619062
But as a man of honor should answer another tell me fairly shall you pay these with the same punctuality	185.41037569078608
Morrel shuddered and looked at the man who spoke with more assurance than he had hitherto shown	63.77807632349887
To questions frankly put said he a straightforward answer should be given	203.97019622146001
Yes I shall pay if as I hope my vessel arrives safely for its arrival will again procure me the credit which the numerous accidents of which I have been the victim have deprived me but if the Pharaon should be lost and this last resource be gone	139.1420902092117
The poor mans eyes filled with tears	3.836513020672118
Well said the other if this last resource fail you	331.5210924361729
Well returned Morrel it is a cruel thing to be forced to say but already used to misfortune I must habituate myself to shame	125.29677731760724
I fear I shall be forced to suspend payment	1380.9392061506296
Have you no friends who could assist you	220.21120739321853
In business sir said he one has no friends only correspondents	544.862534785347
It is true murmured the Englishman then you have but one hope	133.75034197777896
As I was on my way here a vessel was coming into port	284.5882800777201
I know it sir a young man who still adheres to my fallen fortunes passes a part of his time in a belvedere at the top of the house in hopes of being the first to announce good news to me he has informed me of the arrival of this ship	104.41348521136773
No she is a Bordeaux vessel La Gironde she comes from India also but she is not mine	426.79533243620114
Perhaps she has spoken to the Pharaon and brings you some tidings of her	109.4512154976846
Shall I tell you plainly one thing sir I dread almost as much to receive any tidings of my vessel as to remain in doubt	214.9247691867224
Then in a low voice Morrel addedThis delay is not natural	362.01327282425194
The Pharaon left Calcutta the 5th of February she ought to have been here a month ago	38.22510386236168
What is that said the Englishman	343.47691741463984
What is the meaning of that noise	362.5521082944454
Oh my God cried Morrel turning pale what is it	44.656135182542144
A loud noise was heard on the stairs of people moving hastily and halfstifled sobs	440.475210433603
Morrel rose and advanced to the door but his strength failed him and he sank into a chair	51.380547305570154
The two men remained opposite one another Morrel trembling in every limb the stranger gazing at him with an air of profound pity	87.88112728971196
The noise had ceased but it seemed that Morrel expected somethingsomething had occasioned the noise and something must follow	266.84337485532956
The stranger fancied he heard footsteps on the stairs and that the footsteps which were those of several persons stopped at the door	62.32896251255947
A key was inserted in the lock of the first door and the creaking of hinges was audible	59.85145904468645
There are only two persons who have the key to that door murmured Morrel Cocles and Julie	87.55891657527717
At this instant the second door opened and the young girl her eyes bathed with tears appeared	20.286258836513763
Morrel rose tremblingly supporting himself by the arm of the chair	23.503244647746477
He would have spoken but his voice failed him	167.7439832125755
Oh father said she clasping her hands forgive your child for being the bearer of evil tidings	133.2126333911207
Julie threw herself into his arms	1.6120407380807193
Oh father father murmured she courage	5076.848162631128
The Pharaon has gone down then said Morrel in a hoarse voice	9.238882641045302
The young girl did not speak but she made an affirmative sign with her head as she lay on her fathers breast	68.64745706194833
Saved said the girl saved by the crew of the vessel that has just entered the harbor	52.39324943747351
Morrel raised his two hands to heaven with an expression of resignation and sublime gratitude	34.119868481542696
Thanks my God said he at least thou strikest but me alone	578.8280225081877
A tear moistened the eye of the phlegmatic Englishman	208.16987351893013
Come in come in said Morrel for I presume you are all at the door	40.16817299368902
Scarcely had he uttered those words when Madame Morrel entered weeping bitterly	245.59566962788423
Emmanuel followed her and in the antechamber were visible the rough faces of seven or eight halfnaked sailors	541.1467991163678
At the sight of these men the Englishman started and advanced a step then restrained himself and retired into the farthest and most obscure corner of the apartment	153.432127933342
Madame Morrel sat down by her husband and took one of his hands in hers Julie still lay with her head on his shoulder Emmanuel stood in the centre of the chamber and seemed to form the link between Morrels family and the sailors at the door	83.2495676571389
How did this happen said Morrel	2.019084215842578
Draw nearer Penelon said the young man and tell us all about it	18.3725896407291
An old seaman bronzed by the tropical sun advanced twirling the remains of a hat between his hands	209.75708767095122
Morrel said he as if he had just quitted Marseilles the previous evening and had just returned from Aix or Toulon	105.44157241737406
Goodday Penelon returned Morrel who could not refrain from smiling through his tears where is the captain	132.5763270710135
Morrelhe has stayed behind sick at Palma but please God it wo nt be much and you will see him in a few days all alive and hearty	136.63239793901354
Well now tell your story Penelon	160289.59007813327
Penelon rolled his quid in his cheek placed his hand before his mouth turned his head and sent a long jet of tobaccojuice into the antechamber advanced his foot balanced himself and began	127.19659058082185
Morrel said he we were somewhere between Cape Blanc and Cape Boyador sailing with a fair breeze southsouthwest after a weeks calm when Captain Gaumard comes up to meI was at the helm I should tell youand says Penelon what do you think of those clouds coming up over there I was just then looking at them myself	509.11948128020504
What do I think captain Why I think that they are rising faster than they have any business to do and that they would not be so black if they did nt mean mischief	95.3974288905045
That s my opinion too said the captain and Ill take precautions accordingly	341.22890771660246
We are carrying too much canvas	178767.02337955212
Avast there all hands Take in the studdingsails and stow the flying jib	1077.8603097254033
It was time the squall was on us and the vessel began to heel	156.0187199184638
Ah said the captain we have still too much canvas set all hands lower the mainsail Five minutes after it was down and we sailed under mizzentopsails and topgallant sails	632.854159139195
Well Penelon said the captain what makes you shake your head Why I says I still think you ve got too much on	149.85669981565295
I think you re right answered he we shall have a gale	115.35388624061571
A gale More than that we shall have a tempest or I do nt know what s what	75.67065321888474
You could see the wind coming like the dust at Montredon luckily the captain understood his business	636.4219754458376
Take in two reefs in the topsails cried the captain let go the bowlins haul the brace lower the topgallant sails haul out the reeftackles on the yards	796.1231121403566
That was not enough for those latitudes said the Englishman I should have taken four reefs in the topsails and furled the spanker	250.21765977811702
His firm sonorous and unexpected voice made everyone start	317.5553282250793
Penelon put his hand over his eyes and then stared at the man who thus criticized the manuvres of his captain	95.82254471482304
We did better than that sir said the old sailor respectfully we put the helm up to run before the tempest ten minutes after we struck our topsails and scudded under bare poles	300.30883216621135
The vessel was very old to risk that said the Englishman	121.71048125427731
Eh it was that that did the business after pitching heavily for twelve hours we sprung a leak	1155.1768836233089
Penelon said the captain I think we are sinking give me the helm and go down into the hold	115.65190910168563
I gave him the helm and descended there was already three feet of water	110.43148619134223
All hands to the pumps I shouted but it was too late and it seemed the more we pumped the more came in	188.06076892586614
Ah said I after four hours work since we are sinking let us sink we can die but once	126.7131888014725
Is that the example you set Penelon cries the captain very well wait a minute	843.5616116702801
He went into his cabin and came back with a brace of pistols	68.85276811796851
I will blow the brains out of the first man who leaves the pump said he	59.207821467512666
There s nothing gives you so much courage as good reasons continued the sailor and during that time the wind had abated and the sea gone down but the water kept rising not much only two inches an hour but still it rose	194.217549591418
Two inches an hour does not seem much but in twelve hours that makes two feet and three we had before that makes five	129.63200785443655
Come said the captain we have done all in our power and M	26.09888289463136
Morrel will have nothing to reproach us with we have tried to save the ship let us now save ourselves	149.20555900872625
To the boats my lads as quick as you can	38.092667628488435
Now continued Penelon you see M	87.12104797850901
Morrel a sailor is attached to his ship but still more to his life so we did not wait to be told twice the more so that the ship was sinking under us and seemed to say Get alongsave yourselves	178.82090604017228
We soon launched the boat and all eight of us got into it	169.76925872116803
The captain descended last or rather he did not descend he would not quit the vessel so I took him round the waist and threw him into the boat and then I jumped after him	79.48280441103672
It was time for just as I jumped the deck burst with a noise like the broadside of a manofwar	198.75592673506264
Ten minutes after she pitched forward then the other way spun round and round and then goodbye to the Pharaon	219.8834075967511
As for us we were three days without anything to eat or drink so that we began to think of drawing lots who should feed the rest when we saw La Gironde we made signals of distress she perceived us made for us and took us all on board	217.55019610672488
Morrel that s the whole truth on the honor of a sailor is not it true you fellows there A general murmur of approbation showed that the narrator had faithfully detailed their misfortunes and sufferings	294.8441313466109
Morrel I know there was no one in fault but destiny	303.59508750924084
It was the will of God that this should happen blessed be his name	353.3717423329459
What wages are due to you	9.286096184947802
Oh do nt let us talk of that M	25.019917384726895
Yes but we will talk of it	7.638768615405262
Well then three months said Penelon	29364.825736876024
Cocles pay two hundred francs to each of these good fellows said Morrel	59.101322472588095
At another time added he I should have said Give them besides two hundred francs over as a present but times are changed and the little money that remains to me is not my own so do not think me mean on this account	121.1528035592291
Penelon turned to his companions and exchanged a few words with them	28.454579328205025
Morrel said he again turning his quid as for that	159.68505487170046
Well we all say that fifty francs will be enough for us at present and that we will wait for the rest	46.51084674636356
Thanks my friends thanks cried Morrel gratefully take ittake it and if you can find another employer enter his service you are free to do so	164.14390122813123
These last words produced a prodigious effect on the seaman	256.4212943928778
Penelon nearly swallowed his quid fortunately he recovered	1076.8445215324086
Morrel said he in a low voice you send us away you are then angry with us	66.7294974531687
Morrel I am not angry quite the contrary and I do not send you away but I have no more ships and therefore I do not want any sailors	76.26619809254356
No more ships returned Penelon well then you ll build some well wait for you	401.59639827069907
I have no money to build ships with Penelon said the poor owner mournfully so I can not accept your kind offer	616.3860986759711
No more money Then you must not pay us we can scud like the Pharaon under bare poles	334.0949539128119
Enough enough cried Morrel almost overpowered leave me I pray you we shall meet again in a happier time	149.05558419121522
Emmanuel go with them and see that my orders are executed	111.90086433082789
At least we shall see each other again M	78.40680099629236
Yes I hope so at least	9.032705340208585
He made a sign to Cocles who went first the seamen followed him and Emmanuel brought up the rear	165.22741597213172
Now said the owner to his wife and daughter leave me I wish to speak with this gentleman	30.1961142287288
And he glanced towards the clerk of Thomson   French who had remained motionless in the corner during this scene in which he had taken no part except the few words we have mentioned	64.68858824804221
The two women looked at this person whose presence they had entirely forgotten and retired but as she left the apartment Julie gave the stranger a supplicating glance to which he replied by a smile that an indifferent spectator would have been surprised to see on his stern features	138.35896068631033
The two men were left alone	17.681291361251457
Well sir said Morrel sinking into a chair you have heard all and I have nothing further to tell you	40.8992348409236
I see returned the Englishman that a fresh and unmerited misfortune has overwhelmed you and this only increases my desire to serve you	266.7062586117469
Let me see continued the stranger I am one of your largest creditors	207.92611287709022
Your bills at least are the first that will fall due	220.80614475771492
Do you wish for time to pay	23.36705799187381
A delay would save my honor and consequently my life	58.33551198471837
How long a delay do you wish for	9.907573812055555
I will give you three replied the stranger	85.61336974764072
But asked Morrel will the house of Thomson   French consent	49.24243104791497
Oh I take everything on myself	218.62724504338522
Today is the 5th of June	520.8408509552517
Well renew these bills up to the 5th of September and on the 5th of September at eleven oclock the hand of the clock pointed to eleven I shall come to receive the money	30.78026077781356
I shall expect you returned Morrel and I will pay youor I shall be dead	91.7861458448373
These last words were uttered in so low a tone that the stranger could not hear them	31.697054735318726
The bills were renewed the old ones destroyed and the poor shipowner found himself with three months before him to collect his resources	196.7940790326253
The Englishman received his thanks with the phlegm peculiar to his nation and Morrel overwhelming him with grateful blessings conducted him to the staircase	234.3265229415899
The stranger met Julie on the stairs she pretended to be descending but in reality she was waiting for him	52.42188439772108
Oh sirsaid she clasping her hands	2.7114391836135296
Mademoiselle said the stranger one day you will receive a letter signed Sinbad the Sailor	75.7863706615898
Do exactly what the letter bids you however strange it may appear	435.70866171378424
I swear to you I will	15.397016774601155
Continue to be the good sweet girl you are at present and I have great hopes that Heaven will reward you by giving you Emmanuel for a husband	132.1765055740827
Julie uttered a faint cry blushed like a rose and leaned against the baluster	223.87801804937152
The stranger waved his hand and continued to descend	77.58513257093072
In the court he found Penelon who with a rouleau of a hundred francs in either hand seemed unable to make up his mind to retain them	87.14233387866616
Come with me my friend said the Englishman I wish to speak to you	14.700534990382865
The extension provided for by the agent of Thomson   French at the moment when Morrel expected it least was to the poor shipowner so decided a stroke of good fortune that he almost dared to believe that fate was at length grown weary of wasting her spite upon him	130.75070916288124
The same day he told his wife Emmanuel and his daughter all that had occurred and a ray of hope if not of tranquillity returned to the family	59.001942826456464
Unfortunately however Morrel had not only engagements with the house of Thomson   French who had shown themselves so considerate towards him and as he had said in business he had correspondents and not friends	110.82830671405195
When he thought the matter over he could by no means account for this generous conduct on the part of Thomson   French towards him and could only attribute it to some such selfish argument as this We had better help a man who owes us nearly 300000 francs and have those 300000 francs at the end of three months than hasten his ruin and get only six or eight per cent of our money back again	147.40428891756312
Unfortunately whether through envy or stupidity all Morrels correspondents did not take this view and some even came to a contrary decision	480.15057981322025
The bills signed by Morrel were presented at his office with scrupulous exactitude and thanks to the delay granted by the Englishman were paid by Cocles with equal punctuality	256.15915165872195
Cocles thus remained in his accustomed tranquillity	2250.493877170715
It was Morrel alone who remembered with alarm that if he had to repay on the 15th the 50000 francs of M	124.21729928317494
de Boville and on the 30th the 32500 francs of bills for which as well as the debt due to the inspector of prisons he had time granted he must be a ruined man	141.697521368339
The opinion of all the commercial men was that under the reverses which had successively weighed down Morrel it was impossible for him to remain solvent	225.93161512226695
Great therefore was the astonishment when at the end of the month he cancelled all his obligations with his usual punctuality	62.392328965222205
Still confidence was not restored to all minds and the general opinion was that the complete ruin of the unfortunate shipowner had been postponed only until the end of the month	94.61093960389832
The month passed and Morrel made extraordinary efforts to get in all his resources	380.0465968083801
Formerly his paper at any date was taken with confidence and was even in request	275.919962755295
Morrel now tried to negotiate bills at ninety days only and none of the banks would give him credit	264.1233791376892
Fortunately Morrel had some funds coming in on which he could rely and as they reached him he found himself in a condition to meet his engagements when the end of July came	130.42857722731134
The agent of Thomson   French had not been again seen at Marseilles the day after or two days after his visit to Morrel he had disappeared and as in that city he had had no intercourse but with the mayor the inspector of prisons and M	91.02796053491117
Morrel his departure left no trace except in the memories of these three persons	144.74242548776252
As to the sailors of the Pharaon they must have found snug berths elsewhere for they also had disappeared	329.33776705448736
Captain Gaumard recovered from his illness had returned from Palma	991.0660720670868
He delayed presenting himself at Morrels but the owner hearing of his arrival went to see him	83.79993452649838
The worthy shipowner knew from Penelons recital of the captains brave conduct during the storm and tried to console him	302.61408662827904
He brought him also the amount of his wages which Captain Gaumard had not dared to apply for	184.05358825294564
As he descended the staircase Morrel met Penelon who was going up	65.21224114608346
Penelon had it would seem made good use of his money for he was newly clad	307.05410421504627
When he saw his employer the worthy tar seemed much embarrassed drew on one side into the corner of the landingplace passed his quid from one cheek to the other stared stupidly with his great eyes and only acknowledged the squeeze of the hand which Morrel as usual gave him by a slight pressure in return	215.3140499173157
Morrel attributed Penelons embarrassment to the elegance of his attire it was evident the good fellow had not gone to such an expense on his own account he was no doubt engaged on board some other vessel and thus his bashfulness arose from the fact of his not having if we may so express ourselves worn mourning for the Pharaon longer	166.46194343893438
Perhaps he had come to tell Captain Gaumard of his good luck and to offer him employment from his new master	375.12566234246754
Worthy fellows said Morrel   as he went away may your new master love you as I loved you and be more fortunate than I have been	61.997923378626076
August rolled by in unceasing efforts on the part of Morrel to renew his credit or revive the old	72.68203110210925
On the 20th of August it was known at Marseilles that he had left town in the mailcoach and then it was said that the bills would go to protest at the end of the month and that Morrel had gone away and left his chief clerk Emmanuel and his cashier Cocles to meet the creditors	76.06442030753487
But contrary to all expectation when the 31st of August came the house opened as usual and Cocles appeared behind the grating of the counter examined all bills presented with the usual scrutiny and from first to last paid all with the usual precision	199.51514279249062
There came in moreover two drafts which M	362.50197704873347
Morrel had fully anticipated and which Cocles paid as punctually as the bills which the shipowner had accepted	260.47730000130036
All this was incomprehensible and then with the tenacity peculiar to prophets of bad news the failure was put off until the end of September	157.4624468919861
On the 1st Morrel returned he was awaited by his family with extreme anxiety for from this journey to Paris they hoped great things	121.42593538450481
Morrel had thought of Danglars who was now immensely rich and had lain under great obligations to Morrel in former days since to him it was owing that Danglars entered the service of the Spanish banker with whom he had laid the foundations of his vast wealth	161.0278366548441
It was said at this moment that Danglars was worth from six to eight millions of francs and had unlimited credit	79.71343351290399
Danglars then without taking a crown from his pocket could save Morrel he had but to pass his word for a loan and Morrel was saved	93.22236225769753
Morrel had long thought of Danglars but had kept away from some instinctive motive and had delayed as long as possible availing himself of this last resource	138.00270246558574
And Morrel was right for he returned home crushed by the humiliation of a refusal	100.12061993980737
Yet on his arrival Morrel did not utter a complaint or say one harsh word	263.7441917891285
He embraced his weeping wife and daughter pressed Emmanuels hand with friendly warmth and then going to his private room on the second floor had sent for Cocles	124.19510666145266
Then said the two women to Emmanuel we are indeed ruined	299.86403815479486
It was agreed in a brief council held among them that Julie should write to her brother who was in garrison at Nmes to come to them as speedily as possible	223.57320060971935
The poor women felt instinctively that they required all their strength to support the blow that impended	198.19650670618012
Besides Maximilian Morrel though hardly twoandtwenty had great influence over his father	223.44090905809244
He was a strongminded upright young man	159.83382910441367
At the time when he decided on his profession his father had no desire to choose for him but had consulted young Maximilians taste	295.33538241803535
He had at once declared for a military life and had in consequence studied hard passed brilliantly through the Polytechnic School and left it as sublieutenant of the 53rd of the line	442.08219937447274
For a year he had held this rank and expected promotion on the first vacancy	423.52217886468094
In his regiment Maximilian Morrel was noted for his rigid observance not only of the obligations imposed on a soldier but also of the duties of a man and he thus gained the name of the stoic	159.28636727164576
We need hardly say that many of those who gave him this epithet repeated it because they had heard it and did not even know what it meant	110.15684618790486
This was the young man whom his mother and sister called to their aid to sustain them under the serious trial which they felt they would soon have to endure	145.39661571138365
They had not mistaken the gravity of this event for the moment after Morrel had entered his private office with Cocles Julie saw the latter leave it pale trembling and his features betraying the utmost consternation	137.39875274697286
She would have questioned him as he passed by her but the worthy creature hastened down the staircase with unusual precipitation and only raised his hands to heaven and exclaimed	108.97817705419412
Oh mademoiselle mademoiselle what a dreadful misfortune Who could ever have believed it	119.43995631236659
A moment afterwards Julie saw him go upstairs carrying two or three heavy ledgers a portfolio and a bag of money	139.99425268686542
Morrel examined the ledgers opened the portfolio and counted the money	143.1680307516828
All his funds amounted to 6000 or 8000 francs his bills receivable up to the 5th to 4000 or 5000 which making the best of everything gave him 14000 francs to meet debts amounting to 287500 francs	508.8844493158531
He had not even the means for making a possible settlement on account	423.0440545344367
However when Morrel went down to his dinner he appeared very calm	116.21326003631762
This calmness was more alarming to the two women than the deepest dejection would have been	163.40064971910851
After dinner Morrel usually went out and used to take his coffee at the club of the Phocens and read the Semaphore this day he did not leave the house but returned to his office	71.13158978311176
As to Cocles he seemed completely bewildered	993.0695530602574
For part of the day he went into the courtyard seated himself on a stone with his head bare and exposed to the blazing sun	119.67512532164254
Emmanuel tried to comfort the women but his eloquence faltered	2732.4399118765123
The young man was too well acquainted with the business of the house not to feel that a great catastrophe hung over the Morrel family	90.99849112269844
Night came the two women had watched hoping that when he left his room Morrel would come to them but they heard him pass before their door and trying to conceal the noise of his footsteps	66.76989021203295
They listened he went into his sleepingroom and fastened the door inside	138.46568408349682
Madame Morrel sent her daughter to bed and half an hour after Julie had retired she rose took off her shoes and went stealthily along the passage to see through the keyhole what her husband was doing	109.52177458795421
In the passage she saw a retreating shadow it was Julie who uneasy herself had anticipated her mother	254.328892088095
The young lady went towards Madame Morrel	151.2501673795885
They had understood each other without speaking	103.4896173790985
Madame Morrel looked again through the keyhole Morrel was writing but Madame Morrel remarked what her daughter had not observed that her husband was writing on stamped paper	174.40830960386032
The terrible idea that he was writing his will flashed across her she shuddered and yet had not strength to utter a word	146.627594070838
Morrel seemed as calm as ever went into his office as usual came to his breakfast punctually and then after dinner he placed his daughter beside him took her head in his arms and held her for a long time against his bosom	103.09197078476389
In the evening Julie told her mother that although he was apparently so calm she had noticed that her fathers heart beat violently	94.29591281070289
The next two days passed in much the same way	190.7367696431643
On the evening of the 4th of September M	59.428401040555485
Morrel asked his daughter for the key of his study	14.06256868710691
Julie trembled at this request which seemed to her of bad omen	250.3499309022257
Why did her father ask for this key which she always kept and which was only taken from her in childhood as a punishment The young girl looked at Morrel	88.85108047772276
What have I done wrong father she said that you should take this key from me	58.89163936435889
Nothing my dear replied the unhappy man the tears starting to his eyes at this simple questionnothing only I want it	186.28590986474643
Julie made a pretence to feel for the key	178.2755765377014
I must have left it in my room she said	30.68926973731763
And she went out but instead of going to her apartment she hastened to consult Emmanuel	102.46372810410747
Do not give this key to your father said he and tomorrow morning if possible do not quit him for a moment	45.84981740836551
She questioned Emmanuel but he knew nothing or would not say what he knew	88.83735628122227
During the night between the 4th and 5th of September Madame Morrel remained listening for every sound and until three oclock in the morning she heard her husband pacing the room in great agitation	112.67132066071086
It was three oclock when he threw himself on the bed	12.72224969680842
The mother and daughter passed the night together	79.64512280466549
They had expected Maximilian since the previous evening	50.16116103928181
At eight oclock in the morning Morrel entered their chamber	53.739701189148384
He was calm but the agitation of the night was legible in his pale and careworn visage	220.121250257064
They did not dare to ask him how he had slept	56.01004299244786
Morrel was kinder to his wife more affectionate to his daughter than he had ever been	80.30429084833006
He could not cease gazing at and kissing the sweet girl	207.9083890591707
Julie mindful of Emmanuels request was following her father when he quitted the room but he said to her quickly	66.1745253303294
I wish you to do so said he	15.442995837153177
This was the first time Morrel had ever so spoken but he said it in a tone of paternal kindness and Julie did not dare to disobey	89.29247410909603
She remained at the same spot standing mute and motionless	221.1971444904577
An instant afterwards the door opened she felt two arms encircle her and a mouth pressed her forehead	228.63202441643176
She looked up and uttered an exclamation of joy	21.350696452834725
Maximilian my dearest brother she cried	65.40440924921542
At these words Madame Morrel rose and threw herself into her sons arms	47.25667088008734
Mother said the young man looking alternately at Madame Morrel and her daughter what has occurredwhat has happened Your letter has frightened me and I have come hither with all speed	130.380939754427
Julie said Madame Morrel making a sign to the young man go and tell your father that Maximilian has just arrived	26.957496049928036
The young lady rushed out of the apartment but on the first step of the staircase she found a man holding a letter in his hand	23.246740488536034
Are you not Mademoiselle Julie Morrel inquired the man with a strong Italian accent	43.60725547807464
Yes sir replied Julie with hesitation what is your pleasure I do not know you	31.45008291323855
Read this letter he said handing it to her	237.7582942312524
It concerns the best interests of your father said the messenger	18.934152303566215
The young girl hastily took the letter from him	16.55037701855787
She opened it quickly and read	191.5095446270532
Go this moment to the Alles de Meilhan enter the house No	40.30052706991824
15 ask the porter for the key of the room on the fifth floor enter the apartment take from the corner of the mantelpiece a purse netted in red silk and give it to your father	51.0176517241927
It is important that he should receive it before eleven oclock	93.26323149346231
You promised to obey me implicitly	81156.55309689387
The young girl uttered a joyful cry raised her eyes looked round to question the messenger but he had disappeared	148.67934472659329
She cast her eyes again over the note to peruse it a second time and saw there was a postscript	122.65006191208973
It is important that you should fulfil this mission in person and alone	211.1544918192716
If you go accompanied by any other person or should anyone else go in your place the porter will reply that he does not know anything about it	68.53990678431023
This postscript decreased greatly the young girls happiness	149.47631233645507
Was there nothing to fear was there not some snare laid for her Her innocence had kept her in ignorance of the dangers that might assail a young girl of her age	269.3779263373472
But there is no need to know danger in order to fear it indeed it may be observed that it is usually unknown perils that inspire the greatest terror	177.0334855605808
Julie hesitated and resolved to take counsel	2479.6605647877145
Yet through a singular impulse it was neither to her mother nor her brother that she applied but to Emmanuel	137.2234716166885
She hastened down and told him what had occurred on the day when the agent of Thomson   French had come to her fathers related the scene on the staircase repeated the promise she had made and showed him the letter	65.491708005923
You must go then mademoiselle said Emmanuel	49.052380885556886
But did you not read that I must be alone said Julie	46.837606191037274
And you shall be alone replied the young man	10.388641274553361
I will await you at the corner of the Rue du Muse and if you are so long absent as to make me uneasy I will hasten to rejoin you and woe to him of whom you shall have cause to complain to me	49.70508631818522
Then Emmanuel said the young girl with hesitation it is your opinion that I should obey this invitation	67.72178697679087
Did not the messenger say your fathers safety depended upon it	364.42492227794946
But what danger threatens him then Emmanuel she asked	168.42034977493853
Emmanuel hesitated a moment but his desire to make Julie decide immediately made him reply	518.8178055628825
Listen he said today is the 5th of September is it not	31.000510510478286
Today then at eleven oclock your father has nearly three hundred thousand francs to pay	30.588769038081637
Well then continued Emmanuel we have not fifteen thousand francs in the house	23.641165942866778
Why if today before eleven oclock your father has not found someone who will come to his aid he will be compelled at twelve oclock to declare himself a bankrupt	59.568476271718694
Oh come then come cried she hastening away with the young man	62.30897033749912
During this time Madame Morrel had told her son everything	104.57551569148747
The young man knew quite well that after the succession of misfortunes which had befallen his father great changes had taken place in the style of living and housekeeping but he did not know that matters had reached such a point	111.64232868812428
Then rushing hastily out of the apartment he ran upstairs expecting to find his father in his study but he rapped there in vain	74.73068423526196
While he was yet at the door of the study he heard the bedroom door open turned and saw his father	29.89060013800215
Instead of going direct to his study M	84.79888081870335
Morrel had returned to his bedchamber which he was only this moment quitting	312.6542927758883
Morrel uttered a cry of surprise at the sight of his son of whose arrival he was ignorant	38.551691221191504
He remained motionless on the spot pressing with his left hand something he had concealed under his coat	99.59714803128348
Maximilian sprang down the staircase and threw his arms round his fathers neck but suddenly he recoiled and placed his right hand on Morrels breast	73.96997004722735
Father he exclaimed turning pale as death what are you going to do with that brace of pistols under your coat	81.10828727126056
Oh this is what I feared said Morrel	84.99104438882739
Father father in Heavens name exclaimed the young man what are these weapons for	75.04784106322971
Maximilian replied Morrel looking fixedly at his son you are a man and a man of honor	35.62275453577627
Come and I will explain to you	12.973398866999446
And with a firm step Morrel went up to his study while Maximilian followed him trembling as he went	31.046732035543446
Morrel opened the door and closed it behind his son then crossing the anteroom went to his desk on which he placed the pistols and pointed with his finger to an open ledger	79.24058741595043
In this ledger was made out an exact balancesheet of his affairs	217.46634119667533
Morrel had to pay within half an hour 287500 francs	136.22633658099525
All he possessed was 15257 francs	1109.5509287673287
The young man was overwhelmed as he read	74.95227786683232
What could he say What need he add to such a desperate proof in figures	367.2041850119594
And have you done all that is possible father to meet this disastrous result asked the young man after a moments pause	153.70160215247623
You have no money coming in on which you can rely	76.26096451843677
And in half an hour said Maximilian in a gloomy voice our name is dishonored	84.1544611728602
Blood washes out dishonor said Morrel	5.019482235012841
You are right father I understand you	45.84281860053542
Then extending his hand towards one of the pistols he said There is one for you and one for methanks	109.46330114347198
Your motheryour sister Who will support them	311.6686913066759
A shudder ran through the young mans frame	53.08496102018758
Father he said do you reflect that you are bidding me to live	50.49979664538746
Yes I do so bid you answered Morrel it is your duty	31.48760439076548
You have a calm strong mind Maximilian	563.4816773310533
Maximilian you are no ordinary man	40.544850883543106
I make no requests or commands I only ask you to examine my position as if it were your own and then judge for yourself	78.73437529004322
The young man reflected for a moment then an expression of sublime resignation appeared in his eyes and with a slow and sad gesture he took off his two epaulets the insignia of his rank	76.20737895770048
Be it so then my father he said extending his hand to Morrel die in peace my father I will live	33.86408258073308
Morrel was about to cast himself on his knees before his son but Maximilian caught him in his arms and those two noble hearts were pressed against each other for a moment	37.95093375060948
You know it is not my fault said Morrel	19.354577999005834
I know father you are the most honorable man I have ever known	48.465528307349274
And now there is no more to be said go and rejoin your mother and sister	116.4811231573234
My father said the young man bending his knee bless me Morrel took the head of his son between his two hands drew him forward and kissing his forehead several times said	116.4062336032836
Oh yes yes I bless you in my own name and in the name of three generations of irreproachable men who say through me The edifice which misfortune has destroyed Providence may build up again	158.40283451296222
On seeing me die such a death the most inexorable will have pity on you	97.96690119615302
To you perhaps they will accord the time they have refused to me	122.14910600498109
Then do your best to keep our name free from dishonor	284.0350260834387
Go to work labor young man struggle ardently and courageously live yourself your mother and sister with the most rigid economy so that from day to day the property of those whom I leave in your hands may augment and fructify	330.0469499004876
Reflect how glorious a day it will be how grand how solemn that day of complete restoration on which you will say in this very office My father died because he could not do what I have this day done but he died calmly and peaceably because in dying he knew what I should do	142.72869856934832
My father my father cried the young man why should you not live	20.529240348188218
If I live all would be changed if I live interest would be converted into doubt pity into hostility if I live I am only a man who has broken his word failed in his engagementsin fact only a bankrupt	227.48369617051517
If on the contrary I die remember Maximilian my corpse is that of an honest but unfortunate man	243.75672843949684
Living my best friends would avoid my house dead all Marseilles will follow me in tears to my last home	203.1451185323537
Living you would feel shame at my name dead you may raise your head and say I am the son of him you killed because for the first time he has been compelled to break his word	51.1635906073209
The young man uttered a groan but appeared resigned	431.87310404886193
And now said Morrel leave me alone and endeavor to keep your mother and sister away	108.2071334463989
Will you not see my sister once more asked Maximilian	279.70216959873034
A last but final hope was concealed by the young man in the effect of this interview and therefore he had suggested it	42.44244950958618
I saw her this morning and bade her adieu	209.75877359131982
Have you no particular commands to leave with me my father inquired Maximilian in a faltering voice	51.35350087737489
Yes my son and a sacred command	1730.100885956434
The house of Thomson   French is the only one who from humanity or it may be selfishnessit is not for me to read mens heartshas had any pity for me	158.90600658082303
Its agent who will in ten minutes present himself to receive the amount of a bill of 287500 francs I will not say granted but offered me three months	114.98712380751806
Let this house be the first repaid my son and respect this man	214.36499202287845
And now once more adieu said Morrel	6.036867784595601
Go leave me I would be alone	29.145843347849155
You will find my will in the secretaire in my bedroom	84.16214853899424
The young man remained standing and motionless having but the force of will and not the power of execution	135.63113857915508
Hear me Maximilian said his father	4.815123660817475
Suppose I were a soldier like you and ordered to carry a certain redoubt and you knew I must be killed in the assault would you not say to me as you said just now Go father for you are dishonored by delay and death is preferable to shame	108.08951963091454
Yes yes said the young man yes and once again embracing his father with convulsive pressure he said Be it so my father	146.78077365578153
And he rushed out of the study	14.402338438288377
When his son had left him Morrel remained an instant standing with his eyes fixed on the door then putting forth his arm he pulled the bell	46.91408185847997
After a moments interval Cocles appeared	79.33997528483822
It was no longer the same manthe fearful revelations of the three last days had crushed him	555.0336679598652
This thoughtthe house of Morrel is about to stop paymentbent him to the earth more than twenty years would otherwise have done	84.46167545014987
My worthy Cocles said Morrel in a tone impossible to describe do you remain in the antechamber	41.72144934307565
When the gentleman who came three months agothe agent of Thomson   Frencharrives announce his arrival to me	521.2278405895389
Cocles made no reply he made a sign with his head went into the anteroom and seated himself	24.807822972765713
Morrel fell back in his chair his eyes fixed on the clock there were seven minutes left that was all	52.695786857124354
The hand moved on with incredible rapidity he seemed to see its motion	189.0837743359336
What passed in the mind of this man at the supreme moment of his agony can not be told in words	72.17994461039572
He was still comparatively young he was surrounded by the loving care of a devoted family but he had convinced himself by a course of reasoning illogical perhaps yet certainly plausible that he must separate himself from all he held dear in the world even life itself	197.63215156186067
To form the slightest idea of his feelings one must have seen his face with its expression of enforced resignation and its tearmoistened eyes raised to heaven	117.83392756676652
The pistols were loaded he stretched forth his hand took one up and murmured his daughters name	289.85452661974404
Then he laid it down seized his pen and wrote a few words	34.92802637783087
It seemed to him as if he had not taken a sufficient farewell of his beloved daughter	79.67474225583386
Then he turned again to the clock counting time now not by minutes but by seconds	845.0041335291484
He took up the deadly weapon again his lips parted and his eyes fixed on the clock and then shuddered at the click of the trigger as he cocked the pistol	100.1195923839215
At this moment of mortal anguish the cold sweat came forth upon his brow a pang stronger than death clutched at his heartstrings	347.73031091703257
He heard the door of the staircase creak on its hingesthe clock gave its warning to strike eleventhe door of his study opened	326.96958232169095
Morrel did not turn roundhe expected these words of Cocles The agent of Thomson   French	182.08122382539784
He placed the muzzle of the pistol between his teeth	44.19831986076103
Suddenly he heard a cryit was his daughters voice	219.28701782375106
The pistol fell from his hands	11.009464500180336
My father cried the young girl out of breath and half dead with joysaved you are saved And she threw herself into his arms holding in her extended hand a red netted silk purse	110.92081831022097
Saved my child said Morrel what do you mean	13.508846163371782
Yes savedsaved See see said the young girl	6.2008560910290464
Morrel took the purse and started as he did so for a vague remembrance reminded him that it once belonged to himself	163.55576806514762
At one end was the receipted bill for the 287000 francs and at the other was a diamond as large as a hazelnut with these words on a small slip of parchment Julies Dowry	332.3858242363183
Morrel passed his hand over his brow it seemed to him a dream	28.38869377974861
At this moment the clock struck eleven	70.10931945422584
He felt as if each stroke of the hammer fell upon his heart	79.15411186884944
Explain my child he said Explain my child he said explainwhere did you find this purse	305.00601761427146
In a house in the Alles de Meilhan No	22.373518211801358
15 on the corner of a mantelpiece in a small room on the fifth floor	40.631035100720645
But cried Morrel this purse is not yours Julie handed to her father the letter she had received in the morning	72.1310979595916
And did you go alone asked Morrel after he had read it	29.193270485488725
He was to have waited for me at the corner of the Rue du Muse but strange to say he was not there when I returned	45.1187762867404
Monsieur Morrel exclaimed a voice on the stairs Monsieur Morrel	64.33356044316488
It is his voice said Julie	293.7347851790876
At this moment Emmanuel entered his countenance full of animation and joy	122.48515825485691
The Pharaon he cried the Pharaon	3129.9247096526115
Whatwhatthe Pharaon Are you mad Emmanuel You know the vessel is lost	100.76793325222599
The Pharaon sirthey signal the Pharaon The Pharaon is entering the harbor	255.81130917476324
Morrel fell back in his chair his strength was failing him his understanding weakened by such events refused to comprehend such incredible unheardof fabulous facts	763.8272267267077
Father cried Maximilian how could you say the Pharaon was lost The lookout has signalled her and they say she is now coming into port	209.65359905168026
My dear friends said Morrel if this be so it must be a miracle of heaven Impossible impossible	189.49166191044628
But what was real and not less incredible was the purse he held in his hand the acceptance receiptedthe splendid diamond	374.48754777818647
Ah sir exclaimed Cocles what can it meanthe Pharaon	2721.379124997564
Come dear ones said Morrel rising from his seat let us go and see and Heaven have pity upon us if it be false intelligence	75.57572931129334
They all went out and on the stairs met Madame Morrel who had been afraid to go up into the study	31.289565862044395
In a moment they were at the Canebire	214.49093077188704
There was a crowd on the pier	334.26557516037633
All the crowd gave way before Morrel	57.28149865205142
The Pharaon the Pharaon said every voice	966.7350766876497
And wonderful to see in front of the tower of SaintJean was a ship bearing on her stern these words printed in white letters The Pharaon Morrel   Son of Marseilles	221.7271488549576
She was the exact duplicate of the other Pharaon and loaded as that had been with cochineal and indigo	197.40937931473056
She cast anchor clued up sails and on the deck was Captain Gaumard giving orders and good old Penelon making signals to M	609.2984153564806
To doubt any longer was impossible there was the evidence of the senses and ten thousand persons who came to corroborate the testimony	97.19549317019829
As Morrel and his son embraced on the pierhead in the presence and amid the applause of the whole city witnessing this event a man with his face halfcovered by a black beard and who concealed behind the sentrybox watched the scene with delight uttered these words in a low tone	119.15070298800539
Be happy noble heart be blessed for all the good thou hast done and wilt do hereafter and let my gratitude remain in obscurity like your good deeds	298.83778987041154
And with a smile expressive of supreme content he left his hidingplace and without being observed descended one of the flights of steps provided for debarkation and hailing three times shouted Jacopo Jacopo Jacopo	670.4854647572683
Then a launch came to shore took him on board and conveyed him to a yacht splendidly fitted up on whose deck he sprung with the activity of a sailor thence he once again looked towards Morrel who weeping with joy was shaking hands most cordially with all the crowd around him and thanking with a look the unknown benefactor whom he seemed to be seeking in the skies	194.40102393233963
And now said the unknown farewell kindness humanity and gratitude Farewell to all the feelings that expand the heart I have been Heavens substitute to recompense the goodnow the god of vengeance yields to me his power to punish the wicked	369.0560785297077
At these words he gave a signal and as if only awaiting this signal the yacht instantly put out to sea	222.874038835359
Towards the beginning of the year 1838 two young men belonging to the first society of Paris the Viscount Albert de Morcerf and the Baron Franz dpinay were at Florence	109.35911352878142
They had agreed to see the Carnival at Rome that year and that Franz who for the last three or four years had inhabited Italy should act as cicerone to Albert	116.61550147153191
As it is no inconsiderable affair to spend the Carnival at Rome especially when you have no great desire to sleep on the Piazza del Popolo or the Campo Vaccino they wrote to Signor Pastrini the proprietor of the Htel de Londres Piazza di Spagna to reserve comfortable apartments for them	181.13798344660975
Signor Pastrini replied that he had only two rooms and a parlor on the third floor which he offered at the low charge of a louis per diem	109.2949014828318
They accepted his offer but wishing to make the best use of the time that was left Albert started for Naples	131.70952881763378
As for Franz he remained at Florence and after having passed a few days in exploring the paradise of the Cascine and spending two or three evenings at the houses of the Florentine nobility he took a fancy into his head having already visited Corsica the cradle of Bonaparte to visit Elba the waitingplace of Napoleon	206.0354313641976
One evening he cast off the painter of a sailboat from the iron ring that secured it to the dock at Leghorn wrapped himself in his coat and lay down and said to the crewTo the Island of Elba	113.69858475738631
The boat shot out of the harbor like a bird and the next morning Franz disembarked at PortoFerrajo	176.863324142369
He traversed the island after having followed the traces which the footsteps of the giant have left and reembarked for Marciana	294.74503594164605
Two hours after he again landed at Pianosa where he was assured that red partridges abounded	763.4644751073463
The sport was bad Franz only succeeded in killing a few partridges and like every unsuccessful sportsman he returned to the boat very much out of temper	385.2587501683809
Ah if your excellency chose said the captain you might have capital sport	316.5972849374464
Do you see that island continued the captain pointing to a conical pile rising from the indigo sea	482.9689627211394
But I have no permission to shoot over this island	204.0989493936306
Your excellency does not require a permit for the island is uninhabited	293.6280860584541
Ah indeed said the young man	2.4557714719355346
A desert island in the midst of the Mediterranean must be a curiosity	63.6534394699372
It is very natural this island is a mass of rocks and does not contain an acre of land capable of cultivation	226.87872098256142
To whom does this island belong	4154.337408133606
What game shall I find there	393.3335628821578
Who live upon the stones I suppose said Franz with an incredulous smile	110.89384925958107
No but by browsing the shrubs and trees that grow out of the crevices of the rocks	108.90879940479469
On shore in the grottos or on board in your cloak besides if your excellency pleases we can leave as soon as you likewe can sail as well by night as by day and if the wind drops we can use our oars	231.59112106820783
As Franz had sufficient time and his apartments at Rome were not yet available he accepted the proposition	152.9212623749965
Upon his answer in the affirmative the sailors exchanged a few words together in a low tone	89.85745543503755
Well asked he what now Is there any difficulty in the way	83.87504241811925
replied the captain but we must warn your excellency that the island is an infected port	236.4690063654707
Monte Cristo although uninhabited yet serves occasionally as a refuge for the smugglers and pirates who come from Corsica Sardinia and Africa and if it becomes known that we have been there we shall have to perform quarantine for six days on our return to Leghorn	183.1206411530369
The deuce That puts a different face on the matter	139.7888468240444
Six days Why that s as long as the Almighty took to make the world Too long a waittoo long	250.4416000878307
But who will say your excellency has been to Monte Cristo	25.83809765482865
Oh I shall not cried Franz	1823.6381912418733
Nor I nor I chorused the sailors	207.48908093332125
The captain gave his orders the helm was put up and the boat was soon sailing in the direction of the island	86.15428566355244
Franz waited until all was in order and when the sail was filled and the four sailors had taken their placesthree forward and one at the helmhe resumed the conversation	175.22388947376103
Gaetano said he to the captain you tell me Monte Cristo serves as a refuge for pirates who are it seems to me a very different kind of game from the goats	155.0505249376492
Yes your excellency and it is true	12.402776883674182
I knew there were smugglers but I thought that since the capture of Algiers and the destruction of the regency pirates existed only in the romances of Cooper and Captain Marryat	337.1929529856649
Your excellency is mistaken there are pirates like the bandits who were believed to have been exterminated by Pope Leo XII	462.1469534276349
and who yet every day rob travellers at the gates of Rome	251.8303492502634
Has not your excellency heard that the French charg daffaires was robbed six months ago within five hundred paces of Velletri	209.60945354736924
Well then if like us your excellency lived at Leghorn you would hear from time to time that a little merchant vessel or an English yacht that was expected at Bastia at PortoFerrajo or at Civita Vecchia has not arrived no one knows what has become of it but doubtless it has struck on a rock and foundered	138.4882911931932
Now this rock it has met has been a long and narrow boat manned by six or eight men who have surprised and plundered it some dark and stormy night near some desert and gloomy island as bandits plunder a carriage in the recesses of a forest	271.2109408353506
But asked Franz who lay wrapped in his cloak at the bottom of the boat why do not those who have been plundered complain to the French Sardinian or Tuscan governments	128.31905112483176
Why said Gaetano with a smile	5.251068864965937
Because in the first place they transfer from the vessel to their own boat whatever they think worth taking then they bind the crew hand and foot they attach to everyones neck a fourandtwentypound ball a large hole is chopped in the vessels bottom and then they leave her	454.5051728538537
At the end of ten minutes the vessel begins to roll heavily and settle down	404.7878041476553
First one gunl goes under then the other	148.21748243544727
Then they lift and sink again and both go under at once	210.49711419036785
All at once there s a noise like a cannonthats the air blowing up the deck	245.93324342138646
Soon the water rushes out of the scupperholes like a whale spouting the vessel gives a last groan spins round and round and disappears forming a vast whirlpool in the ocean and then all is over so that in five minutes nothing but the eye of God can see the vessel where she lies at the bottom of the sea	175.18867120731892
Do you understand now said the captain why no complaints are made to the government and why the vessel never reaches port	470.7930941245214
It is probable that if Gaetano had related this previous to proposing the expedition Franz would have hesitated but now that they had started he thought it would be cowardly to draw back	225.61405206070106
He was one of those men who do not rashly court danger but if danger presents itself combat it with the most unalterable coolness	377.1033993320918
Calm and resolute he treated any peril as he would an adversary in a duelcalculated its probable method of approach retreated if at all as a point of strategy and not from cowardice was quick to see an opening for attack and won victory at a single thrust	482.0121119448626
Bah said he I have travelled through Sicily and CalabriaI have sailed two months in the Archipelago and yet I never saw even the shadow of a bandit or a pirate	239.66241086479383
I did not tell your excellency this to deter you from your project replied Gaetano but you questioned me and I have answered that s all	115.27704887645747
Yes and your conversation is most interesting and as I wish to enjoy it as long as possible steer for Monte Cristo	86.77411141925792
The wind blew strongly the boat made six or seven knots an hour and they were rapidly reaching the end of their voyage	145.33262496762853
As they drew near the island seemed to lift from the sea and the air was so clear that they could already distinguish the rocks heaped on one another like cannon balls in an arsenal with green bushes and trees growing in the crevices	181.96420784172247
As for the sailors although they appeared perfectly tranquil yet it was evident that they were on the alert and that they carefully watched the glassy surface over which they were sailing and on which a few fishingboats with their white sails were alone visible	154.98029629733043
They were within fifteen miles of Monte Cristo when the sun began to set behind Corsica whose mountains appeared against the sky showing their rugged peaks in bold relief this mass of rock like the giant Adamastor rose dead ahead a formidable barrier and intercepting the light that gilded its massive peaks so that the voyagers were in shadow	338.9692655811865
Little by little the shadow rose higher and seemed to drive before it the last rays of the expiring day at last the reflection rested on the summit of the mountain where it paused an instant like the fiery crest of a volcano then gloom gradually covered the summit as it had covered the base and the island now only appeared to be a gray mountain that grew continually darker half an hour after the night was quite dark	173.23999715199295
Fortunately the mariners were used to these latitudes and knew every rock in the Tuscan Archipelago for in the midst of this obscurity Franz was not without uneasinessCorsica had long since disappeared and Monte Cristo itself was invisible but the sailors seemed like the lynx to see in the dark and the pilot who steered did not evince the slightest hesitation	214.59776216954398
An hour had passed since the sun had set when Franz fancied he saw at a quarter of a mile to the left a dark mass but he could not precisely make out what it was and fearing to excite the mirth of the sailors by mistaking a floating cloud for land he remained silent suddenly a great light appeared on the strand land might resemble a cloud but the fire was not a meteor	165.7113120750711
What is this light asked he	38.48980827129109
Hush said the captain it is a fire	69.60800876165756
But you told me the island was uninhabited	3050.157729843616
I said there were no fixed habitations on it but I said also that it served sometimes as a harbor for smugglers	305.337919470479
And for pirates returned Gaetano repeating Franzs words	6055.773624748134
It is for that reason I have given orders to pass the island for as you see the fire is behind us	77.26344560511797
It seems to me rather reassuring than otherwise men who did not wish to be seen would not light a fire	169.33535712595088
Oh that goes for nothing said Gaetano	870.1621893686955
If you can guess the position of the island in the darkness you will see that the fire can not be seen from the side or from Pianosa but only from the sea	69.29273060020944
You think then this fire indicates the presence of unpleasant neighbors	701.600907026931
That is what we must find out returned Gaetano fixing his eyes on this terrestrial star	307.1460073992952
Gaetano consulted with his companions and after five minutes discussion a manuvre was executed which caused the vessel to tack about they returned the way they had come and in a few minutes the fire disappeared hidden by an elevation of the land	145.52380102800538
The pilot again changed the course of the boat which rapidly approached the island and was soon within fifty paces of it	114.662120919585
Gaetano lowered the sail and the boat came to rest	115.94829783506478
All this was done in silence and from the moment that their course was changed not a word was spoken	96.83600260475897
Gaetano who had proposed the expedition had taken all the responsibility on himself the four sailors fixed their eyes on him while they got out their oars and held themselves in readiness to row away which thanks to the darkness would not be difficult	97.05971365741338
As for Franz he examined his arms with the utmost coolness he had two doublebarrelled guns and a rifle he loaded them looked at the priming and waited quietly	173.04763688319343
During this time the captain had thrown off his vest and shirt and secured his trousers round his waist his feet were naked so he had no shoes and stockings to take off after these preparations he placed his finger on his lips and lowering himself noiselessly into the sea swam towards the shore with such precaution that it was impossible to hear the slightest sound he could only be traced by the phosphorescent line in his wake	104.58796439606103
This track soon disappeared it was evident that he had touched the shore	29.75666555360481
Everyone on board remained motionless for half an hour when the same luminous track was again observed and the swimmer was soon on board	166.86388112282435
Well exclaimed Franz and the sailors in unison	3099.951220318362
They are Spanish smugglers said he they have with them two Corsican bandits	156.08700540748356
And what are these Corsican bandits doing here with Spanish smugglers	951.6632461515342
Alas returned the captain with an accent of the most profound pity we ought always to help one another	73.59591733112897
Very often the bandits are hard pressed by gendarmes or carbineers well they see a vessel and good fellows like us on board they come and demand hospitality of us you ca nt refuse help to a poor hunted devil we receive them and for greater security we stand out to sea	306.0891236566721
This costs us nothing and saves the life or at least the liberty of a fellowcreature who on the first occasion returns the service by pointing out some safe spot where we can land our goods without interruption	189.55655026219037
Ah said Franz then you are a smuggler occasionally Gaetano	1047.9055537862853
Your excellency we must live somehow returned the other smiling impenetrably	2519.2756283923377
Then you know the men who are now on Monte Cristo	33.67597332737036
Oh yes we sailors are like freemasons and recognize each other by signs	352.9149358997032
And do you think we have nothing to fear if we land	138.25587477132726
Nothing at all smugglers are not thieves	468.09583825848523
But these two Corsican bandits said Franz calculating the chances of peril	542.0477481754762
It is not their fault that they are bandits but that of the authorities	121.9693375014543
Because they are pursued for having made a stiff as if it was not in a Corsicans nature to revenge himself	114.47053531950287
What do you mean by having made a stiffhaving assassinated a man said Franz continuing his investigation	678.6820444969444
I mean that they have killed an enemy which is a very different thing returned the captain	85.2005568775795
Well said the young man let us demand hospitality of these smugglers and bandits	211.5235250841029
Do you think they will grant it	115.60677358649592
Four and the two bandits make six	567.3353011772207
Just our number so that if they prove troublesome we shall be able to hold them in check so for the last time steer to Monte Cristo	91.32901512851026
Yes but your excellency will permit us to take all due precautions	100.71850718410657
By all means be as wise as Nestor and as prudent as Ulysses I do more than permit I exhort you	281.21234194096576
For a man who like Franz viewed his position in its true light it was a grave one	132.6102351383538
He was alone in the darkness with sailors whom he did not know and who had no reason to be devoted to him who knew that he had several thousand francs in his belt and who had often examined his weaponswhich were very beautifulif not with envy at least with curiosity	89.15584893345762
On the other hand he was about to land without any other escort than these men on an island which had indeed a very religious name but which did not seem to Franz likely to afford him much hospitality thanks to the smugglers and bandits	155.16190035031502
The history of the scuttled vessels which had appeared improbable during the day seemed very probable at night placed as he was between two possible sources of danger he kept his eye on the crew and his gun in his hand	176.83750201386593
The sailors had again hoisted sail and the vessel was once more cleaving the waves	226.66101966978212
Through the darkness Franz whose eyes were now more accustomed to it could see the looming shore along which the boat was sailing and then as they rounded a rocky point he saw the fire more brilliant than ever and about it five or six persons seated	138.81798262117144
The blaze illumined the sea for a hundred paces around	32.578741768647205
Gaetano skirted the light carefully keeping the boat in the shadow then when they were opposite the fire he steered to the centre of the circle singing a fishing song of which his companions sung the chorus	206.90106620461617
At the first words of the song the men seated round the fire arose and approached the landingplace their eyes fixed on the boat evidently seeking to know who the newcomers were and what were their intentions	158.1434136074323
They soon appeared satisfied and returned with the exception of one who remained at the shore to their fire at which the carcass of a goat was roasting	121.84180690419524
When the boat was within twenty paces of the shore the man on the beach who carried a carbine presented arms after the manner of a sentinel and cried Who comes there in Sardinian	181.72384225522083
Gaetano then exchanged a few words with this man which the traveller did not understand but which evidently concerned him	98.02945909654017
Will your excellency give your name or remain incognito asked the captain	200.1321884128458
My name must rest unknown replied Franz merely say I am a Frenchman travelling for pleasure	330.31542331391773
As soon as Gaetano had transmitted this answer the sentinel gave an order to one of the men seated round the fire who rose and disappeared among the rocks	155.78241609002612
Not a word was spoken everyone seemed occupied Franz with his disembarkment the sailors with their sails the smugglers with their goat but in the midst of all this carelessness it was evident that they mutually observed each other	188.92965071661374
The man who had disappeared returned suddenly on the opposite side to that by which he had left he made a sign with his head to the sentinel who turning to the boat said Saccommodi	68.51734395289567
The Italian saccommodi is untranslatable it means at once Come enter you are welcome make yourself at home you are the master	256.04607163738166
It is like that Turkish phrase of Molires that so astonished the bourgeois gentleman by the number of things implied in its utterance	393.4619451116574
The sailors did not wait for a second invitation four strokes of the oar brought them to land Gaetano sprang to shore exchanged a few words with the sentinel then his comrades disembarked and lastly came Franz	356.72834668161767
One of his guns was swung over his shoulder Gaetano had the other and a sailor held his rifle his dress half artist half dandy did not excite any suspicion and consequently no disquietude	396.82198544841236
The boat was moored to the shore and they advanced a few paces to find a comfortable bivouac but doubtless the spot they chose did not suit the smuggler who filled the post of sentinel for he cried out	172.3408962121712
Not that way if you please	4.692278222503907
Gaetano faltered an excuse and advanced to the opposite side while two sailors kindled torches at the fire to light them on their way	175.32456565417272
They advanced about thirty paces and then stopped at a small esplanade surrounded with rocks in which seats had been cut not unlike sentryboxes	461.199424728851
Around in the crevices of the rocks grew a few dwarf oaks and thick bushes of myrtles	422.98425520929516
Franz lowered a torch and saw by the mass of cinders that had accumulated that he was not the first to discover this retreat which was doubtless one of the haltingplaces of the wandering visitors of Monte Cristo	89.04218265945767
As for his suspicions once on terra firma once that he had seen the indifferent if not friendly appearance of his hosts his anxiety had quite disappeared or rather at sight of the goat had turned to appetite	272.2073302945021
He mentioned this to Gaetano who replied that nothing could be more easy than to prepare a supper when they had in their boat bread wine half a dozen partridges and a good fire to roast them by	176.76212728737738
Besides added he if the smell of their roast meat tempts you I will go and offer them two of our birds for a slice	285.36442292059036
You are a born diplomat returned Franz go and try	761.7693109460413
Meanwhile the sailors had collected dried sticks and branches with which they made a fire	327.39125242027603
Franz waited impatiently inhaling the aroma of the roasted meat when the captain returned with a mysterious air	194.13127118608986
Well said Franz anything newdo they refuse	660.9086478091
On the contrary returned Gaetano the chief who was told you were a young Frenchman invites you to sup with him	133.64969755129138
Well observed Franz this chief is very polite and I see no objectionthe more so as I bring my share of the supper	163.09631142599517
Oh it is not that he has plenty and to spare for supper but he makes one condition and rather a peculiar one before he will receive you at his house	163.00282665619568
His house Has he built one here then	244.086733108819
No but he has a very comfortable one all the same so they say	173.7900038414236
I have heard talk of him	41.85860016327797
The deuceand what is this condition	1849.457917683555
That you are blindfolded and do not take off the bandage until he himself bids you	167.1027815720492
Franz looked at Gaetano to see if possible what he thought of this proposal	119.4600277472793
Ah replied he guessing Franzs thought I know this is a serious matter	62.102549367307766
What should you do in my place	31.226899541392303
I who have nothing to loseI should go	2183.564751515348
Yes were it only out of curiosity	57.859983579943325
There is something very peculiar about this chief then	334.5756033714109
Listen said Gaetano lowering his voice I do not know if what they say is truehe stopped to see if anyone was near	97.25818363943918
That this chief inhabits a cavern to which the Pitti Palace is nothing	317.1675458510655
What nonsense said Franz reseating himself	8.645483274145775
It is no nonsense it is quite true	38.39942403077575
Cama the pilot of the Saint Ferdinand went in once and he came back amazed vowing that such treasures were only to be heard of in fairy tales	387.2332112140993
Do you know observed Franz that with such stories you make me think of Ali Babas enchanted cavern	433.34900453715653
I tell you what I have been told	24.21009473889815
Then you advise me to accept	985.9928482274604
Oh I do nt say that your excellency will do as you please I should be sorry to advise you in the matter	38.51329066739944
Franz pondered the matter for a few moments concluded that a man so rich could not have any intention of plundering him of what little he had and seeing only the prospect of a good supper accepted	142.63172659256193
Franz was prudent and wished to learn all he possibly could concerning his host	383.8918279015615
He turned towards the sailor who during this dialogue had sat gravely plucking the partridges with the air of a man proud of his office and asked him how these men had landed as no vessel of any kind was visible	179.1178732563337
Never mind that returned the sailor I know their vessel	650.2935385000886
Is it a very beautiful vessel	5570.065680225639
I would not wish for a better to sail round the world	132.1910047052248
About a hundred tons but she is built to stand any weather	509.1300829016581
She is what the English call a yacht	378.2723755621093
I know not but my own opinion is she is a Genoese	97.28795998562164
And how did a leader of smugglers continued Franz venture to build a vessel designed for such a purpose at Genoa	531.4011133278697
I did not say that the owner was a smuggler replied the sailor	203.46586731722329
No but Gaetano did I thought	188.61267034950407
Gaetano had only seen the vessel from a distance he had not then spoken to anyone	101.32174361469377
And if this person be not a smuggler who is he	71.0514237123154
A wealthy signor who travels for his pleasure	121.73630037538912
Come thought Franz he is still more mysterious since the two accounts do not agree	172.5984267369762
If you ask him he says Sinbad the Sailor but I doubt if it be his real name	105.71007368388125
What country does he come from	18.59769278097952
What sort of a man is he	97.09457476687813
Your excellency will judge for yourself	24.087828392086266
No doubt in the subterranean palace Gaetano told you of	775.4754935676597
Have you never had the curiosity when you have landed and found this island deserted to seek for this enchanted palace	506.020580586683
Oh yes more than once but always in vain we examined the grotto all over but we never could find the slightest trace of any opening they say that the door is not opened by a key but a magic word	182.27376743629208
Decidedly muttered Franz this is an Arabian Nights adventure	2413.205126722871
His excellency waits for you said a voice which he recognized as that of the sentinel	58.73916251699704
He was accompanied by two of the yachts crew	911.2431529562331
Franz drew his handkerchief from his pocket and presented it to the man who had spoken to him	9.486958526911605
Without uttering a word they bandaged his eyes with a care that showed their apprehensions of his committing some indiscretion	587.1209444604733
Afterwards he was made to promise that he would not make the least attempt to raise the bandage	44.80735436821389
Then his two guides took his arms and he went on guided by them and preceded by the sentinel	71.42131113258861
After going about thirty paces he smelt the appetizing odor of the kid that was roasting and knew thus that he was passing the bivouac they then led him on about fifty paces farther evidently advancing towards that part of the shore where they would not allow Gaetano to goa refusal he could now comprehend	254.47849490558895
Presently by a change in the atmosphere he knew that they were entering a cave after going on for a few seconds more he heard a crackling and it seemed to him as though the atmosphere again changed and became balmy and perfumed	164.27504903676027
At length his feet touched on a thick and soft carpet and his guides let go their hold of him	190.01203855213382
There was a moments silence and then a voice in excellent French although with a foreign accent said	140.8913238346795
I beg you will remove your bandage	181.81990037395582
It may be supposed then Franz did not wait for a repetition of this permission but took off the handkerchief and found himself in the presence of a man from thirtyeight to forty years of age dressed in a Tunisian costume that is to say a red cap with a long blue silk tassel a vest of black cloth embroidered with gold pantaloons of deep red large and full gaiters of the same color embroidered with gold like the vest and yellow slippers he had a splendid cashmere round his waist and a small sharp and crooked cangiar was passed through his girdle	100.63871197971424
Although of a paleness that was almost livid this man had a remarkably handsome face his eyes were penetrating and sparkling his nose quite straight and projecting direct from the brow was of the pure Greek type while his teeth as white as pearls were set off to admiration by the black moustache that encircled them	259.1571497959278
His pallor was so peculiar that it seemed to pertain to one who had been long entombed and who was incapable of resuming the healthy glow and hue of life	150.901532149335
He was not particularly tall but extremely well made and like the men of the South had small hands and feet	285.26673373745285
But what astonished Franz who had treated Gaetanos description as a fable was the splendor of the apartment in which he found himself	133.9697602731353
The entire chamber was lined with crimson brocade worked with flowers of gold	130.972974409274
In a recess was a kind of divan surmounted with a stand of Arabian swords in silver scabbards and the handles resplendent with gems from the ceiling hung a lamp of Venetian glass of beautiful shape and color while the feet rested on a Turkey carpet in which they sunk to the instep tapestry hung before the door by which Franz had entered and also in front of another door leading into a second apartment which seemed to be brilliantly illuminated	181.26418487142678
The host gave Franz time to recover from his surprise and moreover returned look for look not even taking his eyes off him	196.47198081226423
Sir he said after a pause a thousand excuses for the precaution taken in your introduction hither but as during the greater portion of the year this island is deserted if the secret of this abode were discovered I should doubtless find on my return my temporary retirement in a state of great disorder which would be exceedingly annoying not for the loss it occasioned me but because I should not have the certainty I now possess of separating myself from all the rest of mankind at pleasure	225.68417654932642
Let me now endeavor to make you forget this temporary unpleasantness and offer you what no doubt you did not expect to find herethat is to say a tolerable supper and pretty comfortable beds	275.17056176860274
Ma foi my dear sir replied Franz make no apologies	771.2178701020505
I have always observed that they bandage peoples eyes who penetrate enchanted palaces for instance those of Raoul in the Huguenots and really I have nothing to complain of for what I see makes me think of the wonders of the Arabian Nights	299.76910901605453
Alas I may say with Lucullus if I could have anticipated the honor of your visit I would have prepared for it	63.789556285298964
But such as is my hermitage it is at your disposal such as is my supper it is yours to share if you will	98.72676477130031
At this moment the tapestry moved aside and a Nubian black as ebony and dressed in a plain white tunic made a sign to his master that all was prepared in the diningroom	105.05317184589293
Now said the unknown to Franz I do not know if you are of my opinion but I think nothing is more annoying than to remain two or three hours together without knowing by name or appellation how to address one another	72.74846907946433
Pray observe that I too much respect the laws of hospitality to ask your name or title	153.29838041150754
I only request you to give me one by which I may have the pleasure of addressing you	39.645431219046806
As for myself that I may put you at your ease I tell you that I am generally called Sinbad the Sailor	46.389218932769275
And I replied Franz will tell you as I only require his wonderful lamp to make me precisely like Aladdin that I see no reason why at this moment I should not be called Aladdin	137.23732508028695
That will keep us from going away from the East whither I am tempted to think I have been conveyed by some good genius	86.30230121117495
Well then Signor Aladdin replied the singular Amphitryon you heard our repast announced will you now take the trouble to enter the diningroom your humble servant going first to show the way	301.68508701086955
At these words moving aside the tapestry Sinbad preceded his guest	393.9609610357508
Franz now looked upon another scene of enchantment the table was splendidly covered and once convinced of this important point he cast his eyes around him	205.61629074248012
The diningroom was scarcely less striking than the room he had just left it was entirely of marble with antique basreliefs of priceless value and at the four corners of this apartment which was oblong were four magnificent statues having baskets in their hands	209.5451262063279
These baskets contained four pyramids of most splendid fruit there were Sicily pineapples pomegranates from Malaga oranges from the Balearic Isles peaches from France and dates from Tunis	1358.2208700919796
The supper consisted of a roast pheasant garnished with Corsican blackbirds a boars ham with jelly a quarter of a kid with tartar sauce a glorious turbot and a gigantic lobster	1319.4033541370627
Between these large dishes were smaller ones containing various dainties	16151.903819464094
The dishes were of silver and the plates of Japanese china	542.8077979448925
Franz rubbed his eyes in order to assure himself that this was not a dream	42.56925070931404
Ali alone was present to wait at table and acquitted himself so admirably that the guest complimented his host thereupon	494.6918851606095
Yes replied he while he did the honors of the supper with much ease and graceyes he is a poor devil who is much devoted to me and does all he can to prove it	81.91701385241545
He remembers that I saved his life and as he has a regard for his head he feels some gratitude towards me for having kept it on his shoulders	87.94170566694316
Ali approached his master took his hand and kissed it	15.920385473701192
Would it be impertinent Signor Sinbad said Franz to ask you the particulars of this kindness	82.25823753305312
Oh they are simple enough replied the host	63.689424049197214
It seems the fellow had been caught wandering nearer to the harem of the Bey of Tunis than etiquette permits to one of his color and he was condemned by the Bey to have his tongue cut out and his hand and head cut off the tongue the first day the hand the second and the head the third	148.92085070352132
I always had a desire to have a mute in my service so learning the day his tongue was cut out I went to the Bey and proposed to give him for Ali a splendid doublebarreled gun which I knew he was very desirous of having	116.13739342070426
He hesitated a moment he was so very desirous to complete the poor devils punishment	190.51183656929402
But when I added to the gun an English cutlass with which I had shivered his highnesss yataghan to pieces the Bey yielded and agreed to forgive the hand and head but on condition that the poor fellow never again set foot in Tunis	395.656752938893
This was a useless clause in the bargain for whenever the coward sees the first glimpse of the shores of Africa he runs down below and can only be induced to appear again when we are out of sight of that quarter of the globe	152.66840890881522
Franz remained a moment silent and pensive hardly knowing what to think of the halfkindness halfcruelty with which his host related the brief narrative	537.8105804529586
And like the celebrated sailor whose name you have assumed he said by way of changing the conversation you pass your life in travelling	79.45602637132623
I made a vow at a time when I little thought I should ever be able to accomplish it said the unknown with a singular smile and I made some others also which I hope I may fulfil in due season	99.39590391025409
Although Sinbad pronounced these words with much calmness his eyes gave forth gleams of extraordinary ferocity	658.552044796972
You have suffered a great deal sir said Franz inquiringly	248.44725271829637
Sinbad started and looked fixedly at him as he replied What makes you suppose so	96.87737115954165
Everything answered Franzyour voice your look your pallid complexion and even the life you lead	204.95244214429152
II live the happiest life possible the real life of a pasha	112.2955980255254
I am king of all creation	43681.459851634114
I am pleased with one place and stay there I get tired of it and leave it I am free as a bird and have wings like one my attendants obey my slightest wish	192.96432550730395
Sometimes I amuse myself by delivering some bandit or criminal from the bonds of the law	157.96271328994018
Then I have my mode of dispensing justice silent and sure without respite or appeal which condemns or pardons and which no one sees	730.0957709786779
Ah if you had tasted my life you would not desire any other and would never return to the world unless you had some great project to accomplish there	86.41933057191783
The unknown fixed on the young man one of those looks which penetrate into the depth of the heart and thoughts	90.48440008321415
Because replied Franz you seem to me like a man who persecuted by society has a fearful account to settle with it	96.52373120170904
Ah responded Sinbad laughing with his singular laugh which displayed his white and sharp teeth	153.93056103526126
Such as you see me I am a sort of philosopher and one day perhaps I shall go to Paris to rival Monsieur Appert and the man in the little blue cloak	85.28323571705461
And will that be the first time you ever took that journey	156.1053709530774
I must seem to you by no means curious but I assure you that it is not my fault I have delayed it so longit will happen one day or the other	63.9092409476208
And do you propose to make this journey very shortly	432.49684158478186
I do not know it depends on circumstances which depend on certain arrangements	1055.6893492504848
I should like to be there at the time you come and I will endeavor to repay you as far as lies in my power for your liberal hospitality displayed to me at Monte Cristo	68.86861853472801
I should avail myself of your offer with pleasure replied the host but unfortunately if I go there it will be in all probability incognito	108.23468545119422
The supper appeared to have been supplied solely for Franz for the unknown scarcely touched one or two dishes of the splendid banquet to which his guest did ample justice	335.0780489960826
Then Ali brought on the dessert or rather took the baskets from the hands of the statues and placed them on the table	69.92574570016336
Between the two baskets he placed a small silver cup with a silver cover	57.177359614994344
The care with which Ali placed this cup on the table roused Franzs curiosity	457.82522209587853
He raised the cover and saw a kind of greenish paste something like preserved angelica but which was perfectly unknown to him	246.69570211164518
He replaced the lid as ignorant of what the cup contained as he was before he had looked at it and then casting his eyes towards his host he saw him smile at his disappointment	80.84176815375729
You can not guess said he what there is in that small vase can you	142.66033965835342
Well then that green preserve is nothing less than the ambrosia which Hebe served at the table of Jupiter	202.09679886561267
But replied Franz this ambrosia no doubt in passing through mortal hands has lost its heavenly appellation and assumed a human name in vulgar phrase what may you term this composition for which to tell the truth I do not feel any particular desire	214.69861735031614
Ah thus it is that our material origin is revealed cried Sinbad we frequently pass so near to happiness without seeing without regarding it or if we do see and regard it yet without recognizing it	505.8732685758198
Are you a man for the substantials and is gold your god taste this and the mines of Peru Guzerat and Golconda are opened to you	597.3691005772129
Are you a man of imaginationa poet taste this and the boundaries of possibility disappear the fields of infinite space open to you you advance free in heart free in mind into the boundless realms of unfettered reverie	813.1688122800273
Are you ambitious and do you seek after the greatnesses of the earth taste this and in an hour you will be a king not a king of a petty kingdom hidden in some corner of Europe like France Spain or England but king of the world king of the universe king of creation without bowing at the feet of Satan you will be king and master of all the kingdoms of the earth	131.8038810741944
Is it not tempting what I offer you and is it not an easy thing since it is only to do thus look	57.06899533748007
At these words he uncovered the small cup which contained the substance so lauded took a teaspoonful of the magic sweetmeat raised it to his lips and swallowed it slowly with his eyes half shut and his head bent backwards	164.3655778314986
Franz did not disturb him whilst he absorbed his favorite sweetmeat but when he had finished he inquired	199.47420944383447
What then is this precious stuff	40800.10032502567
Did you ever hear he replied of the Old Man of the Mountain who attempted to assassinate Philippe Auguste	918.8306325966811
Well you know he reigned over a rich valley which was overhung by the mountain whence he derived his picturesque name	284.56128508843574
In this valley were magnificent gardens planted by HassenbenSabah and in these gardens isolated pavilions	2749.2677038344123
Into these pavilions he admitted the elect and there says Marco Polo gave them to eat a certain herb which transported them to Paradise in the midst of everblooming shrubs everripe fruit and everlovely virgins	724.9069317668553
What these happy persons took for reality was but a dream but it was a dream so soft so voluptuous so enthralling that they sold themselves body and soul to him who gave it to them and obedient to his orders as to those of a deity struck down the designated victim died in torture without a murmur believing that the death they underwent was but a quick transition to that life of delights of which the holy herb now before you had given them a slight foretaste	248.12535574366257
Then cried Franz it is hashish I know thatby name at least	829.462290298535
That is it precisely Signor Aladdin it is hashishthe purest and most unadulterated hashish of Alexandriathe hashish of AbouGor the celebrated maker the only man the man to whom there should be built a palace inscribed with these words A grateful world to the dealer in happiness	481.6326849201851
Do you know said Franz I have a very great inclination to judge for myself of the truth or exaggeration of your eulogies	138.6131561594506
Judge for yourself Signor Aladdinjudge but do not confine yourself to one trial	92.93582777909484
Like everything else we must habituate the senses to a fresh impression gentle or violent sad or joyous	451.12443554520274
There is a struggle in nature against this divine substancein nature which is not made for joy and clings to pain	362.98666315857366
Nature subdued must yield in the combat the dream must succeed to reality and then the dream reigns supreme then the dream becomes life and life becomes the dream	409.7733605778657
But what changes occur It is only by comparing the pains of actual being with the joys of the assumed existence that you would desire to live no longer but to dream thus forever	164.21154180731014
When you return to this mundane sphere from your visionary world you would seem to leave a Neapolitan spring for a Lapland winterto quit paradise for earthheaven for hell Taste the hashish guest of minetaste the hashish	1553.552735783409
Franzs only reply was to take a teaspoonful of the marvellous preparation about as much in quantity as his host had eaten and lift it to his mouth	242.8914025336838
Diable he said after having swallowed the divine preserve	1569.4857734737268
I do not know if the result will be as agreeable as you describe but the thing does not appear to me as palatable as you say	57.932818618569826
Because your palate his not yet been attuned to the sublimity of the substances it flavors	562.344461364504
Tell me the first time you tasted oysters tea porter truffles and sundry other dainties which you now adore did you like them Could you comprehend how the Romans stuffed their pheasants with assaftida and the Chinese eat swallows nests Eh no Well it is the same with hashish only eat for a week and nothing in the world will seem to you to equal the delicacy of its flavor which now appears to you flat and distasteful	468.81498987522747
Let us now go into the adjoining chamber which is your apartment and Ali will bring us coffee and pipes	126.86341436296051
They both arose and while he who called himself Sinbadand whom we have occasionally named so that we might like his guest have some title by which to distinguish himgave some orders to the servant Franz entered still another apartment	352.8068816570177
It was simply yet richly furnished	1168.3818030965365
It was round and a large divan completely encircled it	823.9621808930456
Divan walls ceiling floor were all covered with magnificent skins as soft and downy as the richest carpets there were heavymaned lionskins from Atlas striped tigerskins from Bengal pantherskins from the Cape spotted beautifully like those that appeared to Dante bearskins from Siberia foxskins from Norway and so on and all these skins were strewn in profusion one on the other so that it seemed like walking over the most mossy turf or reclining on the most luxurious bed	581.2568945836858
Both laid themselves down on the divan chibouques with jasmine tubes and amber mouthpieces were within reach and all prepared so that there was no need to smoke the same pipe twice	360.4504987101955
Each of them took one which Ali lighted and then retired to prepare the coffee	271.0094283362456
There was a moments silence during which Sinbad gave himself up to thoughts that seemed to occupy him incessantly even in the midst of his conversation and Franz abandoned himself to that mute reverie into which we always sink when smoking excellent tobacco which seems to remove with its fume all the troubles of the mind and to give the smoker in exchange all the visions of the soul	203.85433471777822
How do you take it inquired the unknown in the French or Turkish style strong or weak sugar or none cool or boiling As you please it is ready in all ways	374.1353715203784
I will take it in the Turkish style replied Franz	413.04993232541597
And you are right said his host it shows you have a tendency for an Oriental life	661.6741991987551
Ah those Orientals they are the only men who know how to live	46.96939062156201
As for me he added with one of those singular smiles which did not escape the young man when I have completed my affairs in Paris I shall go and die in the East and should you wish to see me again you must seek me at Cairo Bagdad or Ispahan	53.646698360336266
Ma foi said Franz it would be the easiest thing in the world for I feel eagles wings springing out at my shoulders and with those wings I could make a tour of the world in fourandtwenty hours	141.07314025208714
Ah yes the hashish is beginning its work	965.3644175554799
Well unfurl your wings and fly into superhuman regions fear nothing there is a watch over you and if your wings like those of Icarus melt before the sun we are here to ease your fall	229.41862469052603
He then said something in Arabic to Ali who made a sign of obedience and withdrew but not to any distance	166.91411875670173
As to Franz a strange transformation had taken place in him	102.53631369047781
All the bodily fatigue of the day all the preoccupation of mind which the events of the evening had brought on disappeared as they do at the first approach of sleep when we are still sufficiently conscious to be aware of the coming of slumber	112.03420387178319
His body seemed to acquire an airy lightness his perception brightened in a remarkable manner his senses seemed to redouble their power the horizon continued to expand but it was not the gloomy horizon of vague alarms and which he had seen before he slept but a blue transparent unbounded horizon with all the blue of the ocean all the spangles of the sun all the perfumes of the summer breeze then in the midst of the songs of his sailorssongs so clear and sonorous that they would have made a divine harmony had their notes been taken downhe saw the Island of Monte Cristo no longer as a threatening rock in the midst of the waves but as an oasis in the desert then as his boat drew nearer the songs became louder for an enchanting and mysterious harmony rose to heaven as if some Loreley had decreed to attract a soul thither or Amphion the enchanter intended there to build a city	208.44171500923719
At length the boat touched the shore but without effort without shock as lips touch lips and he entered the grotto amidst continued strains of most delicious melody	627.1175882349535
He descended or rather seemed to descend several steps inhaling the fresh and balmy air like that which may be supposed to reign around the grotto of Circe formed from such perfumes as set the mind adreaming and such fires as burn the very senses and he saw again all he had seen before his sleep from Sinbad his singular host to Ali the mute attendant then all seemed to fade away and become confused before his eyes like the last shadows of the magic lantern before it is extinguished and he was again in the chamber of statues lighted only by one of those pale and antique lamps which watch in the dead of the night over the sleep of pleasure	239.69477649498143
They were the same statues rich in form in attraction and poesy with eyes of fascination smiles of love and bright and flowing hair	627.7966816330602
They were Phryne Cleopatra Messalina those three celebrated courtesans	7451.147087431004
Then among them glided like a pure ray like a Christian angel in the midst of Olympus one of those chaste figures those calm shadows those soft visions which seemed to veil its virgin brow before these marble wantons	253.96299161517734
Then the three statues advanced towards him with looks of love and approached the couch on which he was reposing their feet hidden in their long white tunics their throats bare hair flowing like waves and assuming attitudes which the gods could not resist but which saints withstood and looks inflexible and ardent like those with which the serpent charms the bird and then he gave way before looks that held him in a torturing grasp and delighted his senses as with a voluptuous kiss	347.0319039317711
It seemed to Franz that he closed his eyes and in a last look about him saw the vision of modesty completely veiled and then followed a dream of passion like that promised by the Prophet to the elect	139.05028070423137
Lips of stone turned to flame breasts of ice became like heated lava so that to Franz yielding for the first time to the sway of the drug love was a sorrow and voluptuousness a torture as burning mouths were pressed to his thirsty lips and he was held in cool serpentlike embraces	474.4349292740853
The more he strove against this unhallowed passion the more his senses yielded to its thrall and at length weary of a struggle that taxed his very soul he gave way and sank back breathless and exhausted beneath the kisses of these marble goddesses and the enchantment of his marvellous dream	332.7551104877977
When Franz returned to himself he seemed still to be in a dream	87.36332286181992
He thought himself in a sepulchre into which a ray of sunlight in pity scarcely penetrated	326.4818634950836
He stretched forth his hand and touched stone he rose to his seat and found himself lying on his bournous in a bed of dry heather very soft and odoriferous	216.1133753585716
The vision had fled and as if the statues had been but shadows from the tomb they had vanished at his waking	137.83858689150478
He advanced several paces towards the point whence the light came and to all the excitement of his dream succeeded the calmness of reality	87.15363805599529
He found that he was in a grotto went towards the opening and through a kind of fanlight saw a blue sea and an azure sky	123.22303197800527
The air and water were shining in the beams of the morning sun on the shore the sailors were sitting chatting and laughing and at ten yards from them the boat was at anchor undulating gracefully on the water	174.795822418674
There for some time he enjoyed the fresh breeze which played on his brow and listened to the dash of the waves on the beach that left against the rocks a lace of foam as white as silver	119.06901241503476
He was for some time without reflection or thought for the divine charm which is in the things of nature specially after a fantastic dream then gradually this view of the outer world so calm so pure so grand reminded him of the illusiveness of his vision and once more awakened memory	267.6774313685803
He recalled his arrival on the island his presentation to a smuggler chief a subterranean palace full of splendor an excellent supper and a spoonful of hashish	510.3608314278443
It seemed however even in the very face of open day that at least a year had elapsed since all these things had passed so deep was the impression made in his mind by the dream and so strong a hold had it taken of his imagination	115.69595763946991
Thus every now and then he saw in fancy amid the sailors seated on a rock or undulating in the vessel one of the shadows which had shared his dream with looks and kisses	208.88780167659377
Otherwise his head was perfectly clear and his body refreshed he was free from the slightest headache on the contrary he felt a certain degree of lightness a faculty for absorbing the pure air and enjoying the bright sunshine more vividly than ever	201.66137285275568
He went gayly up to the sailors who rose as soon as they perceived him and the patron accosting him said	73.52725537548258
The Signor Sinbad has left his compliments for your excellency and desires us to express the regret he feels at not being able to take his leave in person but he trusts you will excuse him as very important business calls him to Malaga	207.736838911312
So then Gaetano said Franz this is then all reality there exists a man who has received me in this island entertained me right royally and has departed while I was asleep	270.8707469892506
He exists as certainly as that you may see his small yacht with all her sails spread and if you will use your glass you will in all probability recognize your host in the midst of his crew	99.49227074754003
So saying Gaetano pointed in a direction in which a small vessel was making sail towards the southern point of Corsica	260.6718828514279
Franz adjusted his telescope and directed it towards the yacht	340.8179591881448
At the stern the mysterious stranger was standing up looking towards the shore and holding a spyglass in his hand	110.63812872257236
He was attired as he had been on the previous evening and waved his pockethandkerchief to his guest in token of adieu	94.85582710512803
Franz returned the salute by shaking his handkerchief as an exchange of signals	200.11766859804956
After a second a slight cloud of smoke was seen at the stern of the vessel which rose gracefully as it expanded in the air and then Franz heard a slight report	98.82729772648561
There do you hear observed Gaetano he is bidding you adieu	1466.2371353485653
The young man took his carbine and fired it in the air but without any idea that the noise could be heard at the distance which separated the yacht from the shore	64.33556806123298
What are your excellencys orders inquired Gaetano	2705.0428690850817
In the first place light me a torch	482.7033831175953
Ah yes I understand replied the patron to find the entrance to the enchanted apartment	114.77206737306977
With much pleasure your excellency if it would amuse you and I will get you the torch you ask for	71.459250840993
But I too have had the idea you have and two or three times the same fancy has come over me but I have always given it up	58.2475290894846
Giovanni light a torch he added and give it to his excellency	52.08485866221932
Franz took the lamp and entered the subterranean grotto followed by Gaetano	241.76201705121574
He recognized the place where he had awaked by the bed of heather that was there but it was in vain that he carried his torch all round the exterior surface of the grotto	123.93899149607842
He saw nothing unless that by traces of smoke others had before him attempted the same thing and like him in vain	216.82117742849042
Yet he did not leave a foot of this granite wall as impenetrable as futurity without strict scrutiny he did not see a fissure without introducing the blade of his hunting sword into it or a projecting point on which he did not lean and press in the hopes it would give way	288.6280297855855
All was vain and he lost two hours in his attempts which were at last utterly useless	211.14831438512437
At the end of this time he gave up his search and Gaetano smiled	116.84202855718625
When Franz appeared again on the shore the yacht only seemed like a small white speck on the horizon	197.60062608844626
He looked again through his glass but even then he could not distinguish anything	66.57863224644936
Gaetano reminded him that he had come for the purpose of shooting goats which he had utterly forgotten	185.14587534232876
He took his fowlingpiece and began to hunt over the island with the air of a man who is fulfilling a duty rather than enjoying a pleasure and at the end of a quarter of an hour he had killed a goat and two kids	59.28486781750626
These animals though wild and agile as chamois were too much like domestic goats and Franz could not consider them as game	618.4033293263268
Moreover other ideas much more enthralling occupied his mind	1185.3545112663555
Since the evening before he had really been the hero of one of the tales of the Thousand and One Nights and he was irresistibly attracted towards the grotto	119.9720100611574
Then in spite of the failure of his first search he began a second after having told Gaetano to roast one of the two kids	205.10043089787914
The second visit was a long one and when he returned the kid was roasted and the repast ready	232.37740048558788
Franz was sitting on the spot where he was on the previous evening when his mysterious host had invited him to supper and he saw the little yacht now like a seagull on the wave continuing her flight towards Corsica	138.8395555216535
Why he remarked to Gaetano you told me that Signor Sinbad was going to Malaga while it seems he is in the direction of PortoVecchio	101.79039209433599
Do nt you remember said the patron I told you that among the crew there were two Corsican brigands	166.93363688987483
True and he is going to land them added Franz	507.52597003025176
Ah he is one who fears neither God nor Satan they say and would at any time run fifty leagues out of his course to do a poor devil a service	202.15900006837862
But such services as these might involve him with the authorities of the country in which he practices this kind of philanthropy said Franz	192.76186384655367
And what cares he for that replied Gaetano with a laugh or any authorities He smiles at them	319.77618646243474
Let them try to pursue him Why in the first place his yacht is not a ship but a bird and he would beat any frigate three knots in every nine and if he were to throw himself on the coast why is he not certain of finding friends everywhere	192.60437778770003
It was perfectly clear that the Signor Sinbad Franzs host had the honor of being on excellent terms with the smugglers and bandits along the whole coast of the Mediterranean and so enjoyed exceptional privileges	281.12790536717466
As to Franz he had no longer any inducement to remain at Monte Cristo	64.06555694185664
He had lost all hope of detecting the secret of the grotto he consequently despatched his breakfast and his boat being ready he hastened on board and they were soon under way	176.0250428544252
At the moment the boat began her course they lost sight of the yacht as it disappeared in the gulf of PortoVecchio	140.4397501308261
With it was effaced the last trace of the preceding night and then supper Sinbad hashish statuesall became a dream for Franz	586.637476170579
The boat sailed on all day and all night and next morning when the sun rose they had lost sight of Monte Cristo	40.869381846792145
When Franz had once again set foot on shore he forgot for the moment at least the events which had just passed while he finished his affairs of pleasure at Florence and then thought of nothing but how he should rejoin his companion who was awaiting him at Rome	91.67633908874605
He set out and on the Saturday evening reached the Place de la Douane by the mailcoach	165.02490252547946
An apartment as we have said had been retained beforehand and thus he had but to go to Signor Pastrinis hotel	254.44620384144432
But this was not so easy a matter for the streets were thronged with people and Rome was already a prey to that low and feverish murmur which precedes all great events and at Rome there are four great events in every yearthe Carnival Holy Week Corpus Christi and the Feast of St	485.60058108155596
All the rest of the year the city is in that state of dull apathy between life and death which renders it similar to a kind of station between this world and the nexta sublime spot a restingplace full of poetry and character and at which Franz had already halted five or six times and at each time found it more marvellous and striking	184.19134822289698
At last he made his way through the mob which was continually increasing and getting more and more turbulent and reached the hotel	167.92371147676715
On his first inquiry he was told with the impertinence peculiar to hired hackneycoachmen and innkeepers with their houses full that there was no room for him at the Htel de Londres	136.81945413716792
Then he sent his card to Signor Pastrini and asked for Albert de Morcerf	48.22138635206749
This plan succeeded and Signor Pastrini himself ran to him excusing himself for having made his excellency wait scolding the waiters taking the candlestick from the porter who was ready to pounce on the traveller and was about to lead him to Albert when Morcerf himself appeared	151.99465743063382
The apartment consisted of two small rooms and a parlor	121.30696709285948
The two rooms looked on to the streeta fact which Signor Pastrini commented upon as an inappreciable advantage	1181.8581008874312
The rest of the floor was hired by a very rich gentleman who was supposed to be a Sicilian or Maltese but the host was unable to decide to which of the two nations the traveller belonged	139.6356608250036
Very good signor Pastrini said Franz but we must have some supper instantly and a carriage for tomorrow and the following days	139.37321834134954
As to supper replied the landlord you shall be served immediately but as for the carriage	107.20015934821828
What as to the carriage exclaimed Albert	196.80144551075205
Come come Signor Pastrini no joking we must have a carriage	233.87514703374174
Sir replied the host we will do all in our power to procure you onethis is all I can say	44.73348617818852
And when shall we know inquired Franz	1318.1842569074038
Oh the deuce then we shall pay the more that s all I see plainly enough	92.96443632587174
At Drakes or Aarons one pays twentyfive lire for common days and thirty or thirtyfive lire a day more for Sundays and feast days add five lire a day more for extras that will make forty and there s an end of it	410.0054921266364
I am afraid if we offer them double that we shall not procure a carriage	113.82512414707682
Then they must put horses to mine	110.83178419593052
It is a little worse for the journey but that s no matter	82.21335648880398
Albert looked at Franz like a man who hears a reply he does not understand	34.15983440006446
Do you understand that my dear Franzno horses he said but ca nt we have posthorses	380.42807848089143
They have been all hired this fortnight and there are none left but those absolutely requisite for posting	541.4341917963773
What are we to say to this asked Franz	179.7559476131276
I say that when a thing completely surpasses my comprehension I am accustomed not to dwell on that thing but to pass to another	329.4227788437935
But the carriage and horses said Franz	205.93828119695837
Be easy my dear boy they will come in due season it is only a question of how much shall be charged for them	96.74564377009578
Morcerf then with that delighted philosophy which believes that nothing is impossible to a full purse or welllined pocketbook supped went to bed slept soundly and dreamed he was racing all over Rome at Carnival time in a coach with six horses	478.1194692182408
The next morning Franz woke first and instantly rang the bell	88.0058118416541
The sound had not yet died away when Signor Pastrini himself entered	331.3106014037052
Well excellency said the landlord triumphantly and without waiting for Franz to question him I feared yesterday when I would not promise you anything that you were too latethere is not a single carriage to be hadthat is for the three last days	127.45953203615342
Yes returned Franz for the very three days it is most needed	279.64798183664857
What is the matter said Albert entering no carriage to be had	230.717155396168
Just so returned Franz you have guessed it	56.5929747894444
Well your Eternal City is a nice sort of place	191.96227253066138
That is to say excellency replied Pastrini who was desirous of keeping up the dignity of the capital of the Christian world in the eyes of his guest that there are no carriages to be had from Sunday to Tuesday evening but from now till Sunday you can have fifty if you please	123.21051859659617
Ah that is something said Albert today is Thursday and who knows what may arrive between this and Sunday	242.49120325515946
Ten or twelve thousand travellers will arrive replied Franz which will make it still more difficult	193.23012479640192
My friend said Morcerf let us enjoy the present without gloomy forebodings for the future	255.4480363275497
At least we can have a window	335.4463366405186
Ah a window exclaimed Signor Pastriniutterly impossible there was only one left on the fifth floor of the Doria Palace and that has been let to a Russian prince for twenty sequins a day	216.98177254749893
The two young men looked at each other with an air of stupefaction	9.859239957434829
Well said Franz to Albert do you know what is the best thing we can do It is to pass the Carnival at Venice there we are sure of obtaining gondolas if we can not have carriages	120.02050586739635
Ah the devil no cried Albert I came to Rome to see the Carnival and I will though I see it on stilts	115.05951503154063
We will disguise ourselves as monster pulchinellos or shepherds of the Landes and we shall have complete success	624.2639788886446
Do your excellencies still wish for a carriage from now to Sunday morning	208.40162518673918
Parbleu said Albert do you think we are going to run about on foot in the streets of Rome like lawyers clerks	116.35955526130755
I hasten to comply with your excellencies wishes only I tell you beforehand the carriage will cost you six piastres a day	249.8472486642382
And as I am not a millionaire like the gentleman in the next apartments said Franz I warn you that as I have been four times before at Rome I know the prices of all the carriages we will give you twelve piastres for today tomorrow and the day after and then you will make a good profit	78.11363160796107
But excellencysaid Pastrini still striving to gain his point	99.43231752226475
Now go returned Franz or I shall go myself and bargain with your affettatore who is mine also he is an old friend of mine who has plundered me pretty well already and in the hope of making more out of me he will take a less price than the one I offer you you will lose the preference and that will be your fault	95.27163923498343
Do not give yourselves the trouble excellency returned Signor Pastrini with the smile peculiar to the Italian speculator when he confesses defeat I will do all I can and I hope you will be satisfied	144.08676026848522
And now we understand each other	2.135482766786679
When do you wish the carriage to be here	142.36833311434583
In an hour it will be at the door	11.22079091324363
An hour after the vehicle was at the door it was a hack conveyance which was elevated to the rank of a private carriage in honor of the occasion but in spite of its humble exterior the young men would have thought themselves happy to have secured it for the last three days of the Carnival	69.85198128296861
Excellency cried the cicerone seeing Franz approach the window shall I bring the carriage nearer to the palace	248.01097336863728
Accustomed as Franz was to the Italian phraseology his first impulse was to look round him but these words were addressed to him	108.72194710952255
Franz was the excellency the vehicle was the carriage and the Htel de Londres was the palace	80.68711810186966
The genius for laudation characteristic of the race was in that phrase	135.5322070515902
Franz and Albert descended the carriage approached the palace their excellencies stretched their legs along the seats the cicerone sprang into the seat behind	340.9761768797355
Where do your excellencies wish to go asked he	47.54859222006081
To Saint Peters first and then to the Colosseum returned Albert	216.10366234367254
But Albert did not know that it takes a day to see Saint Peters and a month to study it	204.19629943212354
The day was passed at Saint Peters alone	2000.309527981306
Suddenly the daylight began to fade away Franz took out his watchit was halfpast four	670.5386474384068
They returned to the hotel at the door Franz ordered the coachman to be ready at eight	59.51672871630479
He wished to show Albert the Colosseum by moonlight as he had shown him Saint Peters by daylight	433.642480591088
When we show a friend a city one has already visited we feel the same pride as when we point out a woman whose lover we have been	227.78080518075538
He was to leave the city by the Porta del Popolo skirt the outer wall and reenter by the Porta San Giovanni thus they would behold the Colosseum without finding their impressions dulled by first looking on the Capitol the Forum the Arch of Septimus Severus the Temple of Antoninus and Faustina and the Via Sacra	534.6147667833357
Signor Pastrini had promised them a banquet he gave them a tolerable repast	490.8167840093568
At the end of the dinner he entered in person	240.67940228510017
Franz thought that he came to hear his dinner praised and began accordingly but at the first words he was interrupted	307.63256575069556
Excellency said Pastrini I am delighted to have your approbation but it was not for that I came	56.80506182308507
Did you come to tell us you have procured a carriage asked Albert lighting his cigar	179.24734623812944
No and your excellencies will do well not to think of that any longer at Rome things can or can not be done when you are told anything can not be done there is an end of it	75.79593627260661
It is much more convenient at Pariswhen anything can not be done you pay double and it is done directly	178.7681289526868
That is what all the French say returned Signor Pastrini somewhat piqued for that reason I do not understand why they travel	266.6816575041083
But said Albert emitting a volume of smoke and balancing his chair on its hind legs only madmen or blockheads like us ever do travel	422.8004167079735
Men in their senses do not quit their hotel in the Rue du Helder their walk on the Boulevard de Gand and the Caf de Paris	41.71745508736035
It is of course understood that Albert resided in the aforesaid street appeared every day on the fashionable walk and dined frequently at the only restaurant where you can really dine that is if you are on good terms with its waiters	218.6694747855735
Signor Pastrini remained silent a short time it was evident that he was musing over this answer which did not seem very clear	69.53490307658628
But said Franz in his turn interrupting his hosts meditations you had some motive for coming here may I beg to know what it was	165.908370626449
Ah yes you have ordered your carriage at eight oclock precisely	76.71398429444102
You have told your coachman to leave the city by the Porta del Popolo to drive round the walls and reenter by the Porta San Giovanni	124.68756068263107
Very dangerous to say the least	180.22073333977033
On account of the famous Luigi Vampa	1939.8966666749202
Pray who may this famous Luigi Vampa be inquired Albert he may be very famous at Rome but I can assure you he is quite unknown at Paris	148.36185051468513
What do you not know him	82.57880360832117
You have never heard his name	25.31278622174334
Well then he is a bandit compared to whom the Decesaris and the Gasparones were mere children	705.1786084783066
Now then Albert cried Franz here is a bandit for you at last	56.35118708420245
I forewarn you Signor Pastrini that I shall not believe one word of what you are going to tell us having told you this begin	46.24314941468451
Once upon a time Well go on	170.28481050665573
Signor Pastrini turned toward Franz who seemed to him the more reasonable of the two we must do him justicehe had had a great many Frenchmen in his house but had never been able to comprehend them	102.23107550081086
Excellency said he gravely addressing Franz if you look upon me as a liar it is useless for me to say anything it was for your interest I	56.070051009864066
Albert does not say you are a liar Signor Pastrini said Franz but that he will not believe what you are going to tell usbut I will believe all you say so proceed	97.28033070197071
But if your excellency doubt my veracity	538.4775899974953
Signor Pastrini returned Franz you are more susceptible than Cassandra who was a prophetess and yet no one believed her while you at least are sure of the credence of half your audience	187.95864133171423
Come sit down and tell us all about this Signor Vampa	62.76003627893821
I had told your excellency he is the most famous bandit we have had since the days of Mastrilla	161.7472659382293
Well what has this bandit to do with the order I have given the coachman to leave the city by the Porta del Popolo and to reenter by the Porta San Giovanni	74.19814249920445
This replied Signor Pastrini that you will go out by one but I very much doubt your returning by the other	76.52188943799008
Because after nightfall you are not safe fifty yards from the gates	167.84907275631747
On your honor is that true cried Albert	242.90417869985603
Count returned Signor Pastrini hurt at Alberts repeated doubts of the truth of his assertions I do not say this to you but to your companion who knows Rome and knows too that these things are not to be laughed at	95.65394952855507
My dear fellow said Albert turning to Franz here is an admirable adventure we will fill our carriage with pistols blunderbusses and doublebarrelled guns	207.79082367870666
Luigi Vampa comes to take us and we take himwe bring him back to Rome and present him to his holiness the Pope who asks how he can repay so great a service then we merely ask for a carriage and a pair of horses and we see the Carnival in the carriage and doubtless the Roman people will crown us at the Capitol and proclaim us like Curtius and Horatius Cocles the preservers of their country	235.4741188185786
Whilst Albert proposed this scheme Signor Pastrinis face assumed an expression impossible to describe	707.8013759650083
And pray asked Franz where are these pistols blunderbusses and other deadly weapons with which you intend filling the carriage	347.5621071454645
Not out of my armory for at Terracina I was plundered even of my huntingknife	451.21505557438246
I shared the same fate at Aquapendente	15861.115907556274
Do you know Signor Pastrini said Albert lighting a second cigar at the first that this practice is very convenient for bandits and that it seems to be due to an arrangement of their own	128.31829561599136
Doubtless Signor Pastrini found this pleasantry compromising for he only answered half the question and then he spoke to Franz as the only one likely to listen with attention	205.4713696201323
Your excellency knows that it is not customary to defend yourself when attacked by bandits	173.2181578159037
What cried Albert whose courage revolted at the idea of being plundered tamely not make any resistance	265.8722276210053
No for it would be useless	285.44024485701965
What could you do against a dozen bandits who spring out of some pit ruin or aqueduct and level their pieces at you	735.6939231857642
The innkeeper turned to Franz with an air that seemed to say Your friend is decidedly mad	73.95355659873373
My dear Albert returned Franz your answer is sublime and worthy the Let him die of Corneille only when Horace made that answer the safety of Rome was concerned but as for us it is only to gratify a whim and it would be ridiculous to risk our lives for so foolish a motive	205.33816472595916
Albert poured himself out a glass of lacryma Christi which he sipped at intervals muttering some unintelligible words	641.9991988036668
Well Signor Pastrini said Franz now that my companion is quieted and you have seen how peaceful my intentions are tell me who is this Luigi Vampa	186.591629244956
Is he a shepherd or a noblemanyoung or oldtall or short Describe him in order that if we meet him by chance like Jean Sbogar or Lara we may recognize him	406.5963250828255
You could not apply to anyone better able to inform you on all these points for I knew him when he was a child and one day that I fell into his hands going from Ferentino to Alatri he fortunately for me recollected me and set me free not only without ransom but made me a present of a very splendid watch and related his history to me	155.15729921227327
Let us see the watch said Albert	69.26158904864785
Signor Pastrini drew from his fob a magnificent Brguet bearing the name of its maker of Parisian manufacture and a counts coronet	509.22511784219495
Peste returned Albert I compliment you on it I have its fellowhe took his watch from his waistcoat pocketand it cost me 3000 francs	230.59022132650838
Let us hear the history said Franz motioning Signor Pastrini to seat himself	230.68716071046407
Your excellencies permit it asked the host	21.72996401355698
Pardieu cried Albert you are not a preacher to remain standing	342.066242269777
The host sat down after having made each of them a respectful bow which meant that he was ready to tell them all they wished to know concerning Luigi Vampa	105.82027023318682
You tell me said Franz at the moment Signor Pastrini was about to open his mouth that you knew Luigi Vampa when he was a childhe is still a young man then	88.55981570266303
A young man he is only twoandtwentyhe will gain himself a reputation	551.4314727509962
What do you think of that Albertat twoandtwenty to be thus famous	1548.7838671410464
Yes and at his age Alexander Csar and Napoleon who have all made some noise in the world were quite behind him	203.027553575886
So continued Franz the hero of this history is only twoandtwenty	160.17924166347774
Of the middle heightabout the same stature as his excellency returned the host pointing to Albert	284.8006832322266
Thanks for the comparison said Albert with a bow	32.21900614691293
Go on Signor Pastrini continued Franz smiling at his friends susceptibility	238.90100575685233
To what class of society does he belong	218.14388828552788
He was a shepherdboy attached to the farm of the Count of SanFelice situated between Palestrina and the Lake of Gabri he was born at Pampinara and entered the counts service when he was five years old his father was also a shepherd who owned a small flock and lived by the wool and the milk which he sold at Rome	144.9498369457405
When quite a child the little Vampa displayed a most extraordinary precocity	1115.308890159004
One day when he was seven years old he came to the curate of Palestrina and asked to be taught to read it was somewhat difficult for he could not quit his flock but the good curate went every day to say mass at a little hamlet too poor to pay a priest and which having no other name was called Borgo he told Luigi that he might meet him on his return and that then he would give him a lesson warning him that it would be short and that he must profit as much as possible by it	118.8353456371291
Every day Luigi led his flock to graze on the road that leads from Palestrina to Borgo every day at nine oclock in the morning the priest and the boy sat down on a bank by the wayside and the little shepherd took his lesson out of the priests breviary	101.3483412627506
At the end of three months he had learned to read	37.582290871667354
This was not enoughhe must now learn to write	382.3852228931641
The priest had a writing teacher at Rome make three alphabetsone large one middling and one small and pointed out to him that by the help of a sharp instrument he could trace the letters on a slate and thus learn to write	348.6824464011532
The same evening when the flock was safe at the farm the little Luigi hastened to the smith at Palestrina took a large nail heated and sharpened it and formed a sort of stylus	410.9163028400228
The next morning he gathered an armful of pieces of slate and began	267.8748290662375
At the end of three months he had learned to write	36.8527329127165
The curate astonished at his quickness and intelligence made him a present of pens paper and a penknife	300.47360902983655
This demanded new effort but nothing compared to the first at the end of a week he wrote as well with this pen as with the stylus	75.15381401002197
The curate related the incident to the Count of SanFelice who sent for the little shepherd made him read and write before him ordered his attendant to let him eat with the domestics and to give him two piastres a month	121.3671694893947
With this Luigi purchased books and pencils	693.7667678857132
He applied his imitative powers to everything and like Giotto when young he drew on his slate sheep houses and trees	601.6291642855305
Then with his knife he began to carve all sorts of objects in wood it was thus that Pinelli the famous sculptor had commenced	349.5055381068579
A girl of six or seventhat is a little younger than Vampatended sheep on a farm near Palestrina she was an orphan born at Valmontone and was named Teresa	861.1027266232567
The two children met sat down near each other let their flocks mingle together played laughed and conversed together in the evening they separated the Count of SanFelices flock from those of Baron Cervetri and the children returned to their respective farms promising to meet the next morning	258.2127756206882
The next day they kept their word and thus they grew up together	114.25820106999437
Vampa was twelve and Teresa eleven	8763.628635229581
And yet their natural disposition revealed itself	1008.9212238500261
Beside his taste for the fine arts which Luigi had carried as far as he could in his solitude he was given to alternating fits of sadness and enthusiasm was often angry and capricious and always sarcastic	252.80099979947488
None of the lads of Pampinara Palestrina or Valmontone had been able to gain any influence over him or even to become his companion	129.42416802107567
His disposition always inclined to exact concessions rather than to make them kept him aloof from all friendships	719.7011628407165
Teresa alone ruled by a look a word a gesture this impetuous character which yielded beneath the hand of a woman and which beneath the hand of a man might have broken but could never have been bended	104.78160752678937
Teresa was lively and gay but coquettish to excess	2395.0516050126716
The two piastres that Luigi received every month from the Count of SanFelices steward and the price of all the little carvings in wood he sold at Rome were expended in earrings necklaces and gold hairpins	325.9323099212629
So that thanks to her friends generosity Teresa was the most beautiful and the bestattired peasant near Rome	660.4323917626914
The two children grew up together passing all their time with each other and giving themselves up to the wild ideas of their different characters	101.82018403263146
Thus in all their dreams their wishes and their conversations Vampa saw himself the captain of a vessel general of an army or governor of a province	249.64812935571845
Teresa saw herself rich superbly attired and attended by a train of liveried domestics	544.1079828834149
Then when they had thus passed the day in building castles in the air they separated their flocks and descended from the elevation of their dreams to the reality of their humble position	150.21150208006304
One day the young shepherd told the counts steward that he had seen a wolf come out of the Sabine mountains and prowl around his flock	252.80268301513235
The steward gave him a gun this was what Vampa longed for	879.484920439267
This gun had an excellent barrel made at Brescia and carrying a ball with the precision of an English rifle but one day the count broke the stock and had then cast the gun aside	253.9317963390622
This however was nothing to a sculptor like Vampa he examined the broken stock calculated what change it would require to adapt the gun to his shoulder and made a fresh stock so beautifully carved that it would have fetched fifteen or twenty piastres had he chosen to sell it	275.05409552790786
But nothing could be farther from his thoughts	66.33750839649353
For a long time a gun had been the young mans greatest ambition	219.8384365243808
In every country where independence has taken the place of liberty the first desire of a manly heart is to possess a weapon which at once renders him capable of defence or attack and by rendering its owner terrible often makes him feared	188.59745436163985
From this moment Vampa devoted all his leisure time to perfecting himself in the use of his precious weapon he purchased powder and ball and everything served him for a markthe trunk of some old and mossgrown olivetree that grew on the Sabine mountains the fox as he quitted his earth on some marauding excursion the eagle that soared above their heads and thus he soon became so expert that Teresa overcame the terror she at first felt at the report and amused herself by watching him direct the ball wherever he pleased with as much accuracy as if he placed it by hand	398.6648125542583
One evening a wolf emerged from a pinewood near which they were usually stationed but the wolf had scarcely advanced ten yards ere he was dead	168.69611287782934
Proud of this exploit Vampa took the dead animal on his shoulders and carried him to the farm	97.52843747497226
These exploits had gained Luigi considerable reputation	12775.336061198168
The man of superior abilities always finds admirers go where he will	1354.5013944284412
He was spoken of as the most adroit the strongest and the most courageous contadino for ten leagues around and although Teresa was universally allowed to be the most beautiful girl of the Sabines no one had ever spoken to her of love because it was known that she was beloved by Vampa	188.24268735188556
And yet the two young people had never declared their affection they had grown together like two trees whose roots are mingled whose branches intertwined and whose intermingled perfume rises to the heavens	647.442310846612
Only their wish to see each other had become a necessity and they would have preferred death to a days separation	190.79706221872058
Teresa was sixteen and Vampa seventeen	200453.15879500424
About this time a band of brigands that had established itself in the Lepini mountains began to be much spoken of	275.3279114298998
The brigands have never been really extirpated from the neighborhood of Rome	223.50096280424384
Sometimes a chief is wanted but when a chief presents himself he rarely has to wait long for a band of followers	335.24681900088234
The celebrated Cucumetto pursued in the Abruzzo driven out of the kingdom of Naples where he had carried on a regular war had crossed the Garigliano like Manfred and had taken refuge on the banks of the Amasine between Sonnino and Juperno	236.3625103565204
He strove to collect a band of followers and followed the footsteps of Decesaris and Gasparone whom he hoped to surpass	248.7942510097592
Many young men of Palestrina Frascati and Pampinara had disappeared	852.5274630456572
Their disappearance at first caused much disquietude but it was soon known that they had joined Cucumetto	251.6612082989111
After some time Cucumetto became the object of universal attention the most extraordinary traits of ferocious daring and brutality were related of him	507.20668447240297
One day he carried off a young girl the daughter of a surveyor of Frosinone	105.61824495089293
The bandits laws are positive a young girl belongs first to him who carries her off then the rest draw lots for her and she is abandoned to their brutality until death relieves her sufferings	283.9238709261969
When their parents are sufficiently rich to pay a ransom a messenger is sent to negotiate the prisoner is hostage for the security of the messenger should the ransom be refused the prisoner is irrevocably lost	307.2237275996897
The young girls lover was in Cucumettos troop his name was Carlini	1740.1689696921512
When she recognized her lover the poor girl extended her arms to him and believed herself safe but Carlini felt his heart sink for he but too well knew the fate that awaited her	183.51646645739942
However as he was a favorite with Cucumetto as he had for three years faithfully served him and as he had saved his life by shooting a dragoon who was about to cut him down he hoped the chief would have pity on him	100.56434537347856
He took Cucumetto one side while the young girl seated at the foot of a huge pine that stood in the centre of the forest made a veil of her picturesque headdress to hide her face from the lascivious gaze of the bandits	80.48580952180069
There he told the chief allhis affection for the prisoner their promises of mutual fidelity and how every night since he had been near they had met in some neighboring ruins	331.1735539347401
It so happened that night that Cucumetto had sent Carlini to a village so that he had been unable to go to the place of meeting	63.605656742756025
Cucumetto had been there however by accident as he said and had carried the maiden off	170.23490311954973
Carlini besought his chief to make an exception in Ritas favor as her father was rich and could pay a large ransom	204.02716617662833
Cucumetto seemed to yield to his friends entreaties and bade him find a shepherd to send to Ritas father at Frosinone	383.73031873619146
Carlini flew joyfully to Rita telling her she was saved and bidding her write to her father to inform him what had occurred and that her ransom was fixed at three hundred piastres	172.13449452503426
Twelve hours delay was all that was grantedthat is until nine the next morning	372.19639046728895
The instant the letter was written Carlini seized it and hastened to the plain to find a messenger	275.76742019337416
He found a young shepherd watching his flock	668.1647673607949
The natural messengers of the bandits are the shepherds who live between the city and the mountains between civilized and savage life	390.78366692771385
The boy undertook the commission promising to be in Frosinone in less than an hour	106.64500496846611
Carlini returned anxious to see his mistress and announce the joyful intelligence	477.0112814820222
He found the troop in the glade supping off the provisions exacted as contributions from the peasants but his eye vainly sought Rita and Cucumetto among them	920.7877790053377
He inquired where they were and was answered by a burst of laughter	51.0288672128777
A cold perspiration burst from every pore and his hair stood on end	58.52901442415338
One of the bandits rose and offered him a glass filled with Orvietto saying To the health of the brave Cucumetto and the fair Rita	189.56283355253126
At this moment Carlini heard a womans cry he divined the truth seized the glass broke it across the face of him who presented it and rushed towards the spot whence the cry came	113.86331922867788
After a hundred yards he turned the corner of the thicket he found Rita senseless in the arms of Cucumetto	137.08734304162326
At the sight of Carlini Cucumetto rose a pistol in each hand	234.56260772517874
The two brigands looked at each other for a momentthe one with a smile of lasciviousness on his lips the other with the pallor of death on his brow	57.13982186813332
A terrible battle between the two men seemed imminent but by degrees Carlinis features relaxed his hand which had grasped one of the pistols in his belt fell to his side	170.44613425040706
Well said Cucumetto have you executed your commission	805.9718912698976
At nine oclock tomorrow Ritas father will be here with the money	30.838683275413075
It is well in the meantime we will have a merry night this young girl is charming and does credit to your taste	142.93258674433466
Now as I am not egotistical we will return to our comrades and draw lots for her	174.01041704061677
You have determined then to abandon her to the common law said Carlini	329.8510454159703
Why should an exception be made in her favor	79.50347479337738
What right have you any more than the rest to ask for an exception	41.00312484402458
But never mind continued Cucumetto laughing sooner or later your turn will come	272.36188189630593
Now then said Cucumetto advancing towards the other bandits are you coming	103.8104082778185
Cucumetto departed without losing sight of Carlini for doubtless he feared lest he should strike him unawares but nothing betrayed a hostile design on Carlinis part	470.54424612197454
He was standing his arms folded near Rita who was still insensible	364.63384288458974
Cucumetto fancied for a moment the young man was about to take her in his arms and fly but this mattered little to him now Rita had been his and as for the money three hundred piastres distributed among the band was so small a sum that he cared little about it	110.07955981689916
He continued to follow the path to the glade but to his great surprise Carlini arrived almost as soon as himself	236.91045182982356
Let us draw lots let us draw lots cried all the brigands when they saw the chief	150.13892093583397
Their demand was fair and the chief inclined his head in sign of acquiescence	227.89599154674087
The eyes of all shone fiercely as they made their demand and the red light of the fire made them look like demons	174.67968230681964
The names of all including Carlini were placed in a hat and the youngest of the band drew forth a ticket the ticket bore the name of Diavolaccio	288.16267267483573
He was the man who had proposed to Carlini the health of their chief and to whom Carlini replied by breaking the glass across his face	157.87300351908203
A large wound extending from the temple to the mouth was bleeding profusely	596.2738505039706
Diavolaccio seeing himself thus favored by fortune burst into a loud laugh	57.86514802791811
Captain said he just now Carlini would not drink your health when I proposed it to him propose mine to him and let us see if he will be more condescending to you than to me	102.19188760874556
Everyone expected an explosion on Carlinis part but to their great surprise he took a glass in one hand and a flask in the other and filling it	113.31714309441489
Your health Diavolaccio said he calmly and he drank it off without his hand trembling in the least	90.0767172928396
Then sitting down by the fire My supper said he my expedition has given me an appetite	182.0552700924175
Well done Carlini cried the brigands that is acting like a good fellow and they all formed a circle round the fire while Diavolaccio disappeared	256.6692533434934
Carlini ate and drank as if nothing had happened	14.569901354642404
The bandits looked on with astonishment at this singular conduct until they heard footsteps	315.36167382466994
They turned round and saw Diavolaccio bearing the young girl in his arms	129.56855764056976
Her head hung back and her long hair swept the ground	196.4369248784482
As they entered the circle the bandits could perceive by the firelight the unearthly pallor of the young girl and of Diavolaccio	178.8803328870947
This apparition was so strange and so solemn that everyone rose with the exception of Carlini who remained seated and ate and drank calmly	198.12667509737474
Diavolaccio advanced amidst the most profound silence and laid Rita at the captains feet	249.96630066159452
Then everyone could understand the cause of the unearthly pallor in the young girl and the bandit	57.62170490441856
A knife was plunged up to the hilt in Ritas left breast	155.59095794015602
Everyone looked at Carlini the sheath at his belt was empty	336.1834502534574
Ah ah said the chief I now understand why Carlini stayed behind	1124.8738019910745
All savage natures appreciate a desperate deed	3386.4783770385807
No other of the bandits would perhaps have done the same but they all understood what Carlini had done	151.71402732327044
Now then cried Carlini rising in his turn and approaching the corpse his hand on the butt of one of his pistols does anyone dispute the possession of this woman with me	52.5746582971485
No returned the chief she is thine	2882.5546574456403
Carlini raised her in his arms and carried her out of the circle of firelight	102.31851012200593
Cucumetto placed his sentinels for the night and the bandits wrapped themselves in their cloaks and lay down before the fire	79.6369168677467
At midnight the sentinel gave the alarm and in an instant all were on the alert	122.68158486413847
It was Ritas father who brought his daughters ransom in person	242.72361560516399
Here said he to Cucumetto here are three hundred piastres give me back my child	97.7691482148302
But the chief without taking the money made a sign to him to follow	25.64319528793099
They both advanced beneath the trees through whose branches streamed the moonlight	519.9309773982079
Cucumetto stopped at last and pointed to two persons grouped at the foot of a tree	100.20376024773107
There said he demand thy child of Carlini he will tell thee what has become of her and he returned to his companions	74.07565363236878
The old man remained motionless he felt that some great and unforeseen misfortune hung over his head	123.5928554853572
At length he advanced toward the group the meaning of which he could not comprehend	64.54241392782568
As he approached Carlini raised his head and the forms of two persons became visible to the old mans eyes	31.53209808682
A woman lay on the ground her head resting on the knees of a man who was seated by her as he raised his head the womans face became visible	37.20894095341863
The old man recognized his child and Carlini recognized the old man	112.66786615496426
I expected thee said the bandit to Ritas father	1967.146551425367
Wretch returned the old man what hast thou done and he gazed with terror on Rita pale and bloody a knife buried in her bosom	146.59117809005198
A ray of moonlight poured through the trees and lighted up the face of the dead	20.96202934999732
Cucumetto had violated thy daughter said the bandit I loved her therefore I slew her for she would have served as the sport of the whole band	139.78844162118293
The old man spoke not and grew pale as death	132.9895263942451
Now continued Carlini if I have done wrongly avenge her and withdrawing the knife from the wound in Ritas bosom he held it out to the old man with one hand while with the other he tore open his vest	83.16412477077573
Thou hast done well returned the old man in a hoarse voice embrace me my son	41.35270542301277
Carlini threw himself sobbing like a child into the arms of his mistresss father	92.34748167431574
These were the first tears the man of blood had ever wept	111.54928036537581
Now said the old man aid me to bury my child	98.39886040359067
Carlini fetched two pickaxes and the father and the lover began to dig at the foot of a huge oak beneath which the young girl was to repose	54.380460181718796
When the grave was formed the father embraced her first and then the lover afterwards one taking the head the other the feet they placed her in the grave	174.78865556072122
Then they knelt on each side of the grave and said the prayers of the dead	32.03262304744221
Then when they had finished they cast the earth over the corpse until the grave was filled	121.20902983659828
Then extending his hand the old man said I thank you my son and now leave me alone	44.3736388541585
Carlini obeyed rejoined his comrades folded himself in his cloak and soon appeared to sleep as soundly as the rest	68.89619169161196
It had been resolved the night before to change their encampment	534.3413818603105
An hour before daybreak Cucumetto aroused his men and gave the word to march	221.05650488289862
But Carlini would not quit the forest without knowing what had become of Ritas father	152.32677684775254
He went toward the place where he had left him	11.53909536386578
He found the old man suspended from one of the branches of the oak which shaded his daughters grave	183.13668874475925
He then took an oath of bitter vengeance over the dead body of the one and the tomb of the other	55.55831121914367
But he was unable to complete this oath for two days afterwards in an encounter with the Roman carbineers Carlini was killed	173.1412882594864
There was some surprise however that as he was with his face to the enemy he should have received a ball between his shoulders	54.796696556347676
That astonishment ceased when one of the brigands remarked to his comrades that Cucumetto was stationed ten paces in Carlinis rear when he fell	267.3661773142555
On the morning of the departure from the forest of Frosinone he had followed Carlini in the darkness and heard this oath of vengeance and like a wise man anticipated it	137.91029706276132
They told ten other stories of this bandit chief each more singular than the other	230.79688725752993
Thus from Fondi to Perusia everyone trembles at the name of Cucumetto	503.4052497236752
These narratives were frequently the theme of conversation between Luigi and Teresa	429.5568576809928
The young girl trembled very much at hearing the stories but Vampa reassured her with a smile tapping the butt of his good fowlingpiece which threw its ball so well and if that did not restore her courage he pointed to a crow perched on some dead branch took aim touched the trigger and the bird fell dead at the foot of the tree	213.29044170876145
Time passed on and the two young people had agreed to be married when Vampa should be twenty and Teresa nineteen years of age	133.0352649306376
They were both orphans and had only their employers leave to ask which had been already sought and obtained	326.80372076259613
One day when they were talking over their plans for the future they heard two or three reports of firearms and then suddenly a man came out of the wood near which the two young persons used to graze their flocks and hurried towards them	94.93850811528318
When he came within hearing he exclaimed	96.9040592209105
I am pursued can you conceal me	66.31002308375332
They knew full well that this fugitive must be a bandit but there is an innate sympathy between the Roman brigand and the Roman peasant and the latter is always ready to aid the former	137.61654632479892
Vampa without saying a word hastened to the stone that closed up the entrance to their grotto drew it away made a sign to the fugitive to take refuge there in a retreat unknown to everyone closed the stone upon him and then went and resumed his seat by Teresa	146.48397683294633
Instantly afterwards four carbineers on horseback appeared on the edge of the wood three of them appeared to be looking for the fugitive while the fourth dragged a brigand prisoner by the neck	139.7762018588118
The three carbineers looked about carefully on every side saw the young peasants and galloping up began to question them	278.5662303332903
That is very annoying said the brigadier for the man we are looking for is the chief	78.01573651669513
Cucumetto cried Luigi and Teresa at the same moment	14.19483498862823
Yes replied the brigadier and as his head is valued at a thousand Roman crowns there would have been five hundred for you if you had helped us to catch him	111.88301169644073
The two young persons exchanged looks	5424.026481295328
The brigadier had a moments hope	559.9222247503391
Five hundred Roman crowns are three thousand lire and three thousand lire are a fortune for two poor orphans who are going to be married	97.30632737179688
Yes it is very annoying said Vampa but we have not seen him	30.04830854720568
Then the carbineers scoured the country in different directions but in vain then after a time they disappeared	159.50359967519864
Vampa then removed the stone and Cucumetto came out	274.9505285582074
Through the crevices in the granite he had seen the two young peasants talking with the carbineers and guessed the subject of their parley	175.6402457442501
He had read in the countenances of Luigi and Teresa their steadfast resolution not to surrender him and he drew from his pocket a purse full of gold which he offered to them	90.29169888945123
But Vampa raised his head proudly as to Teresa her eyes sparkled when she thought of all the fine gowns and gay jewellery she could buy with this purse of gold	130.180261294945
Cucumetto was a cunning fiend and had assumed the form of a brigand instead of a serpent and this look from Teresa showed to him that she was a worthy daughter of Eve and he returned to the forest pausing several times on his way under the pretext of saluting his protectors	111.66428619583007
Several days elapsed and they neither saw nor heard of Cucumetto	483.9037759483288
The time of the Carnival was at hand	94.65887287413724
The Count of SanFelice announced a grand masked ball to which all that were distinguished in Rome were invited	321.2455646638803
Teresa had a great desire to see this ball	62.641981828527555
Luigi asked permission of his protector the steward that she and he might be present amongst the servants of the house	88.52994263150444
The ball was given by the Count for the particular pleasure of his daughter Carmela whom he adored	216.02208030449134
Carmela was precisely the age and figure of Teresa and Teresa was as handsome as Carmela	220.24103239146058
On the evening of the ball Teresa was attired in her best her most brilliant ornaments in her hair and gayest glass beadsshe was in the costume of the women of Frascati	244.99378655596186
Luigi wore the very picturesque garb of the Roman peasant at holiday time	373.8152209395921
They both mingled as they had leave to do with the servants and peasants	99.3242494095663
The festa was magnificent not only was the villa brilliantly illuminated but thousands of colored lanterns were suspended from the trees in the garden and very soon the palace overflowed to the terraces and the terraces to the gardenwalks	388.1257886705642
At each crosspath was an orchestra and tables spread with refreshments the guests stopped formed quadrilles and danced in any part of the grounds they pleased	720.4212192604216
Carmela was attired like a woman of Sonnino	297.3980918092656
Her cap was embroidered with pearls the pins in her hair were of gold and diamonds her girdle was of Turkey silk with large embroidered flowers her bodice and skirt were of cashmere her apron of Indian muslin and the buttons of her corset were of jewels	414.61215798112045
Two of her companions were dressed the one as a woman of Nettuno and the other as a woman of La Riccia	98.06307367495208
Four young men of the richest and noblest families of Rome accompanied them with that Italian freedom which has not its parallel in any other country in the world	172.50969424161127
They were attired as peasants of Albano Velletri CivitaCastellana and Sora	2438.7390378706423
We need hardly add that these peasant costumes like those of the young women were brilliant with gold and jewels	152.71262157366832
Carmela wished to form a quadrille but there was one lady wanting	754.6957524426489
Carmela looked all around her but not one of the guests had a costume similar to her own or those of her companions	88.67211034869841
The Count of SanFelice pointed out Teresa who was hanging on Luigis arm in a group of peasants	230.3314269980543
Will you allow me father said Carmela	3201.7245613496825
Certainly replied the count are we not in Carnival time	284.97217077096207
Carmela turned towards the young man who was talking with her and saying a few words to him pointed with her finger to Teresa	45.12778963006173
The young man looked bowed in obedience and then went to Teresa and invited her to dance in a quadrille directed by the counts daughter	135.4534478070947
Teresa felt a flush pass over her face she looked at Luigi who could not refuse his assent	51.15105179979791
Luigi slowly relinquished Teresas arm which he had held beneath his own and Teresa accompanied by her elegant cavalier took her appointed place with much agitation in the aristocratic quadrille	197.7662949871882
Certainly in the eyes of an artist the exact and strict costume of Teresa had a very different character from that of Carmela and her companions and Teresa was frivolous and coquettish and thus the embroidery and muslins the cashmere waistgirdles all dazzled her and the reflection of sapphires and diamonds almost turned her giddy brain	502.14144098465835
Luigi felt a sensation hitherto unknown arising in his mind	298.06744717594137
It was like an acute pain which gnawed at his heart and then thrilled through his whole body	247.49864803998972
He followed with his eye each movement of Teresa and her cavalier when their hands touched he felt as though he should swoon every pulse beat with violence and it seemed as though a bell were ringing in his ears	209.9637830618665
When they spoke although Teresa listened timidly and with downcast eyes to the conversation of her cavalier as Luigi could read in the ardent looks of the goodlooking young man that his language was that of praise it seemed as if the whole world was turning round with him and all the voices of hell were whispering in his ears ideas of murder and assassination	175.91230787868938
Then fearing that his paroxysm might get the better of him he clutched with one hand the branch of a tree against which he was leaning and with the other convulsively grasped the dagger with a carved handle which was in his belt and which unwittingly he drew from the scabbard from time to time	85.42264345889923
He felt that influenced by her ambitions and coquettish disposition Teresa might escape him	1051.3861983282927
The young peasant girl at first timid and scared soon recovered herself	1345.0431382963598
We have said that Teresa was handsome but this is not all Teresa was endowed with all those wild graces which are so much more potent than our affected and studied elegancies	272.0457108421124
She had almost all the honors of the quadrille and if she were envious of the Count of SanFelices daughter we will not undertake to say that Carmela was not jealous of her	128.09733762669674
And with overpowering compliments her handsome cavalier led her back to the place whence he had taken her and where Luigi awaited her	159.7768772267831
Twice or thrice during the dance the young girl had glanced at Luigi and each time she saw that he was pale and that his features were agitated once even the blade of his knife half drawn from its sheath had dazzled her eyes with its sinister glare	135.35618848106208
Thus it was almost tremblingly that she resumed her lovers arm	160.57713394821343
The quadrille had been most perfect and it was evident there was a great demand for a repetition Carmela alone objecting to it but the Count of SanFelice besought his daughter so earnestly that she acceded	195.84126770342195
One of the cavaliers then hastened to invite Teresa without whom it was impossible for the quadrille to be formed but the young girl had disappeared	105.87711198093675
The truth was that Luigi had not felt the strength to support another such trial and half by persuasion and half by force he had removed Teresa toward another part of the garden	225.73749486083022
Teresa had yielded in spite of herself but when she looked at the agitated countenance of the young man she understood by his silence and trembling voice that something strange was passing within him	46.583912122718154
She herself was not exempt from internal emotion and without having done anything wrong yet fully comprehended that Luigi was right in reproaching her	381.0450335936712
Why she did not know but yet she did not the less feel that these reproaches were merited	236.09304632528654
However to Teresas great astonishment Luigi remained mute and not a word escaped his lips the rest of the evening	135.81077517689357
When the chill of the night had driven away the guests from the gardens and the gates of the villa were closed on them for the festa indoors he took Teresa quite away and as he left her at her home he said	151.4952858605905
Teresa what were you thinking of as you danced opposite the young Countess of SanFelice	397.2514636858447
I thought replied the young girl with all the frankness of her nature that I would give half my life for a costume such as she wore	99.5203311832643
And what said your cavalier to you	39.60290157289681
He said it only depended on myself to have it and I had only one word to say	46.64113421601537
Do you desire it as ardently as you say	60.50635638995909
Well then you shall have it	43.327947883417686
The young girl much astonished raised her head to look at him but his face was so gloomy and terrible that her words froze to her lips	47.4950867795434
As Luigi spoke thus he left her	38.826894693871076
Teresa followed him with her eyes into the darkness as long as she could and when he had quite disappeared she went into the house with a sigh	42.84433958075054
That night a memorable event occurred due no doubt to the imprudence of some servant who had neglected to extinguish the lights	222.53964092922055
The Villa of SanFelice took fire in the rooms adjoining the very apartment of the lovely Carmela	167.13738639787766
Awakened in the night by the light of the flames she sprang out of bed wrapped herself in a dressinggown and attempted to escape by the door but the corridor by which she hoped to fly was already a prey to the flames	94.85075699063398
She then returned to her room calling for help as loudly as she could when suddenly her window which was twenty feet from the ground was opened a young peasant jumped into the chamber seized her in his arms and with superhuman skill and strength conveyed her to the turf of the grassplot where she fainted	107.83874494808418
When she recovered her father was by her side	67.36084634276877
All the servants surrounded her offering her assistance	618.3670055095675
An entire wing of the villa was burnt down but what of that as long as Carmela was safe and uninjured	366.01118637178496
Her preserver was everywhere sought for but he did not appear he was inquired after but no one had seen him	49.24884890323391
Carmela was greatly troubled that she had not recognized him	37.85870069401924
As the count was immensely rich excepting the danger Carmela had runand the marvellous manner in which she had escaped made that appear to him rather a favor of Providence than a real misfortunethe loss occasioned by the conflagration was to him but a trifle	315.606518196477
The next day at the usual hour the two young peasants were on the borders of the forest	36.25108542720233
He came toward Teresa in high spirits and seemed to have completely forgotten the events of the previous evening	76.81223592743953
The young girl was very pensive but seeing Luigi so cheerful she on her part assumed a smiling air which was natural to her when she was not excited or in a passion	230.4577260492586
Luigi took her arm beneath his own and led her to the door of the grotto	26.81856879584312
The young girl perceiving that there was something extraordinary looked at him steadfastly	270.09488293653544
Teresa said Luigi yesterday evening you told me you would give all the world to have a costume similar to that of the counts daughter	62.160899224203014
Yes replied Teresa with astonishment but I was mad to utter such a wish	65.75506153661361
And I replied Very well you shall have it	17.48090387401793
Yes replied the young girl whose astonishment increased at every word uttered by Luigi but of course your reply was only to please me	246.04123024903848
I have promised no more than I have given you Teresa said Luigi proudly	107.98382753335481
Go into the grotto and dress yourself	1061.9505164628656
At these words he drew away the stone and showed Teresa the grotto lighted up by two wax lights which burnt on each side of a splendid mirror on a rustic table made by Luigi were spread out the pearl necklace and the diamond pins and on a chair at the side was laid the rest of the costume	168.72571321694903
Teresa uttered a cry of joy and without inquiring whence this attire came or even thanking Luigi darted into the grotto transformed into a dressingroom	320.43652424214787
Luigi pushed the stone behind her for on the crest of a small adjacent hill which cut off the view toward Palestrina he saw a traveller on horseback stopping a moment as if uncertain of his road and thus presenting against the blue sky that perfect outline which is peculiar to distant objects in southern climes	262.86936514919125
When he saw Luigi he put his horse into a gallop and advanced toward him	34.90289020522414
The traveller who was going from Palestrina to Tivoli had mistaken his way the young man directed him but as at a distance of a quarter of a mile the road again divided into three ways and on reaching these the traveller might again stray from his route he begged Luigi to be his guide	187.46334979163998
Luigi threw his cloak on the ground placed his carbine on his shoulder and freed from his heavy covering preceded the traveller with the rapid step of a mountaineer which a horse can scarcely keep up with	105.75379749207082
In ten minutes Luigi and the traveller reached the crossroads	290.47804754346856
On arriving there with an air as majestic as that of an emperor he stretched his hand towards that one of the roads which the traveller was to follow	67.70061147890826
That is your road excellency and now you can not again mistake	93.36476510394944
And here is your recompense said the traveller offering the young herdsman some small pieces of money	191.91671680403255
Thank you said Luigi drawing back his hand I render a service I do not sell it	68.80306831184609
Well replied the traveller who seemed used to this difference between the servility of a man of the cities and the pride of the mountaineer if you refuse wages you will perhaps accept a gift	123.53430166602216
Ah yes that is another thing	44.5909697408838
Then said the traveller take these two Venetian sequins and give them to your bride to make herself a pair of earrings	189.1290118198025
And then do you take this poniard said the young herdsman you will not find one better carved between Albano and CivitaCastellana	292.1616529645154
I accept it answered the traveller but then the obligation will be on my side for this poniard is worth more than two sequins	122.60256588154822
For a dealer perhaps but for me who engraved it myself it is hardly worth a piastre	254.57980045882593
What is your name inquired the traveller	252.92252093305
Luigi Vampa replied the shepherd with the same air as he would have replied Alexander King of Macedon	135.92469963905873
I said the traveller am called Sinbad the Sailor	234.46558752669108
Yes replied the narrator that was the name which the traveller gave to Vampa as his own	147.62791315472398
Well and what may you have to say against this name inquired Albert it is a very pretty name and the adventures of the gentleman of that name amused me very much in my youth I must confess	73.28419820237573
The name of Sinbad the Sailor as may well be supposed awakened in him a world of recollections as had the name of the Count of Monte Cristo on the previous evening	58.55175230079961
Proceed said he to the host	819.1710883497235
Vampa put the two sequins haughtily into his pocket and slowly returned by the way he had gone	57.78018505117488
As he came within two or three hundred paces of the grotto he thought he heard a cry	32.46791054871949
He listened to know whence this sound could proceed	267.91301587354224
A moment afterwards he thought he heard his own name pronounced distinctly	155.71647970470633
The cry proceeded from the grotto	4938.938461149507
He bounded like a chamois cocking his carbine as he went and in a moment reached the summit of a hill opposite to that on which he had perceived the traveller	101.54425345584436
Three cries for help came more distinctly to his ear	84.540292117053
He cast his eyes around him and saw a man carrying off Teresa as Nessus the centaur carried Deianira	892.8204388005018
This man who was hastening towards the wood was already threequarters of the way on the road from the grotto to the forest	84.87274241224124
Vampa measured the distance the man was at least two hundred paces in advance of him and there was not a chance of overtaking him	63.95999744534904
The young shepherd stopped as if his feet had been rooted to the ground then he put the butt of his carbine to his shoulder took aim at the ravisher followed him for a second in his track and then fired	90.12549973060737
The ravisher stopped suddenly his knees bent under him and he fell with Teresa in his arms	48.06133884696486
The young girl rose instantly but the man lay on the earth struggling in the agonies of death	76.47102579546672
Vampa then rushed towards Teresa for at ten paces from the dying man her legs had failed her and she had dropped on her knees so that the young man feared that the ball that had brought down his enemy had also wounded his betrothed	74.21249388075736
Fortunately she was unscathed and it was fright alone that had overcome Teresa	639.6885501065652
When Luigi had assured himself that she was safe and unharmed he turned towards the wounded man	79.13383631215927
He had just expired with clenched hands his mouth in a spasm of agony and his hair on end in the sweat of death	74.58951352881863
His eyes remained open and menacing	2031.123672013042
Vampa approached the corpse and recognized Cucumetto	10716.116055773655
From the day on which the bandit had been saved by the two young peasants he had been enamoured of Teresa and had sworn she should be his	101.6600504401427
From that time he had watched them and profiting by the moment when her lover had left her alone had carried her off and believed he at length had her in his power when the ball directed by the unerring skill of the young herdsman had pierced his heart	139.0551149525367
Vampa gazed on him for a moment without betraying the slightest emotion while on the contrary Teresa shuddering in every limb dared not approach the slain ruffian but by degrees and threw a hesitating glance at the dead body over the shoulder of her lover	179.2689147648806
Suddenly Vampa turned toward his mistress	1499.2100212890807
Ah said hegood good You are dressed it is now my turn to dress myself	106.35204498474704
Teresa was clothed from head to foot in the garb of the Count of SanFelices daughter	34.16789415352876
Vampa took Cucumettos body in his arms and conveyed it to the grotto while in her turn Teresa remained outside	157.39053940454122
If a second traveller had passed he would have seen a strange thinga shepherdess watching her flock clad in a cashmere grown with earrings and necklace of pearls diamond pins and buttons of sapphires emeralds and rubies	456.54419201489617
He would no doubt have believed that he had returned to the times of Florian and would have declared on reaching Paris that he had met an Alpine shepherdess seated at the foot of the Sabine Hill	146.8053659467852
At the end of a quarter of an hour Vampa quitted the grotto his costume was no less elegant than that of Teresa	114.9202679080662
He wore a vest of garnetcolored velvet with buttons of cut gold a silk waistcoat covered with embroidery a Roman scarf tied round his neck a cartridgebox worked with gold and red and green silk skyblue velvet breeches fastened above the knee with diamond buckles garters of deerskin worked with a thousand arabesques and a hat whereon hung ribbons of all colors two watches hung from his girdle and a splendid poniard was in his belt	330.26196113529556
Teresa uttered a cry of admiration	987.5036819964389
Vampa in this attire resembled a painting by Lopold Robert or Schnetz	1731.8446446058877
He had assumed the entire costume of Cucumetto	371.5971733934946
The young man saw the effect produced on his betrothed and a smile of pride passed over his lips	52.06939190337249
Now he said to Teresa are you ready to share my fortune whatever it may be	50.16439605790984
Oh yes exclaimed the young girl enthusiastically	1903.4016750243395
And follow me wherever I go	1099.9628996775987
Then take my arm and let us on we have no time to lose	39.64490798828918
The young girl did so without questioning her lover as to where he was conducting her for he appeared to her at this moment as handsome proud and powerful as a god	134.49487786905416
They went towards the forest and soon entered it	69.4745507035993
We need scarcely say that all the paths of the mountain were known to Vampa he therefore went forward without a moments hesitation although there was no beaten track but he knew his path by looking at the trees and bushes and thus they kept on advancing for nearly an hour and a half	152.9503511106625
At the end of this time they had reached the thickest part of the forest	63.04537704358699
A torrent whose bed was dry led into a deep gorge	1194.1632680432415
Vampa took this wild road which enclosed between two ridges and shadowed by the tufted umbrage of the pines seemed but for the difficulties of its descent that path to Avernus of which Virgil speaks	454.76900301151437
Teresa had become alarmed at the wild and deserted look of the plain around her and pressed closely against her guide not uttering a syllable but as she saw him advance with even step and composed countenance she endeavored to repress her emotion	214.28664291153453
Suddenly about ten paces from them a man advanced from behind a tree and aimed at Vampa	163.50494632716925
Not another step he said or you are a dead man	39.81452746840412
What then said Vampa raising his hand with a gesture of disdain while Teresa no longer able to restrain her alarm clung closely to him do wolves rend each other	224.02816426389413
Who are you inquired the sentinel	2574.4487014832584
I am Luigi Vampa shepherd of the SanFelice farm	1247.0911850267755
I would speak with your companions who are in the glade at Rocca Bianca	668.2090815853775
Follow me then said the sentinel or as you know your way go first	188.14301767423768
Vampa smiled disdainfully at this precaution on the part of the bandit went before Teresa and continued to advance with the same firm and easy step as before	132.3628486493065
At the end of ten minutes the bandit made them a sign to stop	104.90857519155861
Then the bandit thrice imitated the cry of a crow a croak answered this signal	340.80074881159106
Good said the sentry you may now go on	126.33676141221476
Luigi and Teresa again set forward as they went on Teresa clung tremblingly to her lover at the sight of weapons and the glistening of carbines through the trees	203.76766111495775
The retreat of Rocca Bianca was at the top of a small mountain which no doubt in former days had been a volcanoan extinct volcano before the days when Remus and Romulus had deserted Alba to come and found the city of Rome	211.49326179234095
Teresa and Luigi reached the summit and all at once found themselves in the presence of twenty bandits	83.47686366805281
Here is a young man who seeks and wishes to speak to you said the sentinel	81.20420941620404
What has he to say inquired the young man who was in command in the chiefs absence	83.98986086575817
I wish to say that I am tired of a shepherds life was Vampas reply	211.250761058292
Ah I understand said the lieutenant and you seek admittance into our ranks	505.6670643312487
Welcome cried several bandits from Ferrusino Pampinara and Anagni who had recognized Luigi Vampa	1433.0282911757329
Yes but I came to ask something more than to be your companion	88.75217764351594
And what may that be inquired the bandits with astonishment	350.4183116186171
I come to ask to be your captain said the young man	24.21230931343256
And what have you done to aspire to this honor demanded the lieutenant	300.7147227442484
I have killed your chief Cucumetto whose dress I now wear and I set fire to the villa SanFelice to procure a weddingdress for my betrothed	396.2417860839615
An hour afterwards Luigi Vampa was chosen captain vice Cucumetto deceased	10134.536428804378
Well my dear Albert said Franz turning towards his friend what think you of citizen Luigi Vampa	350.5494633654621
I say he is a myth replied Albert and never had an existence	414.8271481479956
And what may a myth be inquired Pastrini	2148.147358673133
The explanation would be too long my dear landlord replied Franz	143.44197257117526
And you say that Signor Vampa exercises his profession at this moment in the environs of Rome	83.95403360540178
And with a boldness of which no bandit before him ever gave an example	688.8476207229402
Then the police have vainly tried to lay hands on him	25.311188495719907
Why you see he has a good understanding with the shepherds in the plains the fishermen of the Tiber and the smugglers of the coast	167.3486403086037
They seek for him in the mountains and he is on the waters they follow him on the waters and he is on the open sea then they pursue him and he has suddenly taken refuge in the islands at Giglio Giannutri or Monte Cristo and when they hunt for him there he reappears suddenly at Albano Tivoli or La Riccia	233.97085852940842
And how does he behave towards travellers	5140.253829505723
Alas his plan is very simple	144.88284430939683
It depends on the distance he may be from the city whether he gives eight hours twelve hours or a day wherein to pay their ransom and when that time has elapsed he allows another hours grace	210.62072624765486
At the sixtieth minute of this hour if the money is not forthcoming he blows out the prisoners brains with a pistolshot or plants his dagger in his heart and that settles the account	307.92934724077185
Well Albert inquired Franz of his companion are you still disposed to go to the Colosseum by the outer wall	91.48794529296121
Quite so said Albert if the way be picturesque	559.011656458923
The clock struck nine as the door opened and a coachman appeared	34.103117499796866
Excellencies said he the coach is ready	26.01722408094727
Well then said Franz let us to the Colosseum	90.0535331030868
By the Porta del Popolo or by the streets your excellencies	283.4260206349816
By the streets morbleu by the streets cried Franz	480.93276883775025
Ah my dear fellow said Albert rising and lighting his third cigar really I thought you had more courage	266.5893935789006
So saying the two young men went down the staircase and got into the carriage	24.309318468138823
Franz had so managed his route that during the ride to the Colosseum they passed not a single ancient ruin so that no preliminary impression interfered to mitigate the colossal proportions of the gigantic building they came to admire	431.73626044645806
The road selected was a continuation of the Via Sistina then by cutting off the right angle of the street in which stands Santa Maria Maggiore and proceeding by the Via Urbana and San Pietro in Vincoli the travellers would find themselves directly opposite the Colosseum	456.3422658334074
This itinerary possessed another great advantagethat of leaving Franz at full liberty to indulge his deep reverie upon the subject of Signor Pastrinis story in which his mysterious host of Monte Cristo was so strangely mixed up	296.0423469227384
Seated with folded arms in a corner of the carriage he continued to ponder over the singular history he had so lately listened to and to ask himself an interminable number of questions touching its various circumstances without however arriving at a satisfactory reply to any of them	207.3690325178148
One fact more than the rest brought his friend Sinbad the Sailor back to his recollection and that was the mysterious sort of intimacy that seemed to exist between the brigands and the sailors and Pastrinis account of Vampas having found refuge on board the vessels of smugglers and fishermen reminded Franz of the two Corsican bandits he had found supping so amicably with the crew of the little yacht which had even deviated from its course and touched at PortoVecchio for the sole purpose of landing them	251.08584914574365
The very name assumed by his host of Monte Cristo and again repeated by the landlord of the Htel de Londres abundantly proved to him that his island friend was playing his philanthropic part on the shores of Piombino Civita Vecchia Ostia and Gata as on those of Corsica Tuscany and Spain and further Franz bethought him of having heard his singular entertainer speak both of Tunis and Palermo proving thereby how largely his circle of acquaintances extended	388.42202656111283
But however the mind of the young man might be absorbed in these reflections they were at once dispersed at the sight of the dark frowning ruins of the stupendous Colosseum through the various openings of which the pale moonlight played and flickered like the unearthly gleam from the eyes of the wandering dead	172.52449475449623
The carriage stopped near the Meta Sudans the door was opened and the young men eagerly alighting found themselves opposite a cicerone who appeared to have sprung up from the ground so unexpected was his appearance	133.9360680699755
The usual guide from the hotel having followed them they had paid two conductors nor is it possible at Rome to avoid this abundant supply of guides besides the ordinary cicerone who seizes upon you directly you set foot in your hotel and never quits you while you remain in the city there is also a special cicerone belonging to each monumentnay almost to each part of a monument	293.3986849025433
It may therefore be easily imagined there is no scarcity of guides at the Colosseum that wonder of all ages which Martial thus eulogizes	678.6793937921359
Let Memphis cease to boast the barbarous miracles of her pyramids and the wonders of Babylon be talked of no more among us all must bow to the superiority of the gigantic labor of the Csars and the many voices of Fame spread far and wide the surpassing merits of this incomparable monument	343.0683447392062
As for Albert and Franz they essayed not to escape from their ciceronian tyrants and indeed it would have been so much the more difficult to break their bondage as the guides alone are permitted to visit these monuments with torches in their hands	219.8201778740134
Thus then the young men made no attempt at resistance but blindly and confidingly surrendered themselves into the care and custody of their conductors	636.4753996593413
Franz had already made seven or eight similar excursions to the Colosseum while his less favored companion trod for the first time in his life the classic ground forming the monument of Flavius Vespasian and to his credit be it spoken his mind even amid the glib loquacity of the guides was duly and deeply touched with awe and enthusiastic admiration of all he saw and certainly no adequate notion of these stupendous ruins can be formed save by such as have visited them and more especially by moonlight at which time the vast proportions of the building appear twice as large when viewed by the mysterious beams of a southern moonlit sky whose rays are sufficiently clear and vivid to light the horizon with a glow equal to the soft twilight of a western clime	381.025024668399
Scarcely therefore had the reflective Franz walked a hundred steps beneath the interior porticoes of the ruin when abandoning Albert to the guides who would by no means yield their prescriptive right of carrying their victims through the routine regularly laid down and as regularly followed by them but dragged the unconscious visitor to the various objects with a pertinacity that admitted of no appeal beginning as a matter of course with the Lions Den the Hall of the Gladiators and finishing with Csars Podium to escape a jargon and mechanical survey of the wonders by which he was surrounded Franz ascended a halfdilapidated staircase and leaving them to follow their monotonous round seated himself at the foot of a column and immediately opposite a large aperture which permitted him to enjoy a full and undisturbed view of the gigantic dimensions of the majestic ruin	367.5125353468289
Franz had remained for nearly a quarter of an hour perfectly hidden by the shadow of the vast column at whose base he had found a restingplace and from whence his eyes followed the motions of Albert and his guides who holding torches in their hands had emerged from a vomitorium at the opposite extremity of the Colosseum and then again disappeared down the steps conducting to the seats reserved for the Vestal virgins resembling as they glided along some restless shades following the flickering glare of so many ignes fatui	212.27362380430688
All at once his ear caught a sound resembling that of a stone rolling down the staircase opposite the one by which he had himself ascended	89.27982117523294
There was nothing remarkable in the circumstance of a fragment of granite giving way and falling heavily below but it seemed to him that the substance that fell gave way beneath the pressure of a foot and also that someone who endeavored as much as possible to prevent his footsteps from being heard was approaching the spot where he sat	105.08323740705846
Conjecture soon became certainty for the figure of a man was distinctly visible to Franz gradually emerging from the staircase opposite upon which the moon was at that moment pouring a full tide of silvery brightness	178.05052797342708
The stranger thus presenting himself was probably a person who like Franz preferred the enjoyment of solitude and his own thoughts to the frivolous gabble of the guides	194.8445135348283
And his appearance had nothing extraordinary in it but the hesitation with which he proceeded stopping and listening with anxious attention at every step he took convinced Franz that he expected the arrival of some person	171.2524952722064
By a sort of instinctive impulse Franz withdrew as much as possible behind his pillar	365.8685449098778
About ten feet from the spot where he and the stranger were the roof had given way leaving a large round opening through which might be seen the blue vault of heaven thickly studded with stars	144.56498446139707
Around this opening which had possibly for ages permitted a free entrance to the brilliant moonbeams that now illumined the vast pile grew a quantity of creeping plants whose delicate green branches stood out in bold relief against the clear azure of the firmament while large masses of thick strong fibrous shoots forced their way through the chasm and hung floating to and fro like so many waving strings	750.3029333453371
The person whose mysterious arrival had attracted the attention of Franz stood in a kind of halflight that rendered it impossible to distinguish his features although his dress was easily made out	154.20089231312636
He wore a large brown mantle one fold of which thrown over his left shoulder served likewise to mask the lower part of his countenance while the upper part was completely hidden by his broadbrimmed hat	249.3112995832398
The lower part of his dress was more distinctly visible by the bright rays of the moon which entering through the broken ceiling shed their refulgent beams on feet cased in elegantly made boots of polished leather over which descended fashionably cut trousers of black cloth	472.94519575482457
From the imperfect means Franz had of judging he could only come to one conclusionthat the person whom he was thus watching certainly belonged to no inferior station of life	312.9544867592338
Some few minutes had elapsed and the stranger began to show manifest signs of impatience when a slight noise was heard outside the aperture in the roof and almost immediately a dark shadow seemed to obstruct the flood of light that had entered it and the figure of a man was clearly seen gazing with eager scrutiny on the immense space beneath him then as his eye caught sight of him in the mantle he grasped a floating mass of thickly matted boughs and glided down by their help to within three or four feet of the ground and then leaped lightly on his feet	112.68309065260827
The man who had performed this daring act with so much indifference wore the Transtevere costume	371.8357259845901
I beg your excellencys pardon for keeping you waiting said the man in the Roman dialect but I do nt think I m many minutes after my time ten oclock has just struck by the clock of Saint John Lateran	123.862503776734
Say not a word about being late replied the stranger in purest Tuscan tis I who am too soon	413.67879238081963
But even if you had caused me to wait a little while I should have felt quite sure that the delay was not occasioned by any fault of yours	73.5471729773255
Your excellency is perfectly right in so thinking said the man I came here direct from the Castle of St	108.78696860550784
Angelo and I had an immense deal of trouble before I could get a chance to speak to Beppo	185.65725356445606
Oh Beppo is employed in the prison and I give him so much a year to let me know what is going on within his holinesss castle	97.0387250958469
Indeed You are a provident person I see	93.31568910891481
Why you see no one knows what may happen	43.372873902534096
Perhaps some of these days I may be entrapped like poor Peppino and may be very glad to have some little nibbling mouse to gnaw the meshes of my net and so help me out of prison	257.3626589358256
That two executions of considerable interest will take place the day after tomorrow at two oclock as is customary at Rome at the commencement of all great festivals	110.681547107579
One of the culprits will be mazzolato3 he is an atrocious villain who murdered the priest who brought him up and deserves not the smallest pity	218.51709091041573
The other sufferer is sentenced to be decapitato4 and he your excellency is poor Peppino	347.4267316757476
The fact is that you have inspired not only the pontifical government but also the neighboring states with such extreme fear that they are glad of all opportunity of making an example	283.1500269697816
But Peppino did not even belong to my band he was merely a poor shepherd whose only crime consisted in furnishing us with provisions	463.8381229743254
Which makes him your accomplice to all intents and purposes	1583.3074807639164
But mark the distinction with which he is treated instead of being knocked on the head as you would be if once they caught hold of you he is simply sentenced to be guillotined by which means too the amusements of the day are diversified and there is a spectacle to please every spectator	220.59926677763522
Without reckoning the wholly unexpected one I am preparing to surprise them with	107.73103538332936
My good friend said the man in the cloak excuse me for saying that you seem to me precisely in the mood to commit some wild or extravagant act	205.72426145433397
Perhaps I am but one thing I have resolved on and that is to stop at nothing to restore a poor devil to liberty who has got into this scrape solely from having served me	207.23910108676534
I should hate and despise myself as a coward did I desert the brave fellow in his present extremity	179.1593061092592
And what do you mean to do	7.547463185931019
To surround the scaffold with twenty of my best men who at a signal from me will rush forward directly Peppino is brought for execution and by the assistance of their stilettos drive back the guard and carry off the prisoner	263.8046077570239
That seems to me as hazardous as uncertain and convinces me that my scheme is far better than yours	225.43155683257865
And what is your excellencys project	2497.8006747200716
I will so advantageously bestow 2000 piastres that the person receiving them shall obtain a respite till next year for Peppino and during that year another skilfully placed 1000 piastres will afford him the means of escaping from his prison	420.47958183720584
And do you feel sure of succeeding	1896.653539576717
Pardieu exclaimed the man in the cloak suddenly expressing himself in French	163.72058988195212
What did your excellency say inquired the other	115.1002074131767
I said my good fellow that I would do more singlehanded by the means of gold than you and all your troop could effect with stilettos pistols carbines and blunderbusses included	417.6272270454654
Leave me then to act and have no fears for the result	123.76457933653339
At least there can be no harm in myself and party being in readiness in case your excellency should fail	205.24154073978386
Take what precautions you please if it is any satisfaction to you to do so but rely upon my obtaining the reprieve I seek	113.74520659528542
Remember the execution is fixed for the day after tomorrow and that you have but one day to work in	44.206157443539844
And what of that Is not a day divided into twentyfour hours each hour into sixty minutes and every minute subdivided into sixty seconds Now in 86400 seconds very many things can be done	607.4606848404034
And how shall I know whether your excellency has succeeded or not	78.08084215286142
Oh that is very easily arranged	373.7055220017018
I have engaged the three lower windows at the Caf Rospoli should I have obtained the requisite pardon for Peppino the two outside windows will be hung with yellow damasks and the centre with white having a large cross in red marked on it	220.5761153097279
And whom will you employ to carry the reprieve to the officer directing the execution	222.44626279053932
Send one of your men disguised as a penitent friar and I will give it to him	75.48854309582218
His dress will procure him the means of approaching the scaffold itself and he will deliver the official order to the officer who in his turn will hand it to the executioner in the meantime it will be as well to acquaint Peppino with what we have determined on if it be only to prevent his dying of fear or losing his senses because in either case a very useless expense will have been incurred	153.781138440449
Your excellency said the man you are fully persuaded of my entire devotion to you are you not	96.14044611150052
Nay I flatter myself that there can be no doubt of it replied the cavalier in the cloak	49.67363205355159
Well then only fulfil your promise of rescuing Peppino and henceforward you shall receive not only devotion but the most absolute obedience from myself and those under me that one human being can render to another	358.4205103144337
Have a care how far you pledge yourself my good friend for I may remind you of your promise at some perhaps not very distant period when I in my turn may require your aid and influence	145.70322962734562
Let that day come sooner or later your excellency will find me what I have found you in this my heavy trouble and if from the other end of the world you but write me word to do such or such a thing you may regard it as done for done it shall be on the word and faith of	79.11708503183688
Hush interrupted the stranger I hear a noise	151.56198197643548
Tis some travellers who are visiting the Colosseum by torchlight	1621.3218111629296
Twere better we should not be seen together those guides are nothing but spies and might possibly recognize you and however I may be honored by your friendship my worthy friend if once the extent of our intimacy were known I am sadly afraid both my reputation and credit would suffer thereby	278.45677277978604
Well then if you obtain the reprieve	677.0262794641801
The middle window at the Caf Rospoli will be hung with white damask bearing a red cross	115.29761264736338
Then all three windows will have yellow draperies	2069.7091862650936
And then my good fellow use your daggers in any way you please and I further promise you to be there as a spectator of your prowess	156.58995531688194
We understand each other perfectly then	254.63937477372372
Adieu your excellency depend upon me as firmly as I do upon you	28.483515680996355
Saying these words the Transteverin disappeared down the staircase while his companion muffling his features more closely than before in the folds of his mantle passed almost close to Franz and descended to the arena by an outward flight of steps	150.65794227514039
The next minute Franz heard himself called by Albert who made the lofty building reecho with the sound of his friends name	170.52995220493864
Franz however did not obey the summons till he had satisfied himself that the two men whose conversation he had overheard were at a sufficient distance to prevent his encountering them in his descent	132.94340712430488
In ten minutes after the strangers had departed Franz was on the road to the Piazza di Spagna listening with studied indifference to the learned dissertation delivered by Albert after the manner of Pliny and Calpurnius touching the ironpointed nets used to prevent the ferocious beasts from springing on the spectators	323.3123278001898
Franz let him proceed without interruption and in fact did not hear what was said he longed to be alone and free to ponder over all that had occurred	125.2023756094245
One of the two men whose mysterious meeting in the Colosseum he had so unintentionally witnessed was an entire stranger to him but not so the other and though Franz had been unable to distinguish his features from his being either wrapped in his mantle or obscured by the shadow the tones of his voice had made too powerful an impression on him the first time he had heard them for him ever again to forget them hear them when or where he might	122.13666191596762
It was more especially when this man was speaking in a manner half jesting half bitter that Franzs ear recalled most vividly the deep sonorous yet wellpitched voice that had addressed him in the grotto of Monte Cristo and which he heard for the second time amid the darkness and ruined grandeur of the Colosseum	168.5499909705911
And the more he thought the more entire was his conviction that the person who wore the mantle was no other than his former host and entertainer Sinbad the Sailor	169.87048390536955
Under any other circumstances Franz would have found it impossible to resist his extreme curiosity to know more of so singular a personage and with that intent have sought to renew their short acquaintance but in the present instance the confidential nature of the conversation he had overheard made him with propriety judge that his appearance at such a time would be anything but agreeable	164.5655698876164
As we have seen therefore he permitted his former host to retire without attempting a recognition but fully promising himself a rich indemnity for his present forbearance should chance afford him another opportunity	577.0268115796769
In vain did Franz endeavor to forget the many perplexing thoughts which assailed him in vain did he court the refreshment of sleep	198.22164859741565
Slumber refused to visit his eyelids and the night was passed in feverish contemplation of the chain of circumstances tending to prove the identity of the mysterious visitant to the Colosseum with the inhabitant of the grotto of Monte Cristo and the more he thought the firmer grew his opinion on the subject	117.63464092679766
Worn out at length he fell asleep at daybreak and did not awake till late	131.2551851856783
Like a genuine Frenchman Albert had employed his time in arranging for the evenings diversion he had sent to engage a box at the Teatro Argentina and Franz having a number of letters to write relinquished the carriage to Albert for the whole of the day	139.44550196674618
At five oclock Albert returned delighted with his days work he had been occupied in leaving his letters of introduction and had received in return more invitations to balls and routs than it would be possible for him to accept besides this he had seen as he called it all the remarkable sights at Rome	177.69892359929682
Yes in a single day he had accomplished what his more seriousminded companion would have taken weeks to effect	385.44477425985406
Neither had he neglected to ascertain the name of the piece to be played that night at the Teatro Argentina and also what performers appeared in it	183.68293628125178
The opera of Parisina was announced for representation and the principal actors were Coselli Moriani and La Specchia	899.118573568393
The young men therefore had reason to consider themselves fortunate in having the opportunity of hearing one of the best works by the composer of Lucia di Lammermoor supported by three of the most renowned vocalists of Italy	220.92443544212867
Albert had never been able to endure the Italian theatres with their orchestras from which it is impossible to see and the absence of balconies or open boxes all these defects pressed hard on a man who had had his stall at the Bouffes and had shared a lower box at the Opera	198.33262161531027
Still in spite of this Albert displayed his most dazzling and effective costumes each time he visited the theatres but alas his elegant toilet was wholly thrown away and one of the most worthy representatives of Parisian fashion had to carry with him the mortifying reflection that he had nearly overrun Italy without meeting with a single adventure	347.37013580218706
Sometimes Albert would affect to make a joke of his want of success but internally he was deeply wounded and his selflove immensely piqued to think that Albert de Morcerf the most admired and most sought after of any young person of his day should thus be passed over and merely have his labor for his pains	281.57289621773987
And the thing was so much the more annoying as according to the characteristic modesty of a Frenchman Albert had quitted Paris with the full conviction that he had only to show himself in Italy to carry all before him and that upon his return he should astonish the Parisian world with the recital of his numerous loveaffairs	140.69333518302517
Alas poor Albert None of those interesting adventures fell in his way the lovely Genoese Florentines and Neapolitans were all faithful if not to their husbands at least to their lovers and thought not of changing even for the splendid appearance of Albert de Morcerf and all he gained was the painful conviction that the ladies of Italy have this advantage over those of France that they are faithful even in their infidelity	236.44166270281977
Yet he could not restrain a hope that in Italy as elsewhere there might be an exception to the general rule	179.11813252646203
Albert besides being an elegant welllooking young man was also possessed of considerable talent and ability moreover he was a viscounta recently created one certainly but in the present day it is not necessary to go as far back as Noah in tracing a descent and a genealogical tree is equally estimated whether dated from 1399 or merely 1815 but to crown all these advantages Albert de Morcerf commanded an income of 50000 livres a more than sufficient sum to render him a personage of considerable importance in Paris	347.42074083156376
It was therefore no small mortification to him to have visited most of the principal cities in Italy without having excited the most trifling observation	205.59437495057958
Albert however hoped to indemnify himself for all these slights and indifferences during the Carnival knowing full well that among the different states and kingdoms in which this festivity is celebrated Rome is the spot where even the wisest and gravest throw off the usual rigidity of their lives and deign to mingle in the follies of this time of liberty and relaxation	327.7432627976841
The Carnival was to commence on the morrow therefore Albert had not an instant to lose in setting forth the programme of his hopes expectations and claims to notice	262.7490586449767
With this design he had engaged a box in the most conspicuous part of the theatre and exerted himself to set off his personal attractions by the aid of the most rich and elaborate toilet	124.09732415264432
The box taken by Albert was in the first circle although each of the three tiers of boxes is deemed equally aristocratic and is for this reason generally styled the nobilitys boxes and although the box engaged for the two friends was sufficiently capacious to contain at least a dozen persons it had cost less than would be paid at some of the French theatres for one admitting merely four occupants	318.62116172213535
Another motive had influenced Alberts selection of his seatwho knew but that thus advantageously placed he might not in truth attract the notice of some fair Roman and an introduction might ensue that would procure him the offer of a seat in a carriage or a place in a princely balcony from which he might behold the gayeties of the Carnival	259.7051744711366
These united considerations made Albert more lively and anxious to please than he had hitherto been	130.225597129232
Totally disregarding the business of the stage he leaned from his box and began attentively scrutinizing the beauty of each pretty woman aided by a powerful operaglass but alas this attempt to attract notice wholly failed not even curiosity had been excited and it was but too apparent that the lovely creatures into whose good graces he was desirous of stealing were all so much engrossed with themselves their lovers or their own thoughts that they had not so much as noticed him or the manipulation of his glass	211.88295411722706
The truth was that the anticipated pleasures of the Carnival with the Holy Week that was to succeed it so filled every fair breast as to prevent the least attention being bestowed even on the business of the stage	227.2514567200824
The actors made their entries and exits unobserved or unthought of at certain conventional moments the spectators would suddenly cease their conversation or rouse themselves from their musings to listen to some brilliant effort of Morianis a wellexecuted recitative by Coselli or to join in loud applause at the wonderful powers of La Specchia but that momentary excitement over they quickly relapsed into their former state of preoccupation or interesting conversation	773.8252637057832
Towards the close of the first act the door of a box which had been hitherto vacant was opened a lady entered to whom Franz had been introduced in Paris where indeed he had imagined she still was	104.56119666264122
The quick eye of Albert caught the involuntary start with which his friend beheld the new arrival and turning to him he said hastily	154.99813147470408
Do you know the woman who has just entered that box	119.52694158936549
Yes what do you think of her	39.544036305337194
Oh she is perfectly lovelywhat a complexion And such magnificent hair Is she French	718.4514114127109
Ah I know her by name exclaimed Albert she is said to possess as much wit and cleverness as beauty	150.4596601740433
I was to have been presented to her when I met her at Madame Villeforts ball	172.01726741431415
Shall I assist you in repairing your negligence asked Franz	957.5783899004251
My dear fellow are you really on such good terms with her as to venture to take me to her box	119.35304500956539
Why I have only had the honor of being in her society and conversing with her three or four times in my life but you know that even such an acquaintance as that might warrant my doing what you ask	74.30453780386236
At that instant the countess perceived Franz and graciously waved her hand to him to which he replied by a respectful inclination of the head	139.2672494511329
Upon my word said Albert you seem to be on excellent terms with the beautiful countess	69.44100103607123
You are mistaken in thinking so returned Franz calmly but you merely fall into the same error which leads so many of our countrymen to commit the most egregious blundersI mean that of judging the habits and customs of Italy and Spain by our Parisian notions believe me nothing is more fallacious than to form any estimate of the degree of intimacy you may suppose existing among persons by the familiar terms they seem upon there is a similarity of feeling at this instant between ourselves and the countessnothing more	313.204901397898
Is there indeed my good fellow Pray tell me is it sympathy of heart	135.63147314543994
No of taste continued Franz gravely	6613.733571539152
And in what manner has this congeniality of mind been evinced	2246.9699225493187
By the countesss visiting the Colosseum as we did last night by moonlight and nearly alone	357.59785791431085
And what did you say to her	25.10758327024942
Oh we talked of the illustrious dead of whom that magnificent ruin is a glorious monument	504.54294986948355
Upon my word cried Albert you must have been a very entertaining companion alone or all but alone with a beautiful woman in such a place of sentiment as the Colosseum and yet to find nothing better to talk about than the dead All I can say is if ever I should get such a chance the living should be my theme	125.46577995800585
And you will probably find your theme illchosen	8412.12513265606
But said Albert breaking in upon his discourse never mind the past let us only remember the present	499.94694896440365
Are you not going to keep your promise of introducing me to the fair subject of our remarks	105.14337930876644
Certainly directly the curtain falls on the stage	13.344569382213361
What a confounded long time this first act lasts	1438.7638248208953
I believe on my soul that they never mean to finish it	141.8574881393961
Oh yes they will only listen to that charming finale	861.4590401833194
How exquisitely Coselli sings his part	2041.0382694231375
But what an awkward inelegant fellow he is	106.27240024505322
Well then what do you say to La Specchia Did you ever see anything more perfect than her acting	147.31200697555283
Why you know my dear fellow when one has been accustomed to Malibran and Sontag such singers as these do nt make the same impression on you they perhaps do on others	243.8300802950192
At least you must admire Morianis style and execution	7050.506134143996
I never fancied men of his dark ponderous appearance singing with a voice like a womans	236.711822901142
My good friend said Franz turning to him while Albert continued to point his glass at every box in the theatre you seem determined not to approve you are really too difficult to please	136.6496358461874
The curtain at length fell on the performances to the infinite satisfaction of the Viscount of Morcerf who seized his hat rapidly passed his fingers through his hair arranged his cravat and wristbands and signified to Franz that he was waiting for him to lead the way	66.23561067874344
Franz who had mutely interrogated the countess and received from her a gracious smile in token that he would be welcome sought not to retard the gratification of Alberts eager impatience but began at once the tour of the house closely followed by Albert who availed himself of the few minutes required to reach the opposite side of the theatre to settle the height and smoothness of his collar and to arrange the lappets of his coat	133.4735693820895
This important task was just completed as they arrived at the countesss box	291.0931266544106
At the knock the door was immediately opened and the young man who was seated beside the countess in obedience to the Italian custom instantly rose and surrendered his place to the strangers who in turn would be expected to retire upon the arrival of other visitors	112.46342739847194
Franz presented Albert as one of the most distinguished young men of the day both as regarded his position in society and extraordinary talents nor did he say more than the truth for in Paris and the circle in which the viscount moved he was looked upon and cited as a model of perfection	124.72118937800795
Franz added that his companion deeply grieved at having been prevented the honor of being presented to the countess during her sojourn in Paris was most anxious to make up for it and had requested him Franz to remedy the past misfortune by conducting him to her box and concluded by asking pardon for his presumption in having taken it upon himself to do so	145.61347245532295
The countess in reply bowed gracefully to Albert and extended her hand with cordial kindness to Franz then inviting Albert to take the vacant seat beside her she recommended Franz to take the next best if he wished to view the ballet and pointed to the one behind her own chair	207.32122522212435
Albert was soon deeply engrossed in discoursing upon Paris and Parisian matters speaking to the countess of the various persons they both knew there	326.76796436474825
Franz perceived how completely he was in his element and unwilling to interfere with the pleasure he so evidently felt took up Alberts glass and began in his turn to survey the audience	153.08122060173247
Sitting alone in the front of a box immediately opposite but situated on the third row was a woman of exquisite beauty dressed in a Greek costume which evidently from the ease and grace with which she wore it was her national attire	182.81355075450546
Behind her but in deep shadow was the outline of a masculine figure but the features of this latter personage it was not possible to distinguish	106.02569964492714
Franz could not forbear breaking in upon the apparently interesting conversation passing between the countess and Albert to inquire of the former if she knew who was the fair Albanian opposite since beauty such as hers was well worthy of being observed by either sex	352.501030773673
All I can tell about her replied the countess is that she has been at Rome since the beginning of the season for I saw her where she now sits the very first night of the season and since then she has never missed a performance	129.99857287147128
Sometimes she is accompanied by the person who is now with her and at others she is merely attended by a black servant	121.75073431858782
And what do you think of her personal appearance	223.97655973514415
Oh I consider her perfectly lovelyshe is just my idea of what Medora must have been	387.38678126489947
Franz and the countess exchanged a smile and then the latter resumed her conversation with Albert while Franz returned to his previous survey of the house and company	175.76558384904052
The curtain rose on the ballet which was one of those excellent specimens of the Italian school admirably arranged and put on the stage by Henri who has established for himself a great reputation throughout Italy for his taste and skill in the choreographic artone of those masterly productions of grace method and elegance in which the whole corps de ballet from the principal dancers to the humblest supernumerary are all engaged on the stage at the same time and a hundred and fifty persons may be seen exhibiting the same attitude or elevating the same arm or leg with a simultaneous movement that would lead you to suppose that but one mind one act of volition influenced the moving mass	264.990720543759
However much the ballet might have claimed his attention Franz was too deeply occupied with the beautiful Greek to take any note of it while she seemed to experience an almost childlike delight in watching it her eager animated looks contrasting strongly with the utter indifference of her companion who during the whole time the piece lasted never even moved not even when the furious crashing din produced by the trumpets cymbals and Chinese bells sounded their loudest from the orchestra	339.0373413592483
Of this he took no heed but was as far as appearances might be trusted enjoying soft repose and bright celestial dreams	1199.538627206034
The ballet at length came to a close and the curtain fell amid the loud unanimous plaudits of an enthusiastic and delighted audience	276.0784654505482
Owing to the very judicious plan of dividing the two acts of the opera with a ballet the pauses between the performances are very short the singers in the opera having time to repose themselves and change their costume when necessary while the dancers are executing their pirouettes and exhibiting their graceful steps	486.8651134423634
The overture to the second act began and at the first sound of the leaders bow across his violin Franz observed the sleeper slowly arise and approach the Greek girl who turned around to say a few words to him and then leaning forward again on the railing of her box she became as absorbed as before in what was going on	121.23886301760717
The countenance of the person who had addressed her remained so completely in the shade that though Franz tried his utmost he could not distinguish a single feature	141.367207189579
The curtain rose and the attention of Franz was attracted by the actors and his eyes turned from the box containing the Greek girl and her strange companion to watch the business of the stage	64.27278476034091
Most of my readers are aware that the second act of Parisina opens with the celebrated and effective duet in which Parisina while sleeping betrays to Azzo the secret of her love for Ugo	550.3539529261029
The injured husband goes through all the emotions of jealousy until conviction seizes on his mind and then in a frenzy of rage and indignation he awakens his guilty wife to tell her that he knows her guilt and to threaten her with his vengeance	218.61306430068998
This duet is one of the most beautiful expressive and terrible conceptions that has ever emanated from the fruitful pen of Donizetti	355.6856176829039
Franz now listened to it for the third time yet its notes so tenderly expressive and fearfully grand as the wretched husband and wife give vent to their different griefs and passions thrilled through the soul of Franz with an effect equal to his first emotions upon hearing it	305.9668344717905
Excited beyond his usual calm demeanor Franz rose with the audience and was about to join the loud enthusiastic applause that followed but suddenly his purpose was arrested his hands fell by his sides and the halfuttered bravos expired on his lips	265.15775209074127
The occupant of the box in which the Greek girl sat appeared to share the universal admiration that prevailed for he left his seat to stand up in front so that his countenance being fully revealed Franz had no difficulty in recognizing him as the mysterious inhabitant of Monte Cristo and the very same person he had encountered the preceding evening in the ruins of the Colosseum and whose voice and figure had seemed so familiar to him	126.9559428697403
All doubt of his identity was now at an end his singular host evidently resided at Rome	343.9308196814245
The surprise and agitation occasioned by this full confirmation of Franzs former suspicion had no doubt imparted a corresponding expression to his features for the countess after gazing with a puzzled look at his face burst into a fit of laughter and begged to know what had happened	169.64050465042322
Countess returned Franz totally unheeding her raillery I asked you a short time since if you knew any particulars respecting the Albanian lady opposite I must now beseech you to inform me who and what is her husband	125.37585440972086
Nay answered the countess I know no more of him than yourself	48.73664529234679
Perhaps you never before noticed him	12.574315300749156
What a questionso truly French Do you not know that we Italians have eyes only for the man we love	145.48778643085245
All I can say is continued the countess taking up the lorgnette and directing it toward the box in question that the gentleman whose history I am unable to furnish seems to me as though he had just been dug up he looks more like a corpse permitted by some friendly gravedigger to quit his tomb for a while and revisit this earth of ours than anything human	195.17727589967325
Oh he is always as colorless as you now see him said Franz	244.8369624825921
Then you know him almost screamed the countess	692.9088645837927
Oh pray do for heavens sake tell us all aboutis he a vampire or a resuscitated corpse or what	336.6143018323665
I fancy I have seen him before and I even think he recognizes me	108.65562097930848
And I can well understand said the countess shrugging up her beautiful shoulders as though an involuntary shudder passed through her veins that those who have once seen that man will never be likely to forget him	72.32266187525786
The sensation experienced by Franz was evidently not peculiar to himself another and wholly uninterested person felt the same unaccountable awe and misgiving	686.233316239194
inquired Franz after the countess had a second time directed her lorgnette at the box what do you think of our opposite neighbor	157.5216456919835
Why that he is no other than Lord Ruthven himself in a living form	84.7146892604137
This fresh allusion to Byron5 drew a smile to Franzs countenance although he could but allow that if anything was likely to induce belief in the existence of vampires it would be the presence of such a man as the mysterious personage before him	153.24782444996393
I must positively find out who and what he is said Franz rising from his seat	52.505526847942676
No no cried the countess you must not leave me	15.856158826828384
I depend upon you to escort me home	400.43157486198567
Oh indeed I can not permit you to go	37.590446391037844
Is it possible whispered Franz that you entertain any fear	255.8417642500974
Ill tell you answered the countess	109.81836168226835
Byron had the most perfect belief in the existence of vampires and even assured me that he had seen them	102.16240000049007
The description he gave me perfectly corresponds with the features and character of the man before us	244.1804289737686
Oh he is the exact personification of what I have been led to expect The coalblack hair large bright glittering eyes in which a wild unearthly fire seems burningthe same ghastly paleness	738.3257624685081
Then observe too that the woman with him is altogether unlike all others of her sex	386.5221729014063
Nobody knows who she is or where she comes from	259.5142259007526
No doubt she belongs to the same horrible race he does and is like himself a dealer in magical arts	409.7763330375907
I entreat of you not to go near himat least tonight and if tomorrow your curiosity still continues as great pursue your researches if you will but tonight you neither can nor shall	541.0782585067719
For that purpose I mean to keep you all to myself	61.166932881118086
Franz protested he could not defer his pursuit till the following day for many reasons	309.69457556351273
Listen to me said the countess and do not be so very headstrong	92.2389377996781
I have a party at my house tonight and therefore can not possibly remain till the end of the opera	72.06609682049623
Now I can not for one instant believe you so devoid of gallantry as to refuse a lady your escort when she even condescends to ask you for it	280.3248181818839
There was nothing else left for Franz to do but to take up his hat open the door of the box and offer the countess his arm	71.69262563289551
It was quite evident by her manner that her uneasiness was not feigned and Franz himself could not resist a feeling of superstitious dreadso much the stronger in him as it arose from a variety of corroborative recollections while the terror of the countess sprang from an instinctive belief originally created in her mind by the wild tales she had listened to till she believed them truths	252.01512928927454
Franz could even feel her arm tremble as he assisted her into the carriage	95.76926185338581
Upon arriving at her hotel Franz perceived that she had deceived him when she spoke of expecting company on the contrary her own return before the appointed hour seemed greatly to astonish the servants	156.64975006602336
Excuse my little subterfuge said the countess in reply to her companions halfreproachful observation on the subject but that horrid man had made me feel quite uncomfortable and I longed to be alone that I might compose my startled mind	222.26092704096578
Nay said she do not smile it ill accords with the expression of your countenance and I am sure it does not spring from your heart	94.00740465627513
I will do anything you desire except relinquish my determination of finding out who this man is	404.0173691597113
I have more reasons than you can imagine for desiring to know who he is from whence he came and whither he is going	99.41500306065743
Where he comes from I am ignorant but I can readily tell you where he is going to and that is down below without the least doubt	60.23598712702935
Let us only speak of the promise you wished me to make said Franz	73.46216168831874
Well then you must give me your word to return immediately to your hotel and make no attempt to follow this man tonight	71.2500854979798
There are certain affinities between the persons we quit and those we meet afterwards	317.19003479034905
For heavens sake do not serve as a conductor between that man and me	312.58663302446337
Pursue your chase after him tomorrow as eagerly as you please but never bring him near me if you would not see me die of terror	64.17088967636485
And now goodnight go to your rooms and try to sleep away all recollections of this evening	96.98229498018725
For my own part I am quite sure I shall not be able to close my eyes	19.696736453000423
So saying the countess quitted Franz leaving him unable to decide whether she were merely amusing herself at his expense or whether her fears and agitations were genuine	398.35871928695343
Upon his return to the hotel Franz found Albert in his dressinggown and slippers listlessly extended on a sofa smoking a cigar	568.4644315074308
My dear fellow cried he springing up is it really you Why I did not expect to see you before tomorrow	92.26058536434432
My dear Albert replied Franz I am glad of this opportunity to tell you once and forever that you entertain a most erroneous notion concerning Italian women	294.7476310517409
I should have thought the continual failures you have met with in all your own love affairs might have taught you better by this time	169.29403592053723
Upon my soul these women would puzzle the very Devil to read them aright	820.8858844443706
Why herethey give you their handthey press yours in returnthey keep up a whispering conversationpermit you to accompany them home	1425.6287876832791
Why if a Parisian were to indulge in a quarter of these marks of flattering attention her reputation would be gone forever	248.4798609786886
And the very reason why the women of this fine country where sounds the si as Dante writes put so little restraint on their words and actions is because they live so much in public and have really nothing to conceal	324.9519912347196
Besides you must have perceived that the countess was really alarmed	104.7491758442288
At what At the sight of that respectable gentleman sitting opposite to us in the same box with the lovely Greek girl Now for my part I met them in the lobby after the conclusion of the piece and hang me if I can guess where you took your notions of the other world from	114.64247002851582
I can assure you that this hobgoblin of yours is a deuced finelooking fellowadmirably dressed	2247.8927457647255
Indeed I feel quite sure from the cut of his clothes they are made by a firstrate Paris tailorprobably Blin or Humann	424.6204186553273
He was rather too pale certainly but then you know paleness is always looked upon as a strong proof of aristocratic descent and distinguished breeding	518.5601431735274
Franz smiled for he well remembered that Albert particularly prided himself on the entire absence of color in his own complexion	259.3950340391751
Well that tends to confirm my own ideas said Franz that the countesss suspicions were destitute alike of sense and reason	542.0551128471644
Did he speak in your hearing and did you catch any of his words	113.16984951179681
I did but they were uttered in the Romaic dialect	253.37840607614666
I knew that from the mixture of Greek words	396.9752252980208
I do nt know whether I ever told you that when I was at college I was ratherrather strong in Greek	221.97144368507438
He spoke the Romaic language did he	179.5411688112445
But tell me what were you thinking about when I came in	49.65103902963429
Oh I was arranging a little surprise for you	78.14232881554922
Why you know it is quite impossible to procure a carriage	72.55045906156951
Certainly and I also know that we have done all that human means afforded to endeavor to get one	70.54129408033032
Now then in this difficulty a bright idea has flashed across my brain	210.08384269072755
Franz looked at Albert as though he had not much confidence in the suggestions of his imagination	54.92297975015466
Franz cried Albert you deserve to be called out for such a misgiving and incredulous glance as that you were pleased to bestow on me just now	129.65007325371968
And I promise to give you the satisfaction of a gentleman if your scheme turns out as ingenious as you assert	152.20392708438135
You agree do you not that obtaining a carriage is out of the question	154.6067689201163
True we have offered any sum but have failed	145.87111742747587
Well now what do you say to a cart I dare say such a thing might be had	92.52885034648085
As easily found as the cart	9294.449741311353
Then you see my good fellow with a cart and a couple of oxen our business can be managed	187.5331963928285
The cart must be tastefully ornamented and if you and I dress ourselves as Neapolitan reapers we may get up a striking tableau after the manner of that splendid picture by Lopold Robert	453.96295894614616
It would add greatly to the effect if the countess would join us in the costume of a peasant from Puzzoli or Sorrento	213.5985086388712
Our group would then be quite complete more especially as the countess is quite beautiful enough to represent a Madonna	194.81369760554077
Well said Franz this time M	346.24133110227393
Albert I am bound to give you credit for having hit upon a most capital idea	205.8664589056963
And quite a national one too replied Albert with gratified pride	411.0850059411572
A mere masque borrowed from our own festivities	450.12748663638223
Ha ha ye Romans you thought to make us unhappy strangers trot at the heels of your processions like so many lazzaroni because no carriages or horses are to be had in your beggarly city	333.5583952793055
But you do nt know us when we ca nt have one thing we invent another	110.66967473445146
And have you communicated your triumphant idea to anybody	1716.3195635515317
Upon my return home I sent for him and I then explained to him what I wished to procure	64.33392242844253
He assured me that nothing would be easier than to furnish all I desired	136.12556458616672
One thing I was sorry for when I bade him have the horns of the oxen gilded he told me there would not be time as it would require three days to do that so you see we must do without this little superfluity	127.53681730325114
Gone out in search of our equipage by tomorrow it might be too late	96.22248096034784
Then he will be able to give us an answer tonight	74.01854914851823
Oh I expect him every minute	2233.038957882983
At this instant the door opened and the head of Signor Pastrini appeared	42.40798376912619
Now then asked Albert eagerly have you found the desired cart and oxen	411.99999329393205
Better than that replied Signor Pastrini with the air of a man perfectly well satisfied with himself	41.22310301054037
Take care my worthy host said Albert better is a sure enemy to well	212.09811237793505
Let your excellencies only leave the matter to me returned Signor Pastrini in a tone indicative of unbounded selfconfidence	428.7331024980858
But what have you done asked Franz	194.69503792531054
Speak out there s a worthy fellow	374.59140596718015
Your excellencies are aware responded the landlord swelling with importance that the Count of Monte Cristo is living on the same floor with yourselves	71.48917540376256
I should think we did know it exclaimed Albert since it is owing to that circumstance that we are packed into these small rooms like two poor students in the back streets of Paris	174.54258168730672
When then the Count of Monte Cristo hearing of the dilemma in which you are placed has sent to offer you seats in his carriage and two places at his windows in the Palazzo Rospoli	121.32255120471989
The friends looked at each other with unutterable surprise	89.53808033428056
But do you think asked Albert that we ought to accept such offers from a perfect stranger	188.15895746247008
What sort of person is this Count of Monte Cristo asked Franz of his host	39.13656955248818
A very great nobleman but whether Maltese or Sicilian I can not exactly say but this I know that he is noble as a Borghese and rich as a gold mine	202.1112669821744
It seems to me said Franz speaking in an undertone to Albert that if this person merited the high panegyrics of our landlord he would have conveyed his invitation through another channel and not permitted it to be brought to us in this unceremonious way	223.80195052576468
At this instant someone knocked at the door	5.254788689114103
A servant wearing a livery of considerable style and richness appeared at the threshold and placing two cards in the landlords hands who forthwith presented them to the two young men he said	149.3590660668959
Please to deliver these from the Count of Monte Cristo to Vicomte Albert de Morcerf and M	25.408595350523782
The Count of Monte Cristo continued the servant begs these gentlemens permission to wait upon them as their neighbor and he will be honored by an intimation of what time they will please to receive him	201.8651616466775
Faith Franz whispered Albert there is not much to find fault with here	118.84167980939662
Tell the count replied Franz that we will do ourselves the pleasure of calling on him	52.527722488581965
That is what I call an elegant mode of attack said Albert You were quite correct in what you said Signor Pastrini	341.76766965965777
The Count of Monte Cristo is unquestionably a man of firstrate breeding and knowledge of the world	153.03557099986733
Then you accept his offer said the host	39.44929140605249
Of course we do replied Albert	167.96673358730888
Still I must own I am sorry to be obliged to give up the cart and the group of reapersit would have produced such an effect And were it not for the windows at the Palazzo Rospoli by way of recompense for the loss of our beautiful scheme I do nt know but what I should have held on by my original plan	96.98906764078288
Oh I agree with you the windows in the Palazzo Rospoli alone decided me	526.1066782686349
The truth was that the mention of two places in the Palazzo Rospoli had recalled to Franz the conversation he had overheard the preceding evening in the ruins of the Colosseum between the mysterious unknown and the Transteverin in which the stranger in the cloak had undertaken to obtain the freedom of a condemned criminal and if this muffledup individual proved as Franz felt sure he would the same as the person he had just seen in the Teatro Argentina then he should be able to establish his identity and also to prosecute his researches respecting him with perfect facility and freedom	175.95441052921134
Franz passed the night in confused dreams respecting the two meetings he had already had with his mysterious tormentor and in waking speculations as to what the morrow would produce	391.13024548506075
The next day must clear up every doubt and unless his near neighbor and wouldbe friend the Count of Monte Cristo possessed the ring of Gyges and by its power was able to render himself invisible it was very certain he could not escape this time	122.02726759403738
Eight oclock found Franz up and dressed while Albert who had not the same motives for early rising was still soundly asleep	141.6736302954113
The first act of Franz was to summon his landlord who presented himself with his accustomed obsequiousness	128.0435373481235
Pray Signor Pastrini asked Franz is not some execution appointed to take place today	175.69336061598858
Yes your excellency but if your reason for inquiry is that you may procure a window to view it from you are much too late	116.32570848394009
Oh no answered Franz I had no such intention and even if I had felt a wish to witness the spectacle I might have done so from Monte Pincio could I not	88.45620346012593
Ah exclaimed mine host I did not think it likely your excellency would have chosen to mingle with such a rabble as are always collected on that hill which indeed they consider as exclusively belonging to themselves	232.37344944722133
Very possibly I may not go answered Franz but in case I feel disposed give me some particulars of todays executions	211.4133906217075
What particulars would your excellency like to hear	211.5994627905026
Why the number of persons condemned to suffer their names and description of the death they are to die	157.33853438630862
That happens just lucky your excellency Only a few minutes ago they brought me the tavolettas	224.3435821683569
Sort of wooden tablets hung up at the corners of streets the evening before an execution on which is pasted up a paper containing the names of the condemned persons their crimes and mode of punishment	154.09144951912313
The reason for so publicly announcing all this is that all good and faithful Catholics may offer up their prayers for the unfortunate culprits and above all beseech of Heaven to grant them a sincere repentance	301.1848171238735
And these tablets are brought to you that you may add your prayers to those of the faithful are they asked Franz somewhat incredulously	133.85811514267792
Oh dear no your excellency I have not time for anybodys affairs but my own and those of my honorable guests but I make an agreement with the man who pastes up the papers and he brings them to me as he would the playbills that in case any person staying at my hotel should like to witness an execution he may obtain every requisite information concerning the time and place etc	213.0850379972175
Upon my word that is a most delicate attention on your part Signor Pastrini cried Franz	315.4314363336589
Why your excellency returned the landlord chuckling and rubbing his hands with infinite complacency I think I may take upon myself to say I neglect nothing to deserve the support and patronage of the noble visitors to this poor hotel	206.97301461644145
I see that plainly enough my most excellent host and you may rely upon me to proclaim so striking a proof of your attention to your guests wherever I go	94.63000344864962
Meanwhile oblige me by a sight of one of these tavolettas	104.3513406159729
Nothing can be easier than to comply with your excellencys wish said the landlord opening the door of the chamber I have caused one to be placed on the landing close by your apartment	81.15480323278886
Then taking the tablet from the wall he handed it to Franz who read as follows	67.0771913792718
The public is informed that on Wednesday February 23rd being the first day of the Carnival executions will take place in the Piazza del Popolo by order of the Tribunal of the Rota of two persons named Andrea Rondolo and Peppino otherwise called Rocca Priori the former found guilty of the murder of a venerable and exemplary priest named Don Csar Torlini canon of the church of St	385.5977430544184
John Lateran and the latter convicted of being an accomplice of the atrocious and sanguinary bandit Luigi Vampa and his band	414.38654913509794
The firstnamed malefactor will be mazzolato the second culprit decapitato	4116.6227346105115
The prayers of all good Christians are entreated for these unfortunate men that it may please God to awaken them to a sense of their guilt and to grant them a hearty and sincere repentance for their crimes	236.03383472236175
This was precisely what Franz had heard the evening before in the ruins of the Colosseum	33.51362389302681
No part of the programme differedthe names of the condemned persons their crimes and mode of punishment all agreed with his previous information	538.0749661535125
In all probability therefore the Transteverin was no other than the bandit Luigi Vampa himself and the man shrouded in the mantle the same he had known as Sinbad the Sailor but who no doubt was still pursuing his philanthropic expedition in Rome as he had already done at PortoVecchio and Tunis	201.7285201795068
Time was getting on however and Franz deemed it advisable to awaken Albert but at the moment he prepared to proceed to his chamber his friend entered the room in perfect costume for the day	123.79712587859909
The anticipated delights of the Carnival had so run in his head as to make him leave his pillow long before his usual hour	111.70662636142991
Now my excellent Signor Pastrini said Franz addressing his landlord since we are both ready do you think we may proceed at once to visit the Count of Monte Cristo	44.3208023538488
The Count of Monte Cristo is always an early riser and I can answer for his having been up these two hours	140.24296164828908
Then you really consider we shall not be intruding if we pay our respects to him directly	59.45545461682124
I will take all the blame on myself if you find I have led you into an error	131.62996558743384
Well then if it be so are you ready Albert	414.27818990986094
Let us go and return our best thanks for his courtesy	214.1524728972649
The landlord preceded the friends across the landing which was all that separated them from the apartments of the count rang at the bell and upon the door being opened by a servant said	63.546886614647526
The domestic bowed respectfully and invited them to enter	142.69131259357056
They passed through two rooms furnished in a luxurious manner they had not expected to see under the roof of Signor Pastrini and were shown into an elegantly fittedup drawingroom	260.60163160950543
The richest Turkey carpets covered the floor and the softest and most inviting couches easychairs and sofas offered their highpiled and yielding cushions to such as desired repose or refreshment	1079.3272076985872
Splendid paintings by the first masters were ranged against the walls intermingled with magnificent trophies of war while heavy curtains of costly tapestry were suspended before the different doors of the room	414.419749610754
If your excellencies will please to be seated said the man I will let the count know that you are here	39.39273785759088
And with these words he disappeared behind one of the tapestried portires	322.1283970908807
As the door opened the sound of a guzla reached the ears of the young men but was almost immediately lost for the rapid closing of the door merely allowed one rich swell of harmony to enter	155.28149084363872
Franz and Albert looked inquiringly at each other then at the gorgeous furnishings of the apartment	67.8848733726017
Everything seemed more magnificent at a second view than it had done at their first rapid survey	188.6931216333205
Well said Franz to his friend what think you of all this	98.7012713556815
Why upon my soul my dear fellow it strikes me that our elegant and attentive neighbor must either be some successful stockjobber who has speculated in the fall of the Spanish funds or some prince travelling incog	431.3819719379748
Hush hush replied Franz we shall ascertain who and what he ishe comes	367.47397880240095
As Franz spoke he heard the sound of a door turning on its hinges and almost immediately afterwards the tapestry was drawn aside and the owner of all these riches stood before the two young men	58.97364469774608
Albert instantly rose to meet him but Franz remained in a manner spellbound on his chair for in the person of him who had just entered he recognized not only the mysterious visitant to the Colosseum and the occupant of the box at the Teatro Argentina but also his extraordinary host of Monte Cristo	101.78663215714417
Gentlemen said the Count of Monte Cristo as he entered I pray you excuse me for suffering my visit to be anticipated but I feared to disturb you by presenting myself earlier at your apartments besides you sent me word that you would come to me and I have held myself at your disposal	74.20529228337455
Franz and I have to thank you a thousand times count returned Albert you extricated us from a great dilemma and we were on the point of inventing a very fantastic vehicle when your friendly invitation reached us	290.1851849104634
Indeed returned the count motioning the two young men to sit down	21.96597961848351
It was the fault of that blockhead Pastrini that I did not sooner assist you in your distress	350.0398238957039
He did not mention a syllable of your embarrassment to me when he knows that alone and isolated as I am I seek every opportunity of making the acquaintance of my neighbors	145.88990540540155
As soon as I learned I could in any way assist you I most eagerly seized the opportunity of offering my services	201.4912767748484
Franz had as yet found nothing to say he had come to no determination and as nothing in the counts manner manifested the wish that he should recognize him he did not know whether to make any allusion to the past or wait until he had more proof besides although sure it was he who had been in the box the previous evening he could not be equally positive that this was the man he had seen at the Colosseum	83.0421420155634
He resolved therefore to let things take their course without making any direct overture to the count	168.61933761509172
Moreover he had this advantage he was master of the counts secret while the count had no hold on Franz who had nothing to conceal	71.97701761552572
However he resolved to lead the conversation to a subject which might possibly clear up his doubts	219.42785218685373
Count said he you have offered us places in your carriage and at your windows in the Rospoli Palace	212.10143384718572
Can you tell us where we can obtain a sight of the Piazza del Popolo	66.89322923193069
Ah said the count negligently looking attentively at Morcerf is there not something like an execution upon the Piazza del Popolo	179.68933716697737
Yes returned Franz finding that the count was coming to the point he wished	29.442944403805402
Stay I think I told my steward yesterday to attend to this perhaps I can render you this slight service also	198.75115214662625
He extended his hand and rang the bell thrice	125.80635096134269
Did you ever occupy yourself said he to Franz with the employment of time and the means of simplifying the summoning your servants I have	103.21632861658938
When I ring once it is for my valet twice for my majordomo thrice for my stewardthus I do not waste a minute or a word	187.4710998823646
A man of about fortyfive or fifty entered exactly resembling the smuggler who had introduced Franz into the cavern but he did not appear to recognize him	139.93034329198275
It was evident he had his orders	143.44982150948837
Monsieur Bertuccio said the count you have procured me windows looking on the Piazza del Popolo as I ordered you yesterday	82.12810154447882
Yes excellency returned the steward but it was very late	33.00549060813823
Did I not tell you I wished for one replied the count frowning	69.71396353490914
And your excellency has one which was let to Prince Lobanieff but I was obliged to pay a hundred	99.68763093094594
That will dothat will do Monsieur Bertuccio spare these gentlemen all such domestic arrangements	833.3882141439593
You have the window that is sufficient	224.32273996092044
Give orders to the coachman and be in readiness on the stairs to conduct us to it	86.41589192292105
The steward bowed and was about to quit the room	23.369388794850536
Ah continued the count be good enough to ask Pastrini if he has received the tavoletta and if he can send us an account of the execution	97.5942832668759
There is no need to do that said Franz taking out his tablets for I saw the account and copied it down	123.97175355175074
Very well you can retire M	83.85327667880871
Bertuccio I need you no longer	2.8576649488341523
Let us know when breakfast is ready	57.8437320275978
These gentlemen added he turning to the two friends will I trust do me the honor to breakfast with me	40.88153645641269
But my dear count said Albert we shall abuse your kindness	276.8599303688327
Not at all on the contrary you will give me great pleasure	33.58038190375408
You will one or other of you perhaps both return it to me at Paris	111.0049923291254
He then took Franzs tablets out of his hand	13.164516673039074
We announce he read in the same tone with which he would have read a newspaper that today the 23rd of February will be executed Andrea Rondolo guilty of murder on the person of the respected and venerated Don Csar Torlini canon of the church of St	134.3795046663199
John Lateran and Peppino called Rocca Priori convicted of complicity with the detestable bandit Luigi Vampa and the men of his band	464.67118749352255
Hum The first will be mazzolato the second decapitato	2202.3398417192616
Yes continued the count it was at first arranged in this way but I think since yesterday some change has taken place in the order of the ceremony	64.06393570811441
Yes I passed the evening at the Cardinal Rospigliosis and there mention was made of something like a pardon for one of the two men	153.79044405091224
No replied the count carelessly for the other he glanced at the tablets as if to recall the name for Peppino called Rocca Priori	198.42962344008592
You are thus deprived of seeing a man guillotined but the mazzolata still remains which is a very curious punishment when seen for the first time and even the second while the other as you must know is very simple	162.44407085793046
The mandaa6 never fails never trembles never strikes thirty times ineffectually like the soldier who beheaded the Count of Chalais and to whose tender mercy Richelieu had doubtless recommended the sufferer	728.6124709695481
Ah added the count in a contemptuous tone do not tell me of European punishments they are in the infancy or rather the old age of cruelty	118.28540072546195
Really count replied Franz one would think that you had studied the different tortures of all the nations of the world	61.802876670420815
There are at least few that I have not seen said the count coldly	35.95400045715959
And you took pleasure in beholding these dreadful spectacles	3664.5937211983987
My first sentiment was horror the second indifference the third curiosity	359.2600555014745
Why so In life our greatest preoccupation is death is it not then curious to study the different ways by which the soul and body can part and how according to their different characters temperaments and even the different customs of their countries different persons bear the transition from life to death from existence to annihilation As for myself I can assure you of one thingthe more men you see die the easier it becomes to die yourself and in my opinion death may be a torture but it is not an expiation	267.2435021272928
I do not quite understand you replied Franz pray explain your meaning for you excite my curiosity to the highest pitch	381.1035969406582
Listen said the count and deep hatred mounted to his face as the blood would to the face of any other	111.13641185887103
If a man had by unheardof and excruciating tortures destroyed your father your mother your betrotheda being who when torn from you left a desolation a wound that never closes in your breastdo you think the reparation that society gives you is sufficient when it interposes the knife of the guillotine between the base of the occiput and the trapezal muscles of the murderer and allows him who has caused us years of moral sufferings to escape with a few moments of physical pain	431.7173782478541
Yes I know said Franz that human justice is insufficient to console us she can give blood in return for blood that is all but you must demand from her only what it is in her power to grant	150.51754333410284
I will put another case to you continued the count that where society attacked by the death of a person avenges death by death	144.43495845106625
But are there not a thousand tortures by which a man may be made to suffer without society taking the least cognizance of them or offering him even the insufficient means of vengeance of which we have just spoken Are there not crimes for which the impalement of the Turks the augers of the Persians the stake and the brand of the Iroquois Indians are inadequate tortures and which are unpunished by society Answer me do not these crimes exist	244.7227346238151
Yes answered Franz and it is to punish them that duelling is tolerated	370.1390170849739
Ah duelling cried the count a pleasant manner upon my soul of arriving at your end when that end is vengeance A man has carried off your mistress a man has seduced your wife a man has dishonored your daughter he has rendered the whole life of one who had the right to expect from Heaven that portion of happiness God has promised to everyone of his creatures an existence of misery and infamy and you think you are avenged because you send a ball through the head or pass a sword through the breast of that man who has planted madness in your brain and despair in your heart	145.3450929111169
And remember moreover that it is often he who comes off victorious from the strife absolved of all crime in the eyes of the world	126.54367012276244
No no continued the count had I to avenge myself it is not thus I would take revenge	72.43694554596468
Then you disapprove of duelling You would not fight a duel asked Albert in his turn astonished at this strange theory	140.5414076859936
Oh yes replied the count understand me I would fight a duel for a trifle for an insult for a blow and the more so that thanks to my skill in all bodily exercises and the indifference to danger I have gradually acquired I should be almost certain to kill my man	154.3718265222294
Oh I would fight for such a cause but in return for a slow profound eternal torture I would give back the same were it possible an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth as the Orientalists sayour masters in everythingthose favored creatures who have formed for themselves a life of dreams and a paradise of realities	393.4163020395296
But said Franz to the count with this theory which renders you at once judge and executioner of your own cause it would be difficult to adopt a course that would forever prevent your falling under the power of the law	115.40637072115109
Hatred is blind rage carries you away and he who pours out vengeance runs the risk of tasting a bitter draught	564.1399399859663
Yes if he be poor and inexperienced not if he be rich and skilful besides the worst that could happen to him would be the punishment of which we have already spoken and which the philanthropic French Revolution has substituted for being torn to pieces by horses or broken on the wheel	212.62986072075245
What matters this punishment as long as he is avenged On my word I almost regret that in all probability this miserable Peppino will not be beheaded as you might have had an opportunity then of seeing how short a time the punishment lasts and whether it is worth even mentioning but really this is a most singular conversation for the Carnival gentlemen how did it arise Ah I recollect you asked for a place at my window you shall have it but let us first sit down to table for here comes the servant to inform us that breakfast is ready	154.93112565437335
As he spoke a servant opened one of the four doors of the apartment saying	52.26626265888167
The two young men arose and entered the breakfastroom	156.19069489535985
During the meal which was excellent and admirably served Franz looked repeatedly at Albert in order to observe the impressions which he doubted not had been made on him by the words of their entertainer but whether with his usual carelessness he had paid but little attention to him whether the explanation of the Count of Monte Cristo with regard to duelling had satisfied him or whether the events which Franz knew of had had their effect on him alone he remarked that his companion did not pay the least regard to them but on the contrary ate like a man who for the last four or five months had been condemned to partake of Italian cookerythat is the worst in the world	98.66363195050211
As for the count he just touched the dishes he seemed to fulfil the duties of a host by sitting down with his guests and awaited their departure to be served with some strange or more delicate food	139.57923176663104
This brought back to Franz in spite of himself the recollection of the terror with which the count had inspired the Countess G and her firm conviction that the man in the opposite box was a vampire	91.40810509212423
At the end of the breakfast Franz took out his watch	201.37543726237988
Well said the count what are you doing	10.557025640262093
You must excuse us count returned Franz but we have still much to do	61.02780512274
We have no masks and it is absolutely necessary to procure them	82.9286566262178
Do not concern yourself about that we have I think a private room in the Piazza del Popolo I will have whatever costumes you choose brought to us and you can dress there	135.79060478437543
Before or after whichever you please	167.38267364723256
The scaffold forms part of the fte	378.62357699321274
Count I have reflected on the matter said Franz I thank you for your courtesy but I shall content myself with accepting a place in your carriage and at your window at the Rospoli Palace and I leave you at liberty to dispose of my place at the Piazza del Popolo	76.2623973879156
But I warn you you will lose a very curious sight returned the count	95.38526374477388
You will describe it to me replied Franz and the recital from your lips will make as great an impression on me as if I had witnessed it	74.80233002780602
I have more than once intended witnessing an execution but I have never been able to make up my mind and you Albert	92.0700924580536
I replied the viscountI saw Castaing executed but I think I was rather intoxicated that day for I had quitted college the same morning and we had passed the previous night at a tavern	245.1829857802154
Besides it is no reason because you have not seen an execution at Paris that you should not see one anywhere else when you travel it is to see everything	88.05393117406204
Think what a figure you will make when you are asked How do they execute at Rome and you reply I do not know And besides they say that the culprit is an infamous scoundrel who killed with a log of wood a worthy canon who had brought him up like his own son	146.08862561293918
Diable when a churchman is killed it should be with a different weapon than a log especially when he has behaved like a father	193.99886458003454
If you went to Spain would you not see the bullfights Well suppose it is a bullfight you are going to see Recollect the ancient Romans of the Circus and the sports where they killed three hundred lions and a hundred men	196.59668276317106
Think of the eighty thousand applauding spectators the sage matrons who took their daughters and the charming Vestals who made with the thumb of their white hands the fatal sign that said Come despatch the dying	307.55480536440905
Shall you go then Albert asked Franz	235.26177797711637
Ma foi yes like you I hesitated but the counts eloquence decides me	696.325387776826
Let us go then said Franz since you wish it but on our way to the Piazza del Popolo I wish to pass through the Corso	66.31212672718247
On foot yes in a carriage no	261.905280101252
I will go on foot then	59.202208280587136
Is it important that you should go that way	177.06164278196496
Yes there is something I wish to see	18.79400283815944
Well we will go by the Corso	346.08701695297293
We will send the carriage to wait for us on the Piazza del Popolo by the Via del Babuino for I shall be glad to pass myself through the Corso to see if some orders I have given have been executed	88.03737971596864
Excellency said a servant opening the door a man in the dress of a penitent wishes to speak to you	37.759788154612835
Ah yes returned the count I know who he is gentlemen will you return to the salon you will find good cigars on the centre table	121.5645272604091
I will be with you directly	1399.0028539390669
The young men rose and returned into the salon while the count again apologizing left by another door	191.24479595578802
Albert who was a great smoker and who had considered it no small sacrifice to be deprived of the cigars of the Caf de Paris approached the table and uttered a cry of joy at perceiving some veritable puros	104.40690395561685
Well asked Franz what think you of the Count of Monte Cristo	7.401219898727653
What do I think said Albert evidently surprised at such a question from his companion I think he is a delightful fellow who does the honors of his table admirably who has travelled much read much is like Brutus of the Stoic school and moreover added he sending a volume of smoke up towards the ceiling that he has excellent cigars	193.91268828676925
Such was Alberts opinion of the count and as Franz well knew that Albert professed never to form an opinion except upon long reflection he made no attempt to change it	181.58878334915997
But said he did you observe one very singular thing	376.10846302782625
How attentively he looked at you	75.5350931881856
Ah replied he sighing that is not very surprising I have been more than a year absent from Paris and my clothes are of a most antiquated cut the count takes me for a provincial	131.1987007856498
The first opportunity you have undeceive him I beg and tell him I am nothing of the kind	82.93781530063667
Franz smiled an instant after the count entered	19.203431231584112
I am now quite at your service gentlemen said he	42.34423769084303
The carriage is going one way to the Piazza del Popolo and we will go another and if you please by the Corso	61.46220595777541
Take some more of these cigars M	1843.5802189603967
With all my heart returned Albert Italian cigars are horrible	2356.5271491788358
When you come to Paris I will return all this	29.921582017550744
I will not refuse I intend going there soon and since you allow me I will pay you a visit	82.3275961482213
Come we have not any time to lose it is halfpast twelvelet us set off	104.10307708310481
All three descended the coachman received his masters orders and drove down the Via del Babuino	182.0964994107995
While the three gentlemen walked along the Piazza di Spagna and the Via Frattina which led directly between the Fiano and Rospoli palaces Franzs attention was directed towards the windows of that last palace for he had not forgotten the signal agreed upon between the man in the mantle and the Transtevere peasant	230.31698706117024
Which are your windows asked he of the count with as much indifference as he could assume	61.11199177218619
The three last returned he with a negligence evidently unaffected for he could not imagine with what intention the question was put	237.511514870819
Franz glanced rapidly towards the three windows	462.49424396984034
The side windows were hung with yellow damask and the centre one with white damask and a red cross	42.92388472473636
The man in the mantle had kept his promise to the Transteverin and there could now be no doubt that he was the count	73.4643779770508
The three windows were still untenanted	427199.6845898053
Preparations were making on every side chairs were placed scaffolds were raised and windows were hung with flags	397.17413329561396
The masks could not appear the carriages could not move about but the masks were visible behind the windows the carriages and the doors	93.14447302561548
Franz Albert and the count continued to descend the Corso	201.60244655133704
As they approached the Piazza del Popolo the crowd became more dense and above the heads of the multitude two objects were visible the obelisk surmounted by a cross which marks the centre of the square and in front of the obelisk at the point where the three streets del Babuino del Corso and di Ripetta meet the two uprights of the scaffold between which glittered the curved knife of the mandaa	167.57479605476047
At the corner of the street they met the counts steward who was awaiting his master	64.92688663770564
The window let at an exorbitant price which the count had doubtless wished to conceal from his guests was on the second floor of the great palace situated between the Via del Babuino and the Monte Pincio	109.61415398814988
It consisted as we have said of a small dressingroom opening into a bedroom and when the door of communication was shut the inmates were quite alone	99.93360773767411
On chairs were laid elegant masquerade costumes of blue and white satin	376.3891823703367
As you left the choice of your costumes to me said the count to the two friends I have had these brought as they will be the most worn this year and they are most suitable on account of the confetti sweetmeats as they do not show the flour	112.65167474111692
Franz heard the words of the count but imperfectly and he perhaps did not fully appreciate this new attention to their wishes for he was wholly absorbed by the spectacle that the Piazza del Popolo presented and by the terrible instrument that was in the centre	133.9081229861142
It was the first time Franz had ever seen a guillotinewe say guillotine because the Roman mandaa is formed on almost the same model as the French instrument	445.9423001524257
7 The knife which is shaped like a crescent that cuts with the convex side falls from a less height and that is all the difference	248.56644802186176
Two men seated on the movable plank on which the victim is laid were eating their breakfasts while waiting for the criminal	581.3666060765802
Their repast consisted apparently of bread and sausages	772.7867330218071
One of them lifted the plank took out a flask of wine drank some and then passed it to his companion	161.87643273790533
These two men were the executioners assistants	77017.51475676251
At this sight Franz felt the perspiration start forth upon his brow	74.52462219223632
The prisoners transported the previous evening from the Carceri Nuove to the little church of Santa Maria del Popolo had passed the night each accompanied by two priests in a chapel closed by a grating before which were two sentinels who were relieved at intervals	181.15212730154423
A double line of carbineers placed on each side of the door of the church reached to the scaffold and formed a circle around it leaving a path about ten feet wide and around the guillotine a space of nearly a hundred feet	76.24557278981837
All the rest of the square was paved with heads	504.77565560589926
Many women held their infants on their shoulders and thus the children had the best view	95.4594735765342
The Monte Pincio seemed a vast amphitheatre filled with spectators the balconies of the two churches at the corner of the Via del Babuino and the Via di Ripetta were crammed the steps even seemed a particolored sea that was impelled towards the portico every niche in the wall held its living statue	289.6094457990077
What the count said was truethe most curious spectacle in life is that of death	360.3058773645571
And yet instead of the silence and the solemnity demanded by the occasion laughter and jests arose from the crowd	246.61311708712046
It was evident that the execution was in the eyes of the people only the commencement of the Carnival	84.2121673749059
Suddenly the tumult ceased as if by magic and the doors of the church opened	56.54830893871049
A brotherhood of penitents clothed from head to foot in robes of gray sackcloth with holes for the eyes and holding in their hands lighted tapers appeared first the chief marched at the head	250.78947517894022
Behind the penitents came a man of vast stature and proportions	500.10287560500416
He was naked with the exception of cloth drawers at the left side of which hung a large knife in a sheath and he bore on his right shoulder a heavy iron sledgehammer	130.88954330735663
He had moreover sandals bound on his feet by cords	178.66789639520485
Behind the executioner came in the order in which they were to die first Peppino and then Andrea	108.18924193404642
Each was accompanied by two priests	312.9555992583973
Peppino walked with a firm step doubtless aware of what awaited him	221.20717727565165
Andrea was supported by two priests	354.15638417678315
Each of them from time to time kissed the crucifix a confessor held out to them	142.49612584883704
At this sight alone Franz felt his legs tremble under him	34.803722186359984
He looked at Alberthe was as white as his shirt and mechanically cast away his cigar although he had not half smoked it	222.8802139193282
The count alone seemed unmovednay more a slight color seemed striving to rise in his pale cheeks	99.85588795763361
His nostrils dilated like those of a wild beast that scents its prey and his lips half opened disclosed his white teeth small and sharp like those of a jackal	173.95575633866167
And yet his features wore an expression of smiling tenderness such as Franz had never before witnessed in them his black eyes especially were full of kindness and pity	128.95919156366955
However the two culprits advanced and as they approached their faces became visible	116.72605619597186
Peppino was a handsome young man of four or fiveandtwenty bronzed by the sun he carried his head erect and seemed on the watch to see on which side his liberator would appear	187.59109421371068
Andrea was short and fat his visage marked with brutal cruelty did not indicate age he might be thirty	407.3092544499732
In prison he had suffered his beard to grow his head fell on his shoulder his legs bent beneath him and his movements were apparently automatic and unconscious	127.5486323999125
I thought said Franz to the count that you told me there would be but one execution	58.68714973522118
I told you true replied he coldly	164.7584178178383
And yet here are two culprits	91340.62081678864
Yes but only one of these two is about to die the other has many years to live	99.29924933135285
If the pardon is to come there is no time to lose	23.93648875240499
And see here it is said the count	11.455002046927694
At the moment when Peppino reached the foot of the mandaa a priest arrived in some haste forced his way through the soldiers and advancing to the chief of the brotherhood gave him a folded paper	111.79239222472748
The piercing eye of Peppino had noticed all	62.421208215243595
The chief took the paper unfolded it and raising his hand Heaven be praised and his Holiness also said he in a loud voice here is a pardon for one of the prisoners	105.77073139601639
A pardon cried the people with one voice a pardon	352.95529298553834
At this cry Andrea raised his head	1.7987037434738868
A pardon for Peppino called Rocca Priori said the principal friar	1086.742096552279
And he passed the paper to the officer commanding the carbineers who read and returned it to him	134.44872123647994
For Peppino cried Andrea who seemed roused from the torpor in which he had been plunged	71.70723820996614
Why for him and not for me We ought to die together	103.69907915639628
I was promised he should die with me	13.037690482899784
You have no right to put me to death alone	123.1792596400389
I will not die aloneI will not	10.408884411865674
And he broke from the priests struggling and raving like a wild beast and striving desperately to break the cords that bound his hands	362.4440299645219
The executioner made a sign and his two assistants leaped from the scaffold and seized him	115.11600200752423
What is going on asked Franz of the count for as all the talk was in the Roman dialect he had not perfectly understood it	87.38933803875042
Do you not see returned the count that this human creature who is about to die is furious that his fellowsufferer does not perish with him and were he able he would rather tear him to pieces with his teeth and nails than let him enjoy the life he himself is about to be deprived of	122.58151707239789
Oh man manrace of crocodiles cried the count extending his clenched hands towards the crowd how well do I recognize you there and that at all times you are worthy of yourselves	82.18444414455789
Meanwhile Andrea and the two executioners were struggling on the ground and he kept exclaiming He ought to diehe shall dieI will not die alone	243.64562292569573
Look look cried the count seizing the young mens hands look for on my soul it is curious	182.89200322044894
Here is a man who had resigned himself to his fate who was going to the scaffold to dielike a coward it is true but he was about to die without resistance	87.63896597331563
Do you know what gave him strength do you know what consoled him It was that another partook of his punishmentthat another partook of his anguishthat another was to die before him Lead two sheep to the butchers two oxen to the slaughterhouse and make one of them understand that his companion will not die the sheep will bleat for pleasure the ox will bellow with joy	257.33456752960467
But manman whom God created in his own imageman upon whom God has laid his first his sole commandment to love his neighborman to whom God has given a voice to express his thoughtswhat is his first cry when he hears his fellowman is saved A blasphemy	330.6029319807905
Honor to man this masterpiece of nature this king of the creation	215.73271890491193
And the count burst into a laugh a terrible laugh that showed he must have suffered horribly to be able thus to laugh	177.24993986447214
However the struggle still continued and it was dreadful to witness	46.83372590120659
The two assistants carried Andrea up to the scaffold the people all took part against Andrea and twenty thousand voices cried Put him to death put him to death	179.73212507648645
Franz sprang back but the count seized his arm and held him before the window	19.18239972075583
What are you doing said he	17.522112245745546
Do you pity him If you heard the cry of Mad dog you would take your gunyou would unhesitatingly shoot the poor beast who after all was only guilty of having been bitten by another dog	220.50683124910393
And yet you pity a man who without being bitten by one of his race has yet murdered his benefactor and who now unable to kill anyone because his hands are bound wishes to see his companion in captivity perish	157.19691143821166
Franz was fascinated by the horrible spectacle	1345.3575362673914
The two assistants had borne Andrea to the scaffold and there in spite of his struggles his bites and his cries had forced him to his knees	127.82337548995365
During this time the executioner had raised his mace and signed to them to get out of the way the criminal strove to rise but ere he had time the mace fell on his left temple	152.2893026712174
A dull and heavy sound was heard and the man dropped like an ox on his face and then turned over on his back	32.48914238986266
The executioner let fall his mace drew his knife and with one stroke opened his throat and mounting on his stomach stamped violently on it with his feet	115.80484039311312
At every stroke a jet of blood sprang from the wound	31.010527329743482
This time Franz could contain himself no longer but sank half fainting into a seat	77.47922675883949
Albert with his eyes closed was standing grasping the windowcurtains	1132.1837319952838
The count was erect and triumphant like the Avenging Angel	3491.7506798366994
When Franz recovered his senses he saw Albert drinking a glass of water of which to judge from his pallor he stood in great need and the count who was assuming his masquerade costume	136.67013036552007
He glanced mechanically towards the piazzathe scene was wholly changed scaffold executioners victims all had disappeared only the people remained full of noise and excitement	910.1042556859558
The bell of Monte Citorio which only sounds on the popes decease and the opening of the Carnival was ringing a joyous peal	393.18602952644227
Well asked he of the count what has then happened	168.3221363236569
Nothing replied the count only as you see the Carnival has commenced	141.18362121337486
In fact said Franz this horrible scene has passed away like a dream	56.39530865240372
It is but a dream a nightmare that has disturbed you	261.11689708455754
Yes that I have suffered but the culprit	234.83884148778705
That is a dream also only he has remained asleep while you have awakened and who knows which of you is the most fortunate	119.61932473852822
But Peppinowhat has become of him	33.81521936843499
Peppino is a lad of sense who unlike most men who are happy in proportion as they are noticed was delighted to see that the general attention was directed towards his companion	125.1918894457218
He profited by this distraction to slip away among the crowd without even thanking the worthy priests who accompanied him	188.68068662501773
Decidedly man is an ungrateful and egotistical animal	4560.135596045323
de Morcerf sets you the example	2340.860974194287
Albert was drawing on the satin pantaloon over his black trousers and varnished boots	865.877611848475
Well Albert said Franz do you feel much inclined to join the revels Come answer frankly	565.8905829794205
But I am really glad to have seen such a sight and I understand what the count saidthat when you have once habituated yourself to a similar spectacle it is the only one that causes you any emotion	140.35172316132665
Without reflecting that this is the only moment in which you can study character said the count on the steps of the scaffold death tears off the mask that has been worn through life and the real visage is disclosed	118.26780911651933
It must be allowed that Andrea was not very handsome the hideous scoundrel Come dress yourselves gentlemen dress yourselves	1249.8700510652932
Franz felt it would be ridiculous not to follow his two companions example	370.0704850550467
He assumed his costume and fastened on the mask that scarcely equalled the pallor of his own face	117.72868159680137
Their toilet finished they descended the carriage awaited them at the door filled with sweetmeats and bouquets	113.23063782757747
They fell into the line of carriages	133.94694666785875
It is difficult to form an idea of the perfect change that had taken place	67.15619032811728
Instead of the spectacle of gloomy and silent death the Piazza del Popolo presented a spectacle of gay and noisy mirth and revelry	333.730750274012
A crowd of masks flowed in from all sides emerging from the doors descending from the windows	143.03863743979997
From every street and every corner drove carriages filled with clowns harlequins dominoes mummers pantomimists Transteverins knights and peasants screaming fighting gesticulating throwing eggs filled with flour confetti nosegays attacking with their sarcasms and their missiles friends and foes companions and strangers indiscriminately and no one took offence or did anything but laugh	1947.215202057791
Franz and Albert were like men who to drive away a violent sorrow have recourse to wine and who as they drink and become intoxicated feel a thick veil drawn between the past and the present	209.56653871652006
They saw or rather continued to see the image of what they had witnessed but little by little the general vertigo seized them and they felt themselves obliged to take part in the noise and confusion	159.40365179864565
A handful of confetti that came from a neighboring carriage and which while it covered Morcerf and his two companions with dust pricked his neck and that portion of his face uncovered by his mask like a hundred pins incited him to join in the general combat in which all the masks around him were engaged	152.86274007379814
He rose in his turn and seizing handfuls of confetti and sweetmeats with which the carriage was filled cast them with all the force and skill he was master of	158.0957636127871
The strife had fairly begun and the recollection of what they had seen half an hour before was gradually effaced from the young mens minds so much were they occupied by the gay and glittering procession they now beheld	123.26017770810849
As for the Count of Monte Cristo he had never for an instant shown any appearance of having been moved	94.42031750796627
Imagine the large and splendid Corso bordered from one end to the other with lofty palaces with their balconies hung with carpets and their windows with flags	343.36654384754854
At these balconies are three hundred thousand spectatorsRomans Italians strangers from all parts of the world the united aristocracy of birth wealth and genius	268.5056654694532
Lovely women yielding to the influence of the scene bend over their balconies or lean from their windows and shower down confetti which are returned by bouquets the air seems darkened with the falling confetti and flying flowers	535.1907348471915
In the streets the lively crowd is dressed in the most fantastic costumesgigantic cabbages walk gravely about buffaloes heads bellow from mens shoulders dogs walk on their hind legs in the midst of all this a mask is lifted and as in Callots Temptation of St	647.3725666040741
Anthony a lovely face is exhibited which we would fain follow but from which we are separated by troops of fiends	460.1271853926271
This will give a faint idea of the Carnival at Rome	68.93011617115829
At the second turn the count stopped the carriage and requested permission to withdraw leaving the vehicle at their disposal	137.85697483309752
Franz looked upthey were opposite the Rospoli Palace	1360.9169928959104
At the centre window the one hung with white damask with a red cross was a blue domino beneath which Franzs imagination easily pictured the beautiful Greek of the Argentina	227.5741143361488
Gentlemen said the count springing out when you are tired of being actors and wish to become spectators of this scene you know you have places at my windows	115.29517616589753
In the meantime dispose of my coachman my carriage and my servants	131.98837212816082
We have forgotten to mention that the counts coachman was attired in a bearskin exactly resembling Odrys in The Bear and the Pasha and the two footmen behind were dressed up as green monkeys with spring masks with which they made grimaces at everyone who passed	433.60694474960576
Franz thanked the count for his attention	33.99486870615122
As for Albert he was busily occupied throwing bouquets at a carriage full of Roman peasants that was passing near him	325.72581799376326
Unfortunately for him the line of carriages moved on again and while he descended the Piazza del Popolo the other ascended towards the Palazzo di Venezia	146.09726572333864
Ah my dear fellow said he to Franz you did not see	51.54335690535594
Therethat calash filled with Roman peasants	568.0415441694927
Well I am convinced they are all charming women	250.15733191981488
How unfortunate that you were masked Albert said Franz here was an opportunity of making up for past disappointments	368.28171492230143
Oh replied he half laughing half serious I hope the Carnival will not pass without some amends in one shape or the other	197.15211496304204
But in spite of Alberts hope the day passed unmarked by any incident excepting two or three encounters with the carriage full of Roman peasants	341.4880561296559
At one of these encounters accidentally or purposely Alberts mask fell off	5253.832707557016
He instantly rose and cast the remainder of the bouquets into the carriage	112.0972681730322
Doubtless one of the charming females Albert had detected beneath their coquettish disguise was touched by his gallantry for as the carriage of the two friends passed her she threw a bunch of violets	215.10661642986395
Albert seized it and as Franz had no reason to suppose it was meant for him he suffered Albert to retain it	100.27078530795679
Albert placed it in his buttonhole and the carriage went triumphantly on	283.4873917369745
Well said Franz to him there is the beginning of an adventure	55.746222512493546
Laugh if you pleaseI really think so	231.10563686742228
So I will not abandon this bouquet	1548.1468947690328
Pardieu returned Franz laughing in token of your ingratitude	350.9000860396678
The jest however soon appeared to become earnest for when Albert and Franz again encountered the carriage with the contadini the one who had thrown the violets to Albert clapped her hands when she beheld them in his buttonhole	149.66835405873084
Bravo bravo said Franz things go wonderfully	8714.166109441294
Shall I leave you Perhaps you would prefer being alone	371.9472349632552
No replied he I will not be caught like a fool at a first disclosure by a rendezvous under the clock as they say at the operaballs	165.22641643447946
If the fair peasant wishes to carry matters any further we shall find her or rather she will find us tomorrow then she will give me some sign or other and I shall know what I have to do	58.48193299755903
On my word said Franz you are as wise as Nestor and prudent as Ulysses and your fair Circe must be very skilful or very powerful if she succeed in changing you into a beast of any kind	238.33564288876255
Albert was right the fair unknown had resolved doubtless to carry the intrigue no farther for although the young men made several more turns they did not again see the calash which had turned up one of the neighboring streets	218.67963003767568
Then they returned to the Rospoli Palace but the count and the blue domino had also disappeared the two windows hung with yellow damask were still occupied by the persons whom the count had invited	92.99402862614508
At this moment the same bell that had proclaimed the beginning of the mascherata sounded the retreat	266.6271583796274
The file on the Corso broke the line and in a second all the carriages had disappeared	92.0788206923083
Franz and Albert were opposite the Via delle Muratte the coachman without saying a word drove up it passed along the Piazza di Spagna and the Rospoli Palace and stopped at the door of the hotel	95.08837695934452
Signor Pastrini came to the door to receive his guests	39.94206575026866
Franz hastened to inquire after the count and to express regret that he had not returned in sufficient time but Pastrini reassured him by saying that the Count of Monte Cristo had ordered a second carriage for himself and that it had gone at four oclock to fetch him from the Rospoli Palace	84.39559053531575
The count had moreover charged him to offer the two friends the key of his box at the Argentina	44.76941566676059
Franz questioned Albert as to his intentions but Albert had great projects to put into execution before going to the theatre and instead of making any answer he inquired if Signor Pastrini could procure him a tailor	165.87014203509924
A tailor said the host and for what	83.744436648621
To make us between now and tomorrow two Roman peasant costumes returned Albert	458.2494379879002
To make you two costumes between now and tomorrow I ask your excellencies pardon but this is quite a French demand for the next week you will not find a single tailor who would consent to sew six buttons on a waistcoat if you paid him a crown a piece for each button	170.92794175906192
Then I must give up the idea	58.695210543932916
Leave all to me and tomorrow when you awake you shall find a collection of costumes with which you will be satisfied	86.01357912671033
My dear Albert said Franz leave all to our host he has already proved himself full of resources let us dine quietly and afterwards go and see lItalienne   Alger	346.9595115392974
Agreed returned Albert but remember Signor Pastrini that both my friend and myself attach the greatest importance to having tomorrow the costumes we have asked for	286.3287282264479
The host again assured them they might rely on him and that their wishes should be attended to upon which Franz and Albert mounted to their apartments and proceeded to disencumber themselves of their costumes	184.74897484817996
Albert as he took off his dress carefully preserved the bunch of violets it was his token reserved for the morrow	202.31871891115324
The two friends sat down to table but they could not refrain from remarking the difference between the Count of Monte Cristos table and that of Signor Pastrini	75.46892058813107
Truth compelled Franz in spite of the dislike he seemed to have taken to the count to confess that the advantage was not on Pastrinis side	84.06731629847926
During dessert the servant inquired at what time they wished for the carriage	85.65737957958551
Albert and Franz looked at each other fearing really to abuse the counts kindness	357.02961704489627
His excellency the Count of Monte Cristo had he said given positive orders that the carriage was to remain at their lordships orders all day and they could therefore dispose of it without fear of indiscretion	168.7484782284072
They resolved to profit by the counts courtesy and ordered the horses to be harnessed while they substituted evening dress for that which they had on and which was somewhat the worse for the numerous combats they had sustained	254.03434596569895
This precaution taken they went to the theatre and installed themselves in the counts box	68.1279490799956
During the first act the Countess G entered	1182.9055864643344
Her first look was at the box where she had seen the count the previous evening so that she perceived Franz and Albert in the place of the very person concerning whom she had expressed so strange an opinion to Franz	84.51460389746649
Her operaglass was so fixedly directed towards them that Franz saw it would be cruel not to satisfy her curiosity and availing himself of one of the privileges of the spectators of the Italian theatres who use their boxes to hold receptions the two friends went to pay their respects to the countess	108.84866510208545
Scarcely had they entered when she motioned to Franz to assume the seat of honor	150.57788695415266
Albert in his turn sat behind	289.6223031110051
Well said she hardly giving Franz time to sit down it seems you have nothing better to do than to make the acquaintance of this new Lord Ruthven and you are already the best friends in the world	65.97051824489284
Without being so far advanced as that my dear countess returned Franz I can not deny that we have abused his good nature all day	126.8188548408382
Yes this morning we breakfasted with him we rode in his carriage all day and now we have taken possession of his box	74.49625682087924
It would frighten you too much	9.022812977389341
At least wait until the story has a conclusion	578.0306466940694
Very well I prefer complete histories but tell me how you made his acquaintance Did anyone introduce you to him	202.16510508274726
No it was he who introduced himself to us	51.984355333863604
Last night after we left you	44.33842838629937
The very prosaic one of our landlord	488.05391084902726
He is staying then at the Htel de Londres with you	24.69564210896236
Not only in the same hotel but on the same floor	18.029186792707968
What is his name for of course you know	260.7547717452763
That is not a family name	36.53728911811671
No it is the name of the island he has purchased	60.51675230247012
Well we must put up with that said the countess who was herself from one of the oldest Venetian families	79.11725476314052
What sort of a man is he	97.09457476687813
de Morcerf I am referred to you said the countess	15.568825140897344
We should be very hard to please madam returned Albert did we not think him delightful	287.57848850117927
A friend of ten years standing could not have done more for us or with a more perfect courtesy	114.63754689660715
Come observed the countess smiling I see my vampire is only some millionaire who has taken the appearance of Lara in order to avoid being confounded with M	135.50617646970383
de Rothschild and you have seen her	35.31108103527591
No we heard I think the sound of her guzla but she remained perfectly invisible	219.388944544235
When you say invisible interrupted Albert it is only to keep up the mystery for whom do you take the blue domino at the window with the white curtains	63.89691233708622
Where was this window with white hangings asked the countess	135.90704397082493
The count had three windows at the Rospoli Palace	282.93921353611216
Did you pass through the Corso	21539.443304633332
Well did you notice two windows hung with yellow damask and one with white damask with a red cross Those were the counts windows	84.50338153605146
Why he must be a nabob	4278.952633170395
Do you know what those three windows were worth	579.4082821167091
Two or three hundred Roman crowns	115.57392339383632
Does his island produce him such a revenue	394.11530650260147
It does not bring him a bajocco	1413.6817375878466
Then why did he purchase it	14.671014534778768
In reality observed Albert he seemed to me somewhat eccentric were he at Paris and a frequenter of the theatres I should say he was a poor devil literally mad	277.2523368334017
This morning he made two or three exits worthy of Didier or Anthony	1248.7427921067533
At this moment a fresh visitor entered and according to custom Franz gave up his seat to him	176.8799056681136
This circumstance had moreover the effect of changing the conversation an hour afterwards the two friends returned to their hotel	70.60736557840222
Signor Pastrini had already set about procuring their disguises for the morrow and he assured them that they would be perfectly satisfied	210.05628658229148
The next morning at nine oclock he entered Franzs room followed by a tailor who had eight or ten Roman peasant costumes on his arm they selected two exactly alike and charged the tailor to sew on each of their hats about twenty yards of ribbon and to procure them two of the long silk sashes of different colors with which the lower orders decorate themselves on fte days	274.70102662123855
Albert was impatient to see how he looked in his new dressa jacket and breeches of blue velvet silk stockings with clocks shoes with buckles and a silk waistcoat	212.2779280620977
This picturesque attire set him off to great advantage and when he had bound the scarf around his waist and when his hat placed coquettishly on one side let fall on his shoulder a stream of ribbons Franz was forced to confess that costume has much to do with the physical superiority we accord to certain nations	207.25121522262154
The Turks used to be so picturesque with their long and flowing robes but are they not now hideous with their blue frocks buttoned up to the chin and their red caps which make them look like a bottle of wine with a red seal Franz complimented Albert who looked at himself in the glass with an unequivocal smile of satisfaction	170.13214965457723
They were thus engaged when the Count of Monte Cristo entered	8.245191434566223
Gentlemen said he although a companion is agreeable perfect freedom is sometimes still more agreeable	792.8792070738396
I come to say that today and for the remainder of the Carnival I leave the carriage entirely at your disposal	130.36237564170455
The host will tell you I have three or four more so that you will not inconvenience me in any way	44.72927194126074
Make use of it I pray you for your pleasure or your business	65.61118333425405
The young men wished to decline but they could find no good reason for refusing an offer which was so agreeable to them	189.71299287536513
The Count of Monte Cristo remained a quarter of an hour with them conversing on all subjects with the greatest ease	76.20620594259131
He was as we have already said perfectly well acquainted with the literature of all countries	108.74775092982607
A glance at the walls of his salon proved to Franz and Albert that he was a connoisseur of pictures	87.13226865219768
A few words he let fall showed them that he was no stranger to the sciences and he seemed much occupied with chemistry	168.88289148363577
The two friends did not venture to return the count the breakfast he had given them it would have been too absurd to offer him in exchange for his excellent table the very inferior one of Signor Pastrini	94.93432806515129
They told him so frankly and he received their excuses with the air of a man who appreciated their delicacy	108.0585301464006
Albert was charmed with the counts manners and he was only prevented from recognizing him for a perfect gentleman by reason of his varied knowledge	236.18327323713365
The permission to do what he liked with the carriage pleased him above all for the fair peasants had appeared in a most elegant carriage the preceding evening and Albert was not sorry to be upon an equal footing with them	202.5917271476185
At halfpast one they descended the coachman and footman had put on their livery over their disguises which gave them a more ridiculous appearance than ever and which gained them the applause of Franz and Albert	151.72693090905636
Albert had fastened the faded bunch of violets to his buttonhole	208.22963074411803
At the first sound of the bell they hastened into the Corso by the Via Vittoria	141.8219251591104
At the second turn a bunch of fresh violets thrown from a carriage filled with harlequins indicated to Albert that like himself and his friend the peasants had changed their costume also and whether it was the result of chance or whether a similar feeling had possessed them both while he had donned their costume they had assumed his	190.12052205478838
Albert placed the fresh bouquet in his buttonhole but he kept the faded one in his hand and when he again met the calash he raised it to his lips an action which seemed greatly to amuse not only the fair lady who had thrown it but her joyous companions also	124.02139320617083
The day was as gay as the preceding one perhaps even more animated and noisy the count appeared for an instant at his window but when they again passed he had disappeared	100.30750484005245
It is almost needless to say that the flirtation between Albert and the fair peasant continued all day	338.44951315849954
In the evening on his return Franz found a letter from the embassy informing him that he would have the honor of being received by his holiness the next day	57.24294874089933
At each previous visit he had made to Rome he had solicited and obtained the same favor and incited as much by a religious feeling as by gratitude he was unwilling to quit the capital of the Christian world without laying his respectful homage at the feet of one of St	148.8173680554698
Peters successors who has set the rare example of all the virtues	84.65984132488029
He did not then think of the Carnival for in spite of his condescension and touching kindness one can not incline ones self without awe before the venerable and noble old man called Gregory XVI	418.03336073855286
On his return from the Vatican Franz carefully avoided the Corso he brought away with him a treasure of pious thoughts to which the mad gayety of the maskers would have been profanation	439.4143430062344
At ten minutes past five Albert entered overjoyed	4820.157544982842
The harlequin had reassumed her peasants costume and as she passed she raised her mask	164.519377073631
Franz congratulated Albert who received his congratulations with the air of a man conscious that they are merited	53.856665021334486
He had recognized by certain unmistakable signs that his fair incognita belonged to the aristocracy	765.5319445604193
He had made up his mind to write to her the next day	41.05074505163823
Franz remarked while he gave these details that Albert seemed to have something to ask of him but that he was unwilling to ask it	54.819441466536354
He insisted upon it declaring beforehand that he was willing to make any sacrifice the other wished	105.26820858071525
Albert let himself be pressed just as long as friendship required and then avowed to Franz that he would do him a great favor by allowing him to occupy the carriage alone the next day	111.56213468475487
Albert attributed to Franzs absence the extreme kindness of the fair peasant in raising her mask	225.0554632372255
Franz was not sufficiently egotistical to stop Albert in the middle of an adventure that promised to prove so agreeable to his curiosity and so flattering to his vanity	115.66943377789632
He felt assured that the perfect indiscretion of his friend would duly inform him of all that happened and as during three years that he had travelled all over Italy a similar piece of good fortune had never fallen to his share Franz was by no means sorry to learn how to act on such an occasion	137.86730950931388
He therefore promised Albert that he would content himself the morrow with witnessing the Carnival from the windows of the Rospoli Palace	237.56631796073455
The next morning he saw Albert pass and repass holding an enormous bouquet which he doubtless meant to make the bearer of his amorous epistle	273.8725825445586
This belief was changed into certainty when Franz saw the bouquet conspicuous by a circle of white camellias in the hand of a charming harlequin dressed in rosecolored satin	223.21483789423993
The evening was no longer joy but delirium	1090.1781890880839
Albert nothing doubted but that the fair unknown would reply in the same manner	83.13760275368811
Franz anticipated his wishes by saying that the noise fatigued him and that he should pass the next day in writing and looking over his journal	92.20403015612466
Albert was not deceived for the next evening Franz saw him enter triumphantly shaking a folded paper which he held by one corner	183.37312224273447
Well said he was I mistaken	3641.2690766628675
She has answered you cried Franz	964.8052887637707
This word was pronounced in a manner impossible to describe	68.57650946365925
Franz took the letter and read	23.58238534332383
Tuesday evening at seven oclock descend from your carriage opposite the Via dei Pontefici and follow the Roman peasant who snatches your torch from you	311.75507286390825
When you arrive at the first step of the church of San Giacomo be sure to fasten a knot of rosecolored ribbons to the shoulder of your harlequin costume in order that you may be recognized	202.93884569637987
Until then you will not see me	23.452499629173946
Well asked he when Franz had finished what do you think of that	21.20082311902241
I think that the adventure is assuming a very agreeable appearance	224.6824764725995
I think so also replied Albert and I very much fear you will go alone to the Duke of Braccianos ball	106.99041903990317
Franz and Albert had received that morning an invitation from the celebrated Roman banker	379.91597953031476
All the nobility of Rome will be present and if your fair incognita belong to the higher class of society she must go there	205.39844569929357
Whether she goes there or not my opinion is still the same returned Albert	130.7777737894336
You know how imperfectly the women of the mezzo cito are educated in Italy This is the name of the lower class	170.71834896732219
Look at the writing and find if you can any blemish in the language or orthography	317.19217442197703
The writing was in reality charming and the orthography irreproachable	2124.5928612419516
You are born to good fortune said Franz as he returned the letter	64.76787156892838
Laugh as much as you will replied Albert I am in love	72.83596172557664
I see that I shall not only go alone to the Duke of Braccianos but also return to Florence alone	119.66329015585707
If my unknown be as amiable as she is beautiful said Albert I shall fix myself at Rome for six weeks at least	85.40532402293378
I adore Rome and I have always had a great taste for archology	166.55009587844233
Come two or three more such adventures and I do not despair of seeing you a member of the Academy	99.0799388191372
Doubtless Albert was about to discuss seriously his right to the academic chair when they were informed that dinner was ready	287.9918904066507
Alberts love had not taken away his appetite	484.7859993623848
He hastened with Franz to seat himself free to recommence the discussion after dinner	287.91794120395366
After dinner the Count of Monte Cristo was announced	10.49903940485217
They had not seen him for two days	22.83848509654028
Signor Pastrini informed them that business had called him to Civita Vecchia	411.2727805484346
He had started the previous evening and had only returned an hour since	78.43136594734361
Whether he kept a watch over himself or whether by accident he did not sound the acrimonious chords that in other circumstances had been touched he was tonight like everybody else	223.87277718805038
The man was an enigma to Franz	189.52501514315972
The count must feel sure that Franz recognized him and yet he had not let fall a single word indicating any previous acquaintance between them	160.32390017792008
On his side however great Franzs desire was to allude to their former interview the fear of being disagreeable to the man who had loaded him and his friend with kindness prevented him from mentioning it	162.7342432616597
The count had learned that the two friends had sent to secure a box at the Argentina Theatre and were told they were all let	131.41320963322062
In consequence he brought them the key of his ownat least such was the apparent motive of his visit	188.34350932109803
Franz and Albert made some difficulty alleging their fear of depriving him of it but the count replied that as he was going to the Palli Theatre the box at the Argentina Theatre would be lost if they did not profit by it	143.85935928237615
This assurance determined the two friends to accept it	98.38590247502398
Franz had by degrees become accustomed to the counts pallor which had so forcibly struck him at their first meeting	98.34416368713467
He could not refrain from admiring the severe beauty of his features the only defect or rather the principal quality of which was the pallor	179.98735633842904
Truly a Byronic hero Franz could not we will not say see him but even think of him without imagining his stern head upon Manfreds shoulders or beneath Laras helmet	353.7911290109368
His forehead was marked with the line that indicates the constant presence of bitter thoughts he had the fiery eyes that seem to penetrate to the very soul and the haughty and disdainful upper lip that gives to the words it utters a peculiar character that impresses them on the minds of those to whom they are addressed	190.06566704396573
The count was no longer young	6326.355210805111
He was at least forty and yet it was easy to understand that he was formed to rule the young men with whom he associated at present	57.46264937821019
And to complete his resemblance with the fantastic heroes of the English poet the count seemed to have the power of fascination	86.1571648950033
Albert was constantly expatiating on their good fortune in meeting such a man	97.12947548873841
Franz was less enthusiastic but the count exercised over him also the ascendency a strong mind always acquires over a mind less domineering	545.6964140273924
He thought several times of the project the count had of visiting Paris and he had no doubt but that with his eccentric character his characteristic face and his colossal fortune he would produce a great effect there	152.58153450557913
And yet he did not wish to be at Paris when the count was there	33.73271954407606
The evening passed as evenings mostly pass at Italian theatres that is not in listening to the music but in paying visits and conversing	572.3632666010295
The Countess G wished to revive the subject of the count but Franz announced he had something far newer to tell her and in spite of Alberts demonstrations of false modesty he informed the countess of the great event which had preoccupied them for the last three days	131.42571613693872
As similar intrigues are not uncommon in Italy if we may credit travellers the comtess did not manifest the least incredulity but congratulated Albert on his success	510.2525191269189
They promised upon separating to meet at the Duke of Braccianos ball to which all Rome was invited	249.7115668043861
The heroine of the bouquet kept her word she gave Albert no sign of her existence the morrow or the day after	187.16489538725662
At length Tuesday came the last and most tumultuous day of the Carnival	168.12141887645575
On Tuesday the theatres open at ten oclock in the morning as Lent begins after eight at night	97.64240795265695
On Tuesday all those who through want of money time or enthusiasm have not been to see the Carnival before mingle in the gayety and contribute to the noise and excitement	280.32577678940635
From two oclock till five Franz and Albert followed in the fte exchanging handfuls of confetti with the other carriages and the pedestrians who crowded amongst the horses feet and the carriage wheels without a single accident a single dispute or a single fight	302.823316970206
The ftes are veritable pleasure days to the Italians	646.9791058792161
The author of this history who has resided five or six years in Italy does not recollect to have ever seen a ceremony interrupted by one of those events so common in other countries	120.90388556195911
Albert was triumphant in his harlequin costume	3296.4532224318837
A knot of rosecolored ribbons fell from his shoulder almost to the ground	33.39115471077614
In order that there might be no confusion Franz wore his peasants costume	427.89324115674754
As the day advanced the tumult became greater	1244.036277352779
There was not on the pavement in the carriages at the windows a single tongue that was silent a single arm that did not move	134.7652460771996
It was a human storm made up of a thunder of cries and a hail of sweetmeats flowers eggs oranges and nosegays	300.0458702236079
At three oclock the sound of fireworks let off on the Piazza del Popolo and the Piazza di Venezia heard with difficulty amid the din and confusion announced that the races were about to begin	118.59426516826895
The races like the moccoli are one of the episodes peculiar to the last days of the Carnival	103.3315172190624
At the sound of the fireworks the carriages instantly broke ranks and retired by the adjacent streets	812.8647262431693
All these evolutions are executed with an inconceivable address and marvellous rapidity without the police interfering in the matter	358.84278136729955
The pedestrians ranged themselves against the walls then the trampling of horses and the clashing of steel were heard	142.4215218249685
A detachment of carbineers fifteen abreast galloped up the Corso in order to clear it for the barberi	372.61264257806135
When the detachment arrived at the Piazza di Venezia a second volley of fireworks was discharged to announce that the street was clear	218.69865609223828
Almost instantly in the midst of a tremendous and general outcry seven or eight horses excited by the shouts of three hundred thousand spectators passed by like lightning	257.72408050249516
Then the Castle of Saint Angelo fired three cannon to indicate that number three had won	1115.390565617431
Immediately without any other signal the carriages moved on flowing on towards the Corso down all the streets like torrents pent up for a while which again flow into the parent river and the immense stream again continued its course between its two granite banks	496.19967508098784
A new source of noise and movement was added to the crowd	82.039884928411
The sellers of moccoletti entered on the scene	29.04505382532129
The moccoli or moccoletti are candles which vary in size from the pascal taper to the rushlight and which give to each actor in the great final scene of the Carnival two very serious problems to grapple withfirst how to keep his own moccoletto alight and secondly how to extinguish the moccoletti of others	651.8995758808692
The moccoletto is like life man has found but one means of transmitting it and that one comes from God	216.10545964959886
But he has discovered a thousand means of taking it away and the devil has somewhat aided him	198.2948509627991
The moccoletto is kindled by approaching it to a light	284.35280011559666
But who can describe the thousand means of extinguishing the moccolettothe gigantic bellows the monstrous extinguishers the superhuman fans	3286.8911509325744
Everyone hastened to purchase moccolettiFranz and Albert among the rest	124.95994549268636
The night was rapidly approaching and already at the cry of Moccoletti repeated by the shrill voices of a thousand vendors two or three stars began to burn among the crowd	197.33822713691308
At the end of ten minutes fifty thousand lights glittered descending from the Palazzo di Venezia to the Piazza del Popolo and mounting from the Piazza del Popolo to the Palazzo di Venezia	131.3169800914924
It seemed like the fte of Jackolanterns	1011.0824317514373
It is impossible to form any idea of it without having seen it	115.29850604634656
Suppose that all the stars had descended from the sky and mingled in a wild dance on the face of the earth the whole accompanied by cries that were never heard in any other part of the world	69.62180950978261
The facchino follows the prince the Transteverin the citizen everyone blowing extinguishing relighting	14700.895168442365
Had old olus appeared at this moment he would have been proclaimed king of the moccoli and Aquilo the heirpresumptive to the throne	178.34057909294384
This battle of folly and flame continued for two hours the Corso was light as day the features of the spectators on the third and fourth stories were visible	209.84908639426868
Every five minutes Albert took out his watch at length it pointed to seven	81.56345075343484
The two friends were in the Via dei Pontefici	1283.199048662834
Albert sprang out bearing his moccoletto in his hand	110.26628402492831
Two or three masks strove to knock his moccoletto out of his hand but Albert a firstrate pugilist sent them rolling in the street one after the other and continued his course towards the church of San Giacomo	211.4530308546845
The steps were crowded with masks who strove to snatch each others torches	581.8506926780987
Franz followed Albert with his eyes and saw him mount the first step	40.411710732306695
Instantly a mask wearing the wellknown costume of a peasant woman snatched his moccoletto from him without his offering any resistance	305.7192402029436
Franz was too far off to hear what they said but without doubt nothing hostile passed for he saw Albert disappear arminarm with the peasant girl	291.09300385832114
He watched them pass through the crowd for some time but at length he lost sight of them in the Via Macello	49.428288486841666
Suddenly the bell that gives the signal for the end of the Carnival sounded and at the same instant all the moccoletti were extinguished as if by enchantment	104.25543326269167
It seemed as though one immense blast of the wind had extinguished everyone	942.4888403049068
Franz found himself in utter darkness	60.656367006365834
No sound was audible save that of the carriages that were carrying the maskers home nothing was visible save a few lights that burnt behind the windows	308.6787858147173
In his whole life perhaps Franz had never before experienced so sudden an impression so rapid a transition from gayety to sadness as in this moment	287.46225867292964
It seemed as though Rome under the magic breath of some demon of the night had suddenly changed into a vast tomb	160.2300744245847
By a chance which added yet more to the intensity of the darkness the moon which was on the wane did not rise until eleven oclock and the streets which the young man traversed were plunged in the deepest obscurity	116.31458640880206
The distance was short and at the end of ten minutes his carriage or rather the counts stopped before the Htel de Londres	40.08656200648363
Dinner was waiting but as Albert had told him that he should not return so soon Franz sat down without him	62.777176774246655
Signor Pastrini who had been accustomed to see them dine together inquired into the cause of his absence but Franz merely replied that Albert had received on the previous evening an invitation which he had accepted	111.4388331737411
The sudden extinction of the moccoletti the darkness which had replaced the light and the silence which had succeeded the turmoil had left in Franzs mind a certain depression which was not free from uneasiness	192.77415470021955
He therefore dined very silently in spite of the officious attention of his host who presented himself two or three times to inquire if he wanted anything	64.86854654446157
Franz resolved to wait for Albert as late as possible	126.75293186308375
He ordered the carriage therefore for eleven oclock desiring Signor Pastrini to inform him the moment that Albert returned to the hotel	139.7545825168607
At eleven oclock Albert had not come back	63.63722765265961
Franz dressed himself and went out telling his host that he was going to pass the night at the Duke of Braccianos	53.72295475731204
The house of the Duke of Bracciano is one of the most delightful in Rome the duchess one of the last heiresses of the Colonnas does its honors with the most consummate grace and thus their ftes have a European celebrity	256.41356881614104
Franz and Albert had brought to Rome letters of introduction to them and their first question on his arrival was to inquire the whereabouts of his travelling companion	164.8301883048857
Franz replied that he had left him at the moment they were about to extinguish the moccoli and that he had lost sight of him in the Via Macello	56.872919230651014
Then he has not returned said the duke	110.5774799214999
I waited for him until this hour replied Franz	249.3645524046585
And do you know whither he went	78.02620226925835
No not precisely however I think it was something very like a rendezvous	102.08456449329844
Diavolo said the duke this is a bad day or rather a bad night to be out late is it not countess	107.11877068876974
These words were addressed to the Countess G who had just arrived and was leaning on the arm of Signor Torlonia the dukes brother	78.01475149706994
I think on the contrary that it is a charming night replied the countess and those who are here will complain of but one thing that of its too rapid flight	113.20692113099257
I am not speaking said the duke with a smile of the persons who are here the men run no other danger than that of falling in love with you and the women of falling ill of jealousy at seeing you so lovely I meant persons who were out in the streets of Rome	91.1417227275073
Ah asked the countess who is out in the streets of Rome at this hour unless it be to go to a ball	103.57650646307768
Our friend Albert de Morcerf countess whom I left in pursuit of his unknown about seven oclock this evening said Franz and whom I have not seen since	104.57663371430917
And do nt you know where he is	27.68002342196976
You should not have allowed him to go said the duke to Franz you who know Rome better than he does	87.3235562609986
You might as well have tried to stop number three of the barberi who gained the prize in the race today replied Franz and then moreover what could happen to him	182.98509433175613
Who can tell The night is gloomy and the Tiber is very near the Via Macello	269.56105945195867
Franz felt a shudder run through his veins at observing that the feeling of the duke and the countess was so much in unison with his own personal disquietude	112.53129718834015
I informed them at the hotel that I had the honor of passing the night here duke said Franz and desired them to come and inform me of his return	90.5513640913748
Ah replied the duke here I think is one of my servants who is seeking you	35.89097338694301
The duke was not mistaken when he saw Franz the servant came up to him	86.35078165242292
Your excellency he said the master of the Htel de Londres has sent to let you know that a man is waiting for you with a letter from the Viscount of Morcerf	39.701856602881975
A letter from the viscount exclaimed Franz	190.81291030389764
Why did he not bring it to me here	18.96418572793275
He went away directly he saw me enter the ballroom to find you	101.73122501611813
Oh said the countess to Franz go with all speedpoor young man Perhaps some accident has happened to him	237.4743395530486
Shall we see you again to give us any information inquired the countess	93.82388781918617
Yes if it is not any serious affair otherwise I can not answer as to what I may do myself	79.82179951678935
Be prudent in any event said the countess	10.939645476925556
Oh pray be assured of that	48.835536360372124
Franz took his hat and went away in haste	49.6244007157627
He had sent away his carriage with orders for it to fetch him at two oclock fortunately the Palazzo Bracciano which is on one side in the Corso and on the other in the Square of the Holy Apostles is hardly ten minutes walk from the Htel de Londres	103.16733042842831
As he came near the hotel Franz saw a man in the middle of the street	34.95970097450383
He had no doubt that it was the messenger from Albert	113.95693470961811
The man was wrapped up in a large cloak	24.970853953907113
He went up to him but to his extreme astonishment the stranger first addressed him	170.05216237247208
What wants your excellency of me inquired the man retreating a step or two as if to keep on his guard	118.78175243983424
Are not you the person who brought me a letter inquired Franz from the Viscount of Morcerf	77.12757483509914
Your excellency lodges at Pastrinis hotel	2776.362520314116
Your excellency is the travelling companion of the viscount	76.84697657418351
Then it is to your excellency that this letter is addressed	52.41907213583406
Is there any answer inquired Franz taking the letter from him	45.84955366114066
Yesyour friend at least hopes so	101.73255448084142
Come upstairs with me and I will give it to you	12.68876159399193
I prefer waiting here said the messenger with a smile	19.431614440328296
Your excellency will know when you have read the letter	26.73767100576644
Shall I find you here then	169.526610836507
On the staircase he met Signor Pastrini	2160.39008814106
You have seen the man who desired to speak with you from your friend he asked of Franz	39.04883676667897
Yes I have seen him he replied and he has handed this letter to me	63.820393299623866
Light the candles in my apartment if you please	29.67745198041889
The innkeeper gave orders to a servant to go before Franz with a light	99.60728821149027
The young man had found Signor Pastrini looking very much alarmed and this had only made him the more anxious to read Alberts letter and so he went instantly towards the waxlight and unfolded it	214.00275660923674
It was written and signed by Albert	94.2212475313967
Franz read it twice before he could comprehend what it contained	114.77835164022267
The moment you have received this have the kindness to take the letter of credit from my pocketbook which you will find in the square drawer of the secrtaire add your own to it if it be not sufficient	110.30834949671899
Run to Torlonia draw from him instantly four thousand piastres and give them to the bearer	96.04909491595888
It is urgent that I should have this money without delay	92.29169141807719
I do not say more relying on you as you may rely on me	39.79105384399976
I now believe in Italian banditti	38890.90810913995
Below these lines were written in a strange hand the following in Italian	85.99673875612024
Se alle sei della mattina le quattro mille piastre non sono nelle mie mani alla sette il Conte Alberto avr cessato di vivere	1450.7931349664466
If by six in the morning the four thousand piastres are not in my hands by seven oclock the Count Albert will have ceased to live	88.25195952396265
This second signature explained everything to Franz who now understood the objection of the messenger to coming up into the apartment the street was safer for him	100.3876422936525
Albert then had fallen into the hands of the famous bandit chief in whose existence he had for so long a time refused to believe	96.72134409927635
There was no time to lose	15.901928505742488
He hastened to open the secrtaire and found the pocketbook in the drawer and in it the letter of credit	113.18932214935163
There were in all six thousand piastres but of these six thousand Albert had already expended three thousand	228.65485271805468
As to Franz he had no letter of credit as he lived at Florence and had only come to Rome to pass seven or eight days he had brought but a hundred louis and of these he had not more than fifty left	110.49978962268825
Thus seven or eight hundred piastres were wanting to them both to make up the sum that Albert required	131.10310473589644
True he might in such a case rely on the kindness of Signor Torlonia	160.13299874794544
He was therefore about to return to the Palazzo Bracciano without loss of time when suddenly a luminous idea crossed his mind	275.8082661611904
He remembered the Count of Monte Cristo	1.0744305501420246
Franz was about to ring for Signor Pastrini when that worthy presented himself	491.3287493428157
My dear sir he said hastily do you know if the count is within	46.54508772634864
Yes your excellency he has this moment returned	521.9535978098108
Then ring at his door if you please and request him to be so kind as to give me an audience	39.82351572678988
Signor Pastrini did as he was desired and returning five minutes after he said	82.73662705651128
Franz went along the corridor and a servant introduced him to the count	44.117300280909355
He was in a small room which Franz had not yet seen and which was surrounded with divans	67.10626126799134
Well what good wind blows you hither at this hour said he have you come to sup with me It would be very kind of you	62.7055352756535
No I have come to speak to you of a very serious matter	43.400460556784694
A serious matter said the count looking at Franz with the earnestness usual to him and what may it be	77.99052356299586
Yes replied the count going to the door and returning	40.13180322783586
Se alle sei della mattina le quattro mille piastre non sono nelle mie mani alla sette il conte Alberto avr cessato di vivere	1406.1908769431197
What think you of that inquired Franz	943.6767286015618
Have you the money he demands	24200.662418218926
Yes all but eight hundred piastres	1023.9829298021928
The count went to his secrtaire opened it and pulling out a drawer filled with gold said to Franz I hope you will not offend me by applying to anyone but myself	135.53879551143388
You see on the contrary I come to you first and instantly replied Franz	202.21381254723033
And I thank you have what you will and he made a sign to Franz to take what he pleased	64.61169450469639
Is it absolutely necessary then to send the money to Luigi Vampa asked the young man looking fixedly in his turn at the count	48.96122116128275
I think that if you would take the trouble of reflecting you could find a way of simplifying the negotiation said Franz	154.84208174427465
How so returned the count with surprise	90.1729925844
If we were to go together to Luigi Vampa I am sure he would not refuse you Alberts freedom	177.74061825520894
What influence can I possibly have over a bandit	225.4518645425429
Have you not just rendered him a service that can never be forgotten	80.979292227693
Have you not saved Peppinos life	140.5756064364295
Well well said the count who told you that	25.853716703722498
The count knit his brows and remained silent an instant	62.81679374654578
And if I went to seek Vampa would you accompany me	262.9175193130977
If my society would not be disagreeable	56.413192573587196
It is a lovely night and a walk without Rome will do us both good	195.28315616851944
Where is the man who brought the letter	83.58000999469789
I must learn where we are going	17.50848604739827
It is useless he would not come up	73.40011176272925
To your apartments perhaps but he will not make any difficulty at entering mine	85.8910046307479
The count went to the window of the apartment that looked on to the street and whistled in a peculiar manner	81.29379344799256
The man in the mantle quitted the wall and advanced into the middle of the street	33.32924753033954
Salite said the count in the same tone in which he would have given an order to his servant	17.92192951182925
The messenger obeyed without the least hesitation but rather with alacrity and mounting the steps at a bound entered the hotel five seconds afterwards he was at the door of the room	91.11727301466145
Ah it is you Peppino said the count	4.153267273479197
But Peppino instead of answering threw himself on his knees seized the counts hand and covered it with kisses	58.9169147806823
Ah said the count you have then not forgotten that I saved your life that is strange for it is a week ago	76.52598208524518
No excellency and never shall I forget it returned Peppino with an accent of profound gratitude	49.466925647187665
Never That is a long time but it is something that you believe so	35.28880462355208
Oh you may speak before his excellency said he he is one of my friends	51.44633456067023
You allow me to give you this title continued the count in French it is necessary to excite this mans confidence	74.49595312191158
You can speak before me said Franz I am a friend of the counts	41.85930984879442
I am ready to answer any questions your excellency may address to me	116.23964641381036
How did the Viscount Albert fall into Luigis hands	701.162714533758
Excellency the Frenchmans carriage passed several times the one in which was Teresa	212.45641105376697
The Frenchman threw her a bouquet Teresa returned itall this with the consent of the chief who was in the carriage	166.13028009132523
What cried Franz was Luigi Vampa in the carriage with the Roman peasants	56.33972385185133
It was he who drove disguised as the coachman replied Peppino	938.1350595319017
Well then the Frenchman took off his mask Teresa with the chiefs consent did the same	171.1636847929016
The Frenchman asked for a rendezvous Teresa gave him oneonly instead of Teresa it was Beppo who was on the steps of the church of San Giacomo	197.6121513821765
What exclaimed Franz the peasant girl who snatched his mocoletto from him	91.56372498299757
Was a lad of fifteen replied Peppino	5882.020191743435
But it was no disgrace to your friend to have been deceived Beppo has taken in plenty of others	120.14663165288319
And Beppo led him outside the walls said the count	40.818204280481304
Exactly so a carriage was waiting at the end of the Via Macello	37.14469677456489
Beppo got in inviting the Frenchman to follow him and he did not wait to be asked twice	49.22082711486574
He gallantly offered the righthand seat to Beppo and sat by him	234.78513327866756
Beppo told him he was going to take him to a villa a league from Rome the Frenchman assured him he would follow him to the end of the world	54.728933115380045
The coachman went up the Via di Ripetta and the Porta San Paolo and when they were two hundred yards outside as the Frenchman became somewhat too forward Beppo put a brace of pistols to his head the coachman pulled up and did the same	242.18745835083465
At the same time four of the band who were concealed on the banks of the Almo surrounded the carriage	86.71894936219338
The Frenchman made some resistance and nearly strangled Beppo but he could not resist five armed men and was forced to yield	146.59670153718213
They made him get out walk along the banks of the river and then brought him to Teresa and Luigi who were waiting for him in the catacombs of St	81.64269162546043
Well said the count turning towards Franz it seems to me that this is a very likely story	50.08556120764143
What do you say to it	210.0621682739371
Why that I should think it very amusing replied Franz if it had happened to anyone but poor Albert	186.39786682936054
And in truth if you had not found me here said the count it might have proved a gallant adventure which would have cost your friend dear but now be assured his alarm will be the only serious consequence	106.93839617884223
And shall we go and find him inquired Franz	147.99588293859844
He is in a very picturesque placedo you know the catacombs of St	643.0742039318534
I was never in them but I have often resolved to visit them	55.032955738265414
Well here is an opportunity made to your hand and it would be difficult to contrive a better	69.73965290712923
That is of no consequence I always have one ready day and night	268.4263789691746
I am a very capricious being and I should tell you that sometimes when I rise or after my dinner or in the middle of the night I resolve on starting for some particular point and away I go	136.35489718631703
The count rang and a footman appeared	219.17236702128923
Order out the carriage he said and remove the pistols which are in the holsters	141.73047563156396
You need not awaken the coachman Ali will drive	541.0627990871193
In a very short time the noise of wheels was heard and the carriage stopped at the door	23.553466407533676
The count took out his watch	33.96899926274126
We might start at five oclock and be in time but the delay may cause your friend to pass an uneasy night and therefore we had better go with all speed to extricate him from the hands of the infidels	93.17529448963884
Are you still resolved to accompany me	50.37931920421775
Franz and the count went downstairs accompanied by Peppino	423.75725458914206
At the door they found the carriage	17.760724727107526
Ali was on the box in whom Franz recognized the dumb slave of the grotto of Monte Cristo	87.98997501070227
Franz and the count got into the carriage	11.656200416641175
Peppino placed himself beside Ali and they set off at a rapid pace	38.67012447967131
Ali had received his instructions and went down the Corso crossed the Campo Vaccino went up the Strada San Gregorio and reached the gates of St	252.30134180797816
Then the porter raised some difficulties but the Count of Monte Cristo produced a permit from the governor of Rome allowing him to leave or enter the city at any hour of the day or night the portcullis was therefore raised the porter had a louis for his trouble and they went on their way	76.61704352367424
The road which the carriage now traversed was the ancient Appian Way and bordered with tombs	1498.8067537755924
From time to time by the light of the moon which began to rise Franz imagined that he saw something like a sentinel appear at various points among the ruins and suddenly retreat into the darkness on a signal from Peppino	150.67661345092037
A short time before they reached the Baths of Caracalla the carriage stopped Peppino opened the door and the count and Franz alighted	119.97990966998509
In ten minutes said the count to his companion we shall be there	26.63881414288401
He then took Peppino aside gave him an order in a low voice and Peppino went away taking with him a torch brought with them in the carriage	114.78459704557197
Five minutes elapsed during which Franz saw the shepherd going along a narrow path that led over the irregular and broken surface of the Campagna and finally he disappeared in the midst of the tall red herbage which seemed like the bristling mane of an enormous lion	175.48933884173266
Now said the count let us follow him	18.067426743402358
Franz and the count in their turn then advanced along the same path which at the distance of a hundred paces led them over a declivity to the bottom of a small valley	66.37572258689707
They then perceived two men conversing in the obscurity	146.5994042544429
Ought we to go on asked Franz of the count or should we pause	284.97757528335677
Let us go on Peppino will have warned the sentry of our coming	164.00035062804642
One of the two men was Peppino and the other a bandit on the lookout	194.4018414746667
Franz and the count advanced and the bandit saluted them	422.17172349052913
Your excellency said Peppino addressing the count if you will follow me the opening of the catacombs is close at hand	85.28991684023579
Go on then replied the count	1.5394837736641305
They came to an opening behind a clump of bushes and in the midst of a pile of rocks by which a man could scarcely pass	53.517069919041184
Peppino glided first into this crevice after they got along a few paces the passage widened	452.39775170062734
Peppino passed lighted his torch and turned to see if they came after him	59.915559205669766
The count first reached an open space and Franz followed him closely	110.49627432726375
The passageway sloped in a gentle descent enlarging as they proceeded still Franz and the count were compelled to advance in a stooping posture and were scarcely able to proceed abreast of one another	352.40818075130375
They went on a hundred and fifty paces in this way and then were stopped by Who comes there At the same time they saw the reflection of a torch on a carbine barrel	75.81721085349973
A friend responded Peppino and advancing alone towards the sentry he said a few words to him in a low tone and then he like the first saluted the nocturnal visitors making a sign that they might proceed	76.75751986962895
Behind the sentinel was a staircase with twenty steps	335.8511024891119
Franz and the count descended these and found themselves in a mortuary chamber	271.97512928099496
Five corridors diverged like the rays of a star and the walls dug into niches which were arranged one above the other in the shape of coffins showed that they were at last in the catacombs	151.68284200828631
Down one of the corridors whose extent it was impossible to determine rays of light were visible	174.53836453427638
The count laid his hand on Franzs shoulder	131.94003565541723
Would you like to see a camp of bandits in repose he inquired	520.1886569637801
Peppino obeyed and Franz and the count were in utter darkness except that fifty paces in advance of them a reddish glare more evident since Peppino had put out his torch was visible along the wall	145.21034835050554
They advanced silently the count guiding Franz as if he had the singular faculty of seeing in the dark	173.0306880751503
Franz himself however saw his way more plainly in proportion as he went on towards the light which served in some manner as a guide	108.59036468429402
Three arcades were before them and the middle one was used as a door	155.21457178673822
These arcades opened on one side into the corridor where the count and Franz were and on the other into a large square chamber entirely surrounded by niches similar to those of which we have spoken	101.18434046316024
In the midst of this chamber were four stones which had formerly served as an altar as was evident from the cross which still surmounted them	277.50310530601126
A lamp placed at the base of a pillar lighted up with its pale and flickering flame the singular scene which presented itself to the eyes of the two visitors concealed in the shadow	95.09134219532766
A man was seated with his elbow leaning on the column and was reading with his back turned to the arcades through the openings of which the newcomers contemplated him	90.32338604434179
This was the chief of the band Luigi Vampa	920.4086139848805
Around him and in groups according to their fancy lying in their mantles or with their backs against a sort of stone bench which went all round the columbarium were to be seen twenty brigands or more each having his carbine within reach	309.0856966922268
At the other end silent scarcely visible and like a shadow was a sentinel who was walking up and down before a grotto which was only distinguishable because in that spot the darkness seemed more dense than elsewhere	129.76029714003815
When the count thought Franz had gazed sufficiently on this picturesque tableau he raised his finger to his lips to warn him to be silent and ascending the three steps which led to the corridor of the columbarium entered the chamber by the middle arcade and advanced towards Vampa who was so intent on the book before him that he did not hear the noise of his footsteps	74.95740783600186
Who comes there cried the sentinel who was less abstracted and who saw by the lamplight a shadow approaching his chief	225.35982310592297
At this challenge Vampa rose quickly drawing at the same moment a pistol from his girdle	35.13313235455564
In a moment all the bandits were on their feet and twenty carbines were levelled at the count	180.87061867202524
Well said he in a voice perfectly calm and no muscle of his countenance disturbed well my dear Vampa it appears to me that you receive a friend with a great deal of ceremony	126.33761233421019
Ground arms exclaimed the chief with an imperative sign of the hand while with the other he took off his hat respectfully then turning to the singular personage who had caused this scene he said Your pardon your excellency but I was so far from expecting the honor of a visit that I did not really recognize you	54.111818508167
It seems that your memory is equally short in everything Vampa said the count and that not only do you forget peoples faces but also the conditions you make with them	175.58000562438073
What conditions have I forgotten your excellency inquired the bandit with the air of a man who having committed an error is anxious to repair it	69.10217135206777
Was it not agreed asked the count that not only my person but also that of my friends should be respected by you	59.847473235574384
And how have I broken that treaty your excellency	460.1044980272157
You have this evening carried off and conveyed hither the Viscount Albert de Morcerf	244.68118514107786
Well continued the count in a tone that made Franz shudder this young gentleman is one of my friendsthis young gentleman lodges in the same hotel as myselfthis young gentleman has been up and down the Corso for eight hours in my private carriage and yet I repeat to you you have carried him off and conveyed him hither and added the count taking the letter from his pocket you have set a ransom on him as if he were an utter stranger	88.83641196737943
Why did you not tell me all thisyou inquired the brigand chief turning towards his men who all retreated before his look	251.2790388196294
Why have you caused me thus to fail in my word towards a gentleman like the count who has all our lives in his hands By heavens if I thought one of you knew that the young gentleman was the friend of his excellency I would blow his brains out with my own hand	78.59506840294316
Well said the count turning towards Franz I told you there was some mistake in this	54.97626935671014
Are you not alone asked Vampa with uneasiness	184.64752881359246
I am with the person to whom this letter was addressed and to whom I desired to prove that Luigi Vampa was a man of his word	72.32611750258431
Come your excellency the count added turning to Franz here is Luigi Vampa who will himself express to you his deep regret at the mistake he has committed	144.4717644829696
Franz approached the chief advancing several steps to meet him	52.55065470453702
Welcome among us your excellency he said to him you heard what the count just said and also my reply let me add that I would not for the four thousand piastres at which I had fixed your friends ransom that this had happened	99.2078645443582
But said Franz looking round him uneasily where is the viscountI do not see him	168.01666884520847
Nothing has happened to him I hope said the count frowningly	163.10544268050796
The prisoner is there replied Vampa pointing to the hollow space in front of which the bandit was on guard and I will go myself and tell him he is free	76.3021937404374
The chief went towards the place he had pointed out as Alberts prison and Franz and the count followed him	140.66877557240377
What is the prisoner doing inquired Vampa of the sentinel	510.3852265391151
Ma foi captain replied the sentry I do not know for the last hour I have not heard him stir	45.101490879203915
Come in your excellency said Vampa	9047.06897061641
The count and Franz ascended seven or eight steps after the chief who drew back a bolt and opened a door	75.55811159511993
Then by the gleam of a lamp similar to that which lighted the columbarium Albert was to be seen wrapped up in a cloak which one of the bandits had lent him lying in a corner in profound slumber	116.62086555640198
Come said the count smiling with his own peculiar smile not so bad for a man who is to be shot at seven oclock tomorrow morning	28.743117319404185
Vampa looked at Albert with a kind of admiration he was not insensible to such a proof of courage	50.687673721713665
You are right your excellency he said this must be one of your friends	40.737403326750226
Then going to Albert he touched him on the shoulder saying Will your excellency please to awaken	264.49768138738705
Albert stretched out his arms rubbed his eyelids and opened his eyes	47.79961577176659
Oh said he is it you captain You should have allowed me to sleep	85.13602451093288
I had such a delightful dream	565.4442329738246
I was dancing the galop at Torlonias with the Countess G	303.41997790429053
Then he drew his watch from his pocket that he might see how time sped	68.33738516463971
Why the devil do you rouse me at this hour	84.55451940216261
To tell you that you are free your excellency	75.15333902371218
My dear fellow replied Albert with perfect ease of mind remember for the future Napoleons maxim Never awaken me but for bad news if you had let me sleep on I should have finished my galop and have been grateful to you all my life	155.91158658302993
So then they have paid my ransom	241.98035714291095
Well then how am I free	610.8489788417629
A person to whom I can refuse nothing has come to demand you	87.94438379704937
Really Then that person is a most amiable person	109.4171716270981
Albert looked around and perceived Franz	5207.954203931926
What said he is it you my dear Franz whose devotion and friendship are thus displayed	262.1862486085629
No not I replied Franz but our neighbor the Count of Monte Cristo	20.613798335871447
Oh my dear count said Albert gayly arranging his cravat and wristbands you are really most kind and I hope you will consider me as under eternal obligations to you in the first place for the carriage and in the next for this visit and he put out his hand to the count who shuddered as he gave his own but who nevertheless did give it	79.07525677539593
The bandit gazed on this scene with amazement he was evidently accustomed to see his prisoners tremble before him and yet here was one whose gay temperament was not for a moment altered as for Franz he was enchanted at the way in which Albert had sustained the national honor in the presence of the bandit	117.78748728201084
My dear Albert he said if you will make haste we shall yet have time to finish the night at Torlonias	107.9812348825104
You may conclude your interrupted galop so that you will owe no illwill to Signor Luigi who has indeed throughout this whole affair acted like a gentleman	266.2659850718152
You are decidedly right and we may reach the Palazzo by two oclock	91.40453717510243
Signor Luigi continued Albert is there any formality to fulfil before I take leave of your excellency	150.88117780290906
None sir replied the bandit you are as free as air	190.17714084343
Well then a happy and merry life to you	323.0964876928574
And Albert followed by Franz and the count descended the staircase crossed the square chamber where stood all the bandits hat in hand	101.26382702390852
Peppino said the brigand chief give me the torch	133.78238870075302
What are you going to do inquired the count	20.56799922316972
I will show you the way back myself said the captain that is the least honor that I can render to your excellency	97.11298908996568
And taking the lighted torch from the hands of the herdsman he preceded his guests not as a servant who performs an act of civility but like a king who precedes ambassadors	191.06456330383782
On reaching the door he bowed	100.08816474420543
And now your excellency added he allow me to repeat my apologies and I hope you will not entertain any resentment at what has occurred	80.47767744842427
No my dear Vampa replied the count besides you compensate for your mistakes in so gentlemanly a way that one almost feels obliged to you for having committed them	178.2097934892659
Gentlemen added the chief turning towards the young men perhaps the offer may not appear very tempting to you but if you should ever feel inclined to pay me a second visit wherever I may be you shall be welcome	79.08834482787195
The count went out first then Albert	306.7147168804106
Has your excellency anything to ask me said Vampa with a smile	38.37462216995656
Yes I have replied Franz I am curious to know what work you were perusing with so much attention as we entered	78.79757419178475
Csars Commentaries said the bandit it is my favorite work	71.8736860224464
Well are you coming asked Albert	112.2169654461381
Yes replied Franz here I am and he in his turn left the caves	123.34891880283054
Ah your pardon said Albert turning round will you allow me captain	97.6937267404839
And he lighted his cigar at Vampas torch	12787.114819542592
Now my dear count he said let us on with all the speed we may	75.59843026038865
I am enormously anxious to finish my night at the Duke of Braccianos	168.10756785898633
They found the carriage where they had left it	19.19062041165293
The count said a word in Arabic to Ali and the horses went on at great speed	158.52962632324787
It was just two oclock by Alberts watch when the two friends entered into the dancingroom	143.1556970432592
Their return was quite an event but as they entered together all uneasiness on Alberts account ceased instantly	476.82345922783117
Madame said the Viscount of Morcerf advancing towards the countess yesterday you were so condescending as to promise me a galop I am rather late in claiming this gracious promise but here is my friend whose character for veracity you well know and he will assure you the delay arose from no fault of mine	211.06862612746121
And as at this moment the orchestra gave the signal for the waltz Albert put his arm round the waist of the countess and disappeared with her in the whirl of dancers	148.41784327556988
In the meanwhile Franz was considering the singular shudder that had passed over the Count of Monte Cristo at the moment when he had been in some sort forced to give his hand to Albert	41.29958803353958
The first words that Albert uttered to his friend on the following morning contained a request that Franz would accompany him on a visit to the count true the young man had warmly and energetically thanked the count on the previous evening but services such as he had rendered could never be too often acknowledged	128.6745259932531
Franz who seemed attracted by some invisible influence towards the count in which terror was strangely mingled felt an extreme reluctance to permit his friend to be exposed alone to the singular fascination that this mysterious personage seemed to exercise over him and therefore made no objection to Alberts request but at once accompanied him to the desired spot and after a short delay the count joined them in the salon	148.24304993355415
My dear count said Albert advancing to meet him permit me to repeat the poor thanks I offered last night and to assure you that the remembrance of all I owe to you will never be effaced from my memory believe me as long as I live I shall never cease to dwell with grateful recollection on the prompt and important service you rendered me and also to remember that to you I am indebted even for my life	103.5814782635993
My very good friend and excellent neighbor replied the count with a smile you really exaggerate my trifling exertions	246.1864260825936
You owe me nothing but some trifle of 20000 francs which you have been saved out of your travelling expenses so that there is not much of a score between usbut you must really permit me to congratulate you on the ease and unconcern with which you resigned yourself to your fate and the perfect indifference you manifested as to the turn events might take	168.02915345593863
Upon my word said Albert I deserve no credit for what I could not help namely a determination to take everything as I found it and to let those bandits see that although men get into troublesome scrapes all over the world there is no nation but the French that can smile even in the face of grim Death himself	194.60124378498122
All that however has nothing to do with my obligations to you and I now come to ask you whether in my own person my family or connections I can in any way serve you My father the Comte de Morcerf although of Spanish origin possesses considerable influence both at the court of France and Madrid and I unhesitatingly place the best services of myself and all to whom my life is dear at your disposal	95.92619657156055
Monsieur de Morcerf replied the count your offer far from surprising me is precisely what I expected from you and I accept it in the same spirit of hearty sincerity with which it is madenay I will go still further and say that I had previously made up my mind to ask a great favor at your hands	129.03844743751844
I am wholly a stranger to Parisit is a city I have never yet seen	159.85791857829636
Is it possible exclaimed Albert that you have reached your present age without visiting the finest capital in the world I can scarcely credit it	94.08218546036875
Nevertheless it is quite true still I agree with you in thinking that my present ignorance of the first city in Europe is a reproach to me in every way and calls for immediate correction but in all probability I should have performed so important so necessary a duty as that of making myself acquainted with the wonders and beauties of your justly celebrated capital had I known any person who would have introduced me into the fashionable world but unfortunately I possessed no acquaintance there and of necessity was compelled to abandon the idea	160.93312454223815
So distinguished an individual as yourself cried Albert could scarcely have required an introduction	222.13552656898491
You are most kind but as regards myself I can find no merit I possess save that as a millionaire I might have become a partner in the speculations of M	122.94393077915092
Rothschild but as my motive in travelling to your capital would not have been for the pleasure of dabbling in stocks I stayed away till some favorable chance should present itself of carrying my wish into execution	259.4994859441135
Your offer however smooths all difficulties and I have only to ask you my dear M	27.640158790409924
de Morcerf these words were accompanied by a most peculiar smile whether you undertake upon my arrival in France to open to me the doors of that fashionable world of which I know no more than a Huron or a native of CochinChina	125.66895441039574
Oh that I do and with infinite pleasure answered Albert and so much the more readily as a letter received this morning from my father summons me to Paris in consequence of a treaty of marriage my dear Franz do not smile I beg of you with a family of high standing and connected with the very cream of Parisian society	134.30967656201622
Connected by marriage you mean said Franz laughingly	1225.1361502664206
Well never mind how it is answered Albert it comes to the same thing in the end	55.70133550795641
Perhaps by the time you return to Paris I shall be quite a sober staid father of a family A most edifying representative I shall make of all the domestic virtuesdont you think so But as regards your wish to visit our fine city my dear count I can only say that you may command me and mine to any extent you please	166.61986307275123
Then it is settled said the count and I give you my solemn assurance that I only waited an opportunity like the present to realize plans that I have long meditated	126.51253204869705
Franz did not doubt that these plans were the same concerning which the count had dropped a few words in the grotto of Monte Cristo and while the count was speaking the young man watched him closely hoping to read something of his purpose in his face but his countenance was inscrutable especially when as in the present case it was veiled in a sphinxlike smile	81.08299032823193
But tell me now count exclaimed Albert delighted at the idea of having to chaperon so distinguished a person as Monte Cristo tell me truly whether you are in earnest or if this project of visiting Paris is merely one of the chimerical and uncertain air castles of which we make so many in the course of our lives but which like a house built on the sand is liable to be blown over by the first puff of wind	153.96669091476406
I pledge you my honor returned the count that I mean to do as I have said both inclination and positive necessity compel me to visit Paris	119.02896309528478
When do you propose going thither	10548.355824729071
Have you made up your mind when you shall be there yourself	43.1086994855613
Certainly I have in a fortnight or three weeks time that is to say as fast as I can get there	101.81339074588759
Nay said the Count I will give you three months ere I join you you see I make an ample allowance for all delays and difficulties	149.8811081379526
And in three months time said Albert you will be at my house	27.74268435137227
Shall we make a positive appointment for a particular day and hour inquired the count only let me warn you that I am proverbial for my punctilious exactitude in keeping my engagements	169.47329177556716
Day for day hour for hour said Albert that will suit me to a dot	104.7627841016594
So be it then replied the count and extending his hand towards a calendar suspended near the chimneypiece he said today is the 21st of February and drawing out his watch added it is exactly halfpast ten oclock	108.25175388001637
Now promise me to remember this and expect me the 21st of May at the same hour in the forenoon	108.56743496518581
Capital exclaimed Albert your breakfast shall be waiting	49.57052129364122
Have you bachelors apartments there I hope my coming will not put you to any inconvenience	98.70174276517761
I reside in my fathers house but occupy a pavilion at the farther side of the courtyard entirely separated from the main building	149.98978000283114
Quite sufficient replied the count as taking out his tablets he wrote down No	272.02993151961726
27 Rue du Helder 21st May halfpast ten in the morning	17.170312555547966
Now then said the count returning his tablets to his pocket make yourself perfectly easy the hand of your timepiece will not be more accurate in marking the time than myself	281.62518996407397
Shall I see you again ere my departure asked Albert	402.10465820502577
That depends when do you leave	33.687634853905784
In that case I must say adieu to you as I am compelled to go to Naples and shall not return hither before Saturday evening or Sunday morning	104.6349140618817
And you baron pursued the count addressing Franz do you also depart tomorrow	443.53940988958874
No for Venice I shall remain in Italy for another year or two	52.83405024036778
Then we shall not meet in Paris	19.475466592434866
I fear I shall not have that honor	51.18033342222825
Well since we must part said the count holding out a hand to each of the young men allow me to wish you both a safe and pleasant journey	71.67333484787845
It was the first time the hand of Franz had come in contact with that of the mysterious individual before him and unconsciously he shuddered at its touch for it felt cold and icy as that of a corpse	127.18467221291318
Let us understand each other said Albert it is agreedis it notthat you are to be at No	167.48819220605606
27 in the Rue du Helder on the 21st of May at halfpast ten in the morning and your word of honor passed for your punctuality	62.28258669131787
The 21st of May at halfpast ten in the morning Rue du Helder No	17.77498632011912
The young men then rose and bowing to the count quitted the room	24.932727195585485
What is the matter asked Albert of Franz when they had returned to their own apartments you seem more than commonly thoughtful	182.12554091558647
I will confess to you Albert replied Franz the count is a very singular person and the appointment you have made to meet him in Paris fills me with a thousand apprehensions	98.02675637327758
My dear fellow exclaimed Albert what can there possibly be in that to excite uneasiness Why you must have lost your senses	128.8040662332901
Whether I am in my senses or not answered Franz that is the way I feel	122.93745133213949
Listen to me Franz said Albert I am glad that the occasion has presented itself for saying this to you for I have noticed how cold you are in your bearing towards the count while he on the other hand has always been courtesy itself to us	77.25372237125464
Have you anything particular against him	17.97626705648158
Did you ever meet him previously to coming hither	3105.26443818223
Will you promise me not to repeat a single word of what I am about to tell you	25.24445601706167
Franz then related to his friend the history of his excursion to the Island of Monte Cristo and of his finding a party of smugglers there and the two Corsican bandits with them	94.03195727308609
He dwelt with considerable force and energy on the almost magical hospitality he had received from the count and the magnificence of his entertainment in the grotto of the Thousand and One Nights	113.79822089654641
He recounted with circumstantial exactitude all the particulars of the supper the hashish the statues the dream and how at his awakening there remained no proof or trace of all these events save the small yacht seen in the distant horizon driving under full sail toward PortoVecchio	389.6688146849066
Then he detailed the conversation overheard by him at the Colosseum between the count and Vampa in which the count had promised to obtain the release of the bandit Peppinoan engagement which as our readers are aware he most faithfully fulfilled	222.068297857122
At last he arrived at the adventure of the preceding night and the embarrassment in which he found himself placed by not having sufficient cash by six or seven hundred piastres to make up the sum required and finally of his application to the count and the picturesque and satisfactory result that followed	132.30931838305796
Albert listened with the most profound attention	31.167124496382037
Well said he when Franz had concluded what do you find to object to in all you have related The count is fond of travelling and being rich possesses a vessel of his own	156.4135150023869
Go but to Portsmouth or Southampton and you will find the harbors crowded with the yachts belonging to such of the English as can afford the expense and have the same liking for this amusement	278.09046326754316
Now by way of having a restingplace during his excursions avoiding the wretched cookerywhich has been trying its best to poison me during the last four months while you have manfully resisted its effects for as many yearsand obtaining a bed on which it is possible to slumber Monte Cristo has furnished for himself a temporary abode where you first found him but to prevent the possibility of the Tuscan government taking a fancy to his enchanted palace and thereby depriving him of the advantages naturally expected from so large an outlay of capital he has wisely enough purchased the island and taken its name	292.2695421566883
Just ask yourself my good fellow whether there are not many persons of our acquaintance who assume the names of lands and properties they never in their lives were masters of	150.5419161227216
But said Franz the Corsican bandits that were among the crew of his vessel	134.85317131620167
Why really the thing seems to me simple enough	48.71548964582082
Nobody knows better than yourself that the bandits of Corsica are not rogues or thieves but purely and simply fugitives driven by some sinister motive from their native town or village and that their fellowship involves no disgrace or stigma for my own part I protest that should I ever go to Corsica my first visit ere even I presented myself to the mayor or prefect should be to the bandits of Colomba if I could only manage to find them for on my conscience they are a race of men I admire greatly	293.34501766290447
Still persisted Franz I suppose you will allow that such men as Vampa and his band are regular villains who have no other motive than plunder when they seize your person	214.04620452099027
How do you explain the influence the count evidently possessed over those ruffians	831.4779596491784
My good friend as in all probability I own my present safety to that influence it would ill become me to search too closely into its source therefore instead of condemning him for his intimacy with outlaws you must give me leave to excuse any little irregularity there may be in such a connection not altogether for preserving my life for my own idea was that it never was in much danger but certainly for saving me 4000 piastres which being translated means neither more nor less than 24000 livres of our moneya sum at which most assuredly I should never have been estimated in France proving most indisputably added Albert with a laugh that no prophet is honored in his own country	242.04221880269367
Talking of countries replied Franz of what country is the count what is his native tongue whence does he derive his immense fortune and what were those events of his early lifea life as marvellous as unknownthat have tinctured his succeeding years with so dark and gloomy a misanthropy Certainly these are questions that in your place I should like to have answered	301.12225202793695
My dear Franz replied Albert when upon receipt of my letter you found the necessity of asking the counts assistance you promptly went to him saying My friend Albert de Morcerf is in danger help me to deliver him	143.42968350327652
Was not that nearly what you said	36.787880687849835
Well then did he ask you Who is M	76.54938160370499
Albert de Morcerf how does he come by his namehis fortune what are his means of existence what is his birthplace of what country is he a native Tell me did he put all these questions to you	160.32837270295298
I confess he asked me none	1217.5154292491166
No he merely came and freed me from the hands of Signor Vampa where I can assure you in spite of all my outward appearance of ease and unconcern I did not very particularly care to remain	159.4479686890036
Now then Franz when for services so promptly and unhesitatingly rendered he but asks me in return to do for him what is done daily for any Russian prince or Italian nobleman who may pass through Parismerely to introduce him into societywould you have me refuse My good fellow you must have lost your senses to think it possible I could act with such coldblooded policy	262.77459097180383
And this time it must be confessed that contrary to the usual state of affairs in discussions between the young men the effective arguments were all on Alberts side	167.83447908424543
Well said Franz with a sigh do as you please my dear viscount for your arguments are beyond my powers of refutation	123.70969886325042
Still in spite of all you must admit that this Count of Monte Cristo is a most singular personage	34.68884301518902
He is a philanthropist answered the other and no doubt his motive in visiting Paris is to compete for the Monthyon prize given as you are aware to whoever shall be proved to have most materially advanced the interests of virtue and humanity	239.76655651038814
If my vote and interest can obtain it for him I will readily give him the one and promise the other	78.43378347866675
And now my dear Franz let us talk of something else	26.234821381418957
Come shall we take our luncheon and then pay a last visit to St	340.13953437201974
Franz silently assented and the following afternoon at halfpast five oclock the young men parted	213.64574900524013
Albert de Morcerf to return to Paris and Franz dpinay to pass a fortnight at Venice	111.0016829689046
But ere he entered his travelling carriage Albert fearing that his expected guest might forget the engagement he had entered into placed in the care of a waiter at the hotel a card to be delivered to the Count of Monte Cristo on which beneath the name of Viscount Albert de Morcerf he had written in pencil	126.3450792585056
27 Rue du Helder on the 21st May halfpast ten A	328.4799215245009
In the house in the Rue du Helder where Albert had invited the Count of Monte Cristo everything was being prepared on the morning of the 21st of May to do honor to the occasion	36.585111452771976
Albert de Morcerf inhabited a pavilion situated at the corner of a large court and directly opposite another building in which were the servants apartments	160.69869856179628
Two windows only of the pavilion faced the street three other windows looked into the court and two at the back into the garden	147.01303969191153
Between the court and the garden built in the heavy style of the imperial architecture was the large and fashionable dwelling of the Count and Countess of Morcerf	167.85252117311956
A high wall surrounded the whole of the property surmounted at intervals by vases filled with flowers and broken in the centre by a large gate of gilded iron which served as the carriage entrance	113.56617841112109
A small door close to the lodge of the concierge gave ingress and egress to the servants and masters when they were on foot	152.5512269013551
It was easy to discover that the delicate care of a mother unwilling to part from her son and yet aware that a young man of the viscounts age required the full exercise of his liberty had chosen this habitation for Albert	151.27291386183515
There were not lacking however evidences of what we may call the intelligent egoism of a youth who is charmed with the indolent careless life of an only son and who lives as it were in a gilded cage	229.83256076158509
By means of the two windows looking into the street Albert could see all that passed the sight of what is going on is necessary to young men who always want to see the world traverse their horizon even if that horizon is only a public thoroughfare	143.1900791510144
Then should anything appear to merit a more minute examination Albert de Morcerf could follow up his researches by means of a small gate similar to that close to the concierges door and which merits a particular description	264.6008677782937
It was a little entrance that seemed never to have been opened since the house was built so entirely was it covered with dust and dirt but the welloiled hinges and locks told quite another story	258.7584153303117
This door was a mockery to the concierge from whose vigilance and jurisdiction it was free and like that famous portal in the Arabian Nights opening at the Sesame of Ali Baba it was wo nt to swing backward at a cabalistic word or a concerted tap from without from the sweetest voices or whitest fingers in the world	295.53506445162475
At the end of a long corridor with which the door communicated and which formed the antechamber was on the right Alberts breakfastroom looking into the court and on the left the salon looking into the garden	105.68225058501743
Shrubs and creeping plants covered the windows and hid from the garden and court these two apartments the only rooms into which as they were on the ground floor the prying eyes of the curious could penetrate	98.56250619531782
On the floor above were similar rooms with the addition of a third formed out of the antechamber these three rooms were a salon a boudoir and a bedroom	161.70783625502744
The salon downstairs was only an Algerian divan for the use of smokers	455.8597913232093
The boudoir upstairs communicated with the bedchamber by an invisible door on the staircase it was evident that every precaution had been taken	53.07762957992608
Above this floor was a large atelier which had been increased in size by pulling down the partitionsa pandemonium in which the artist and the dandy strove for preeminence	507.0901413918889
There were collected and piled up all Alberts successive caprices huntinghorns bassviols flutesa whole orchestra for Albert had had not a taste but a fancy for music easels palettes brushes pencilsfor music had been succeeded by painting foils boxinggloves broadswords and singlesticksfor following the example of the fashionable young men of the time Albert de Morcerf cultivated with far more perseverance than music and drawing the three arts that complete a dandys education i	837.3698590625469
fencing boxing and singlestick and it was here that he received Grisier Cooks and Charles Leboucher	490.90234892729677
The rest of the furniture of this privileged apartment consisted of old cabinets filled with Chinese porcelain and Japanese vases Lucca della Robbia faences and Palissy platters of old armchairs in which perhaps had sat Henry IV	1457.368331371856
or Richelieufor two of these armchairs adorned with a carved shield on which were engraved the fleurdelis of France on an azure field evidently came from the Louvre or at least some royal residence	361.63444720107367
Over these dark and sombre chairs were thrown splendid stuffs dyed beneath Persias sun or woven by the fingers of the women of Calcutta or of Chandernagor	626.7908515481159
What these stuffs did there it was impossible to say they awaited while gratifying the eyes a destination unknown to their owner himself in the meantime they filled the place with their golden and silky reflections	411.88885883016314
In the centre of the room was a Roller and Blanchet baby grand piano in rosewood but holding the potentialities of an orchestra in its narrow and sonorous cavity and groaning beneath the weight of the chefsduvre of Beethoven Weber Mozart Haydn Grtry and Porpora	783.6410630265713
On the walls over the doors on the ceiling were swords daggers Malay creeses maces battleaxes gilded damasked and inlaid suits of armor dried plants minerals and stuffed birds their flamecolored wings outspread in motionless flight and their beaks forever open	2210.030784050739
This was Alberts favorite lounging place	685.3110989998884
However the morning of the appointment the young man had established himself in the small salon downstairs	131.04516108561558
There on a table surrounded at some distance by a large and luxurious divan every species of tobacco knownfrom the yellow tobacco of Petersburg to the black of Sinai and so on along the scale from Maryland and Porto Rico to Latakiawas exposed in pots of crackled earthenware of which the Dutch are so fond beside them in boxes of fragrant wood were ranged according to their size and quality puros regalias havanas and manillas and in an open cabinet a collection of German pipes of chibouques with their amber mouthpieces ornamented with coral and of narghiles with their long tubes of morocco awaiting the caprice or the sympathy of the smokers	670.7132317301179
Albert had himself presided at the arrangement or rather the symmetrical derangement which after coffee the guests at a breakfast of modern days love to contemplate through the vapor that escapes from their mouths and ascends in long and fanciful wreaths to the ceiling	500.76722719495314
At a quarter to ten a valet entered he composed with a little groom named John and who only spoke English all Alberts establishment although the cook of the hotel was always at his service and on great occasions the counts chasseur also	330.0022969020985
This valet whose name was Germain and who enjoyed the entire confidence of his young master held in one hand a number of papers and in the other a packet of letters which he gave to Albert	70.37847642720256
Albert glanced carelessly at the different missives selected two written in a small and delicate hand and enclosed in scented envelopes opened them and perused their contents with some attention	677.7512848016898
How did these letters come said he	51.410746727644934
One by the post Madame Danglars footman left the other	169.9683652247813
Let Madame Danglars know that I accept the place she offers me in her box	178.12498612995194
Wait then during the day tell Rosa that when I leave the Opera I will sup with her as she wishes	147.93537525056854
Take her six bottles of different wineCyprus sherry and Malaga and a barrel of Ostend oysters get them at Borels and be sure you say they are for me	465.74456231914354
At what oclock sir do you breakfast	57.77602760356266
Very well at half past ten	34.87703615527918
Debray will perhaps be obliged to go to the ministerand besides Albert looked at his tablets it is the hour I told the count 21st May at half past ten and though I do not much rely upon his promise I wish to be punctual	104.92097167792744
If you wish I will inquire	2362.3173811389133
Yes ask her for one of her liqueur cellarets mine is incomplete and tell her I shall have the honor of seeing her about three oclock and that I request permission to introduce someone to her	123.74131518226898
Albert threw himself on the divan tore off the cover of two or three of the papers looked at the theatre announcements made a face seeing they gave an opera and not a ballet hunted vainly amongst the advertisements for a new toothpowder of which he had heard and threw down one after the other the three leading papers of Paris muttering	224.70606687163627
These papers become more and more stupid every day	98.60760675674219
A moment after a carriage stopped before the door and the servant announced M	62.40259148627261
A tall young man with light hair clear gray eyes and thin and compressed lips dressed in a blue coat with beautifully carved gold buttons a white neckcloth and a tortoiseshell eyeglass suspended by a silken thread and which by an effort of the superciliary and zygomatic muscles he fixed in his eye entered with a halfofficial air without smiling or speaking	200.0345320514432
Goodmorning Lucien goodmorning said Albert your punctuality really alarms me	1277.1534963207398
What do I say punctuality You whom I expected last you arrive at five minutes to ten when the time fixed was halfpast Has the ministry resigned	383.0571106130451
No my dear fellow returned the young man seating himself on the divan reassure yourself we are tottering always but we never fall and I begin to believe that we shall pass into a state of immobility and then the affairs of the Peninsula will completely consolidate us	187.7988949427605
Ah true you drive Don Carlos out of Spain	265.04623253147406
No no my dear fellow do not confound our plans	191.13829877868395
We take him to the other side of the French frontier and offer him hospitality at Bourges	134.89597979579722
Yes he has not much to complain of Bourges is the capital of Charles VII	320.22802264376946
Do you not know that all Paris knew it yesterday and the day before it had already transpired on the Bourse and M	104.74702808937631
Danglars I do not know by what means that man contrives to obtain intelligence as soon as we do made a million	152.3487852339717
And you another order for I see you have a blue ribbon at your buttonhole	77.10439031342948
Yes they sent me the order of Charles III	536.6936519236148
Come do not affect indifference but confess you were pleased to have it	126.48427673682014
Oh it is very well as a finish to the toilet	173.28277023973047
It looks very neat on a black coat buttoned up	12.141644413076536
And makes you resemble the Prince of Wales or the Duke of Reichstadt	95.32476783413665
It is for that reason you see me so early	87.60413895430239
Because you have the order of Charles III	570.5487093201139
and you wish to announce the good news to me	25.780713772434666
No because I passed the night writing lettersfiveandtwenty despatches	17093.61156755091
I returned home at daybreak and strove to sleep but my head ached and I got up to have a ride for an hour	117.58265339129164
At the Bois de Boulogne ennui and hunger attacked me at oncetwo enemies who rarely accompany each other and who are yet leagued against me a sort of Carlorepublican alliance	446.67795317809174
I then recollected you gave a breakfast this morning and here I am	90.73755659910915
I am hungry feed me I am bored amuse me	518.6888068790483
It is my duty as your host returned Albert ringing the bell while Lucien turned over with his goldmounted cane the papers that lay on the table	152.7628632875355
Germain a glass of sherry and a biscuit	35.48065885991937
In the meantime my dear Lucien here are cigarscontraband of coursetry them and persuade the minister to sell us such instead of poisoning us with cabbage leaves	466.17393700443455
Peste I will do nothing of the kind the moment they come from government you would find them execrable	269.81621035725124

On my word said Albert you astonish me by the extent of your knowledge	62.78069683901655
Really my dear Albert replied Lucien lighting a manilla at a rosecolored taper that burnt in a beautifully enamelled standhow happy you are to have nothing to do	570.1211024791683
You do not know your own good fortune	63.527984893362486
And what would you do my dear diplomatist replied Morcerf with a slight degree of irony in his voice if you did nothing What private secretary to a minister plunged at once into European cabals and Parisian intrigues having kings and better still queens to protect parties to unite elections to direct making more use of your cabinet with your pen and your telegraph than Napoleon did of his battlefields with his sword and his victories possessing fiveandtwenty thousand francs a year besides your place a horse for which ChteauRenaud offered you four hundred louis and which you would not part with a tailor who never disappoints you with the opera the jockeyclub and other diversions can you not amuse yourself Well I will amuse you	273.3576141711499
By introducing to you a new acquaintance	144.13643920404525
I know so many men already	834.2963926077904
But you do not know this man	16.455602136024773
Where does he come fromthe end of the world	19.250736909671087
The deuce I hope he does not bring our breakfast with him	71.26245865043462
Oh no our breakfast comes from my fathers kitchen	215.80723859238614
Humiliating as such a confession is I am	51.49814586198288
de Villeforts and lawyers always give you very bad dinners	392.3513972505936
You would think they felt some remorse did you ever remark that	172.6709322502065
Ah depreciate other persons dinners you ministers give such splendid ones	1062.1758361375557
Yes but we do not invite people of fashion	1392.5394060652932
If we were not forced to entertain a parcel of country boobies because they think and vote with us we should never dream of dining at home I assure you	256.97750689254303
Well take another glass of sherry and another biscuit	602.0635641654503
You see we were quite right to pacify that country	582.4723537979505
Well Don Carlos will drink Bordeaux and in ten years we will marry his son to the little queen	103.96888172653335
You will then obtain the Golden Fleece if you are still in the ministry	223.37999015428557
I think Albert you have adopted the system of feeding me on smoke this morning	321.94411221386514
Well you must allow it is the best thing for the stomach but I hear Beauchamp in the next room you can dispute together and that will pass away the time	74.41150477634706
My dear friend said Lucien with an air of sovereign contempt do I ever read the papers	71.2619881320864
Then you will dispute the more	336.3911090274978
Come in come in said Albert rising and advancing to meet the young man	43.98493925398266
Here is Debray who detests you without reading you so he says	113.61152099752181
He is quite right returned Beauchamp for I criticise him without knowing what he does	164.39047321157952
Ah you know that already said the private secretary smiling and shaking hands with him	78.31956009179959
And what do they say of it in the world	18.679702306396567
In which world we have so many worlds in the year of grace 1838	460.3723474625955
In the entire political world of which you are one of the leaders	45.45232832295657
They say that it is quite fair and that sowing so much red you ought to reap a little blue	264.2754710500239
Come come that is not bad said Lucien	165.18690635143003
Why do you not join our party my dear Beauchamp With your talents you would make your fortune in three or four years	111.86878343269682
I only await one thing before following your advice that is a minister who will hold office for six months	121.76522932562243
My dear Albert one word for I must give poor Lucien a respite	350.27792776482846
Do we breakfast or dine I must go to the Chamber for our life is not an idle one	63.59257572053529
You only breakfast I await two persons and the instant they arrive we shall sit down to table	102.57458698858194
And what sort of persons do you expect to breakfast said Beauchamp	51.52331191253903
Then we shall have to wait two hours for the gentleman and three for the diplomatist	178.1588943152002
I shall come back to dessert keep me some strawberries coffee and cigars	1687.227842761316
I shall take a cutlet on my way to the Chamber	29.674438788425718
Do not do anything of the sort for were the gentleman a Montmorency and the diplomatist a Metternich we will breakfast at eleven in the meantime follow Debrays example and take a glass of sherry and a biscuit	345.0926113428906
Be it so I will stay I must do something to distract my thoughts	137.6389464918052
You are like Debray and yet it seems to me that when the minister is out of spirits the opposition ought to be joyous	81.94992824195299
Ah you do not know with what I am threatened	79.82582879836995
I shall hear this morning that M	102.83767453009268
Danglars make a speech at the Chamber of Deputies and at his wifes this evening I shall hear the tragedy of a peer of France	90.37366984172569
The devil take the constitutional government and since we had our choice as they say at least how could we choose that	120.37650083517048
I understand you must lay in a stock of hilarity	298.6041351313039
Danglars speeches said Debray he votes for you for he belongs to the opposition	206.83941184318738
Pardieu that is exactly the worst of all	283.16181115107923
I am waiting until you send him to speak at the Luxembourg to laugh at my ease	100.02371596092544
My dear friend said Albert to Beauchamp it is plain that the affairs of Spain are settled for you are most desperately out of humor this morning	154.98578122902134
Recollect that Parisian gossip has spoken of a marriage between myself and Mlle	177.94162067761008
Eugnie Danglars I can not in conscience therefore let you run down the speeches of a man who will one day say to me Vicomte you know I give my daughter two millions	105.08439844949808
Ah this marriage will never take place said Beauchamp	26.88891492031701
The king has made him a baron and can make him a peer but he can not make him a gentleman and the Count of Morcerf is too aristocratic to consent for the paltry sum of two million francs to a msalliance	70.54851162008762
The Viscount of Morcerf can only we d a marchioness	1364.9710157498748
But two million francs make a nice little sum replied Morcerf	280.923995284865
It is the social capital of a theatre on the boulevard or a railroad from the Jardin des Plantes to La Rpe	159.52691498902246
Never mind what he says Morcerf said Debray do you marry her	52.76703681013201
You marry a moneybag label it is true well but what does that matter It is better to have a blazon less and a figure more on it	133.95862721742895
You have seven martlets on your arms give three to your wife and you will still have four that is one more than M	105.48826973654538
de Guise had who so nearly became King of France and whose cousin was Emperor of Germany	321.4051766789352
On my word I think you are right Lucien said Albert absently	213.64472116948082
To be sure besides every millionaire is as noble as a bastardthat is he can be	135.80546982378758
Do not say that Debray returned Beauchamp laughing for here is ChteauRenaud who to cure you of your mania for paradoxes will pass the sword of Renaud de Montauban his ancestor through your body	307.19283078453867
He will sully it then returned Lucien for I am lowvery low	862.8020372837407
Oh heavens cried Beauchamp the minister quotes Branger what shall we come to next	984.9614564732399
Maximilian Morrel said the servant announcing two fresh guests	2313.301474898356
Now then to breakfast said Beauchamp for if I remember you told me you only expected two persons Albert	107.27824464436756
But before he had finished M	861.6113692720461
de ChteauRenaud a handsome young man of thirty gentleman all overthat is with the figure of a Guiche and the wit of a Mortemarttook Alberts hand	304.6153602228216
My dear Albert said he let me introduce to you M	86.46693585431647
Maximilian Morrel captain of Spahis my friend and what is morehowever the man speaks for himselfmy preserver	516.2855962471084
And he stepped on one side to give place to a young man of refined and dignified bearing with large and open brow piercing eyes and black moustache whom our readers have already seen at Marseilles under circumstances sufficiently dramatic not to be forgotten	165.9935415698283
A rich uniform half French half Oriental set off his graceful and stalwart figure and his broad chest was decorated with the order of the Legion of Honor	147.11903228280255
The young officer bowed with easy and elegant politeness	495.0249976443629
Monsieur said Albert with affectionate courtesy the count of ChteauRenaud knew how much pleasure this introduction would give me you are his friend be ours also	148.05012293114913
Well said interrupted ChteauRenaud and pray that if you should ever be in a similar predicament he may do as much for you as he did for me	70.6749378873645
What has he done asked Albert	120.80757492507585
Oh nothing worth speaking of said Morrel M	99.53176714516765
Not worth speaking of cried ChteauRenaud life is not worth speaking ofthat is rather too philosophical on my word Morrel	261.83988537980673
It is very well for you who risk your life every day but for me who only did so once	67.07302348894841
We gather from all this baron that Captain Morrel saved your life	521.3399578626636
Beauchamp my good fellow you know I am starving said Debray do not set him off on some long story	121.27024577814731
Well I do not prevent your sitting down to table replied Beauchamp ChteauRenaud can tell us while we eat our breakfast	160.19351888526535
Gentlemen said Morcerf it is only a quarter past ten and I expect someone else	106.09544750130077
Ah true a diplomatist observed Debray	257.62452139680124
Diplomat or not I do nt know I only know that he charged himself on my account with a mission which he terminated so entirely to my satisfaction that had I been king I should have instantly created him knight of all my orders even had I been able to offer him the Golden Fleece and the Garter	155.95279272847307
Well since we are not to sit down to table said Debray take a glass of sherry and tell us all about it	38.553881286232354
You all know that I had the fancy of going to Africa	195.09268325487662
It is a road your ancestors have traced for you said Albert gallantly	448.7717311006261
Yes but I doubt that your object was like theirsto rescue the Holy Sepulchre	1120.3160582937328
You are quite right Beauchamp observed the young aristocrat	542.231116435355
It was only to fight as an amateur	183.46660026195505
I can not bear duelling ever since two seconds whom I had chosen to arrange an affair forced me to break the arm of one of my best friends one whom you all knowpoor Franz dpinay	146.90677637454198
Ah true said Debray you did fight some time ago about what	124.79347316994823
The devil take me if I remember returned ChteauRenaud	538.2011559576466
But I recollect perfectly one thing that being unwilling to let such talents as mine sleep I wished to try upon the Arabs the new pistols that had been given to me	142.60576060157473
In consequence I embarked for Oran and went from thence to Constantine where I arrived just in time to witness the raising of the siege	159.94527812704172
I retreated with the rest for eightandforty hours	1971.2429904242745
I endured the rain during the day and the cold during the night tolerably well but the third morning my horse died of cold	128.8301614983055
Poor bruteaccustomed to be covered up and to have a stove in the stable the Arabian finds himself unable to bear ten degrees of cold in Arabia	255.85655002112435
That s why you want to purchase my English horse said Debray you think he will bear the cold better	109.34102775404219
You are mistaken for I have made a vow never to return to Africa	95.00709641746515
You were very much frightened then asked Beauchamp	171.92013466850435
Well yes and I had good reason to be so replied ChteauRenaud	59.840004747323576
I was retreating on foot for my horse was dead	101.63567793168677
Six Arabs came up full gallop to cut off my head	25.403107944510026
I shot two with my doublebarrelled gun and two more with my pistols but I was then disarmed and two were still left one seized me by the hair that is why I now wear it so short for no one knows what may happen the other swung a yataghan and I already felt the cold steel on my neck when this gentleman whom you see here charged them shot the one who held me by the hair and cleft the skull of the other with his sabre	152.66332886811253
He had assigned himself the task of saving a mans life that day chance caused that man to be myself	232.78396412572673
When I am rich I will order a statue of Chance from Klagmann or Marochetti	726.3111080238053
Yes said Morrel smiling it was the 5th of September the anniversary of the day on which my father was miraculously preserved therefore as far as it lies in my power I endeavor to celebrate it by some	87.0889883878897
But that is not allafter rescuing me from the sword he rescued me from the cold not by sharing his cloak with me like St	334.2298636909346
Martin but by giving me the whole then from hunger by sharing with meguess what	761.2197093718382
No his horse of which we each of us ate a slice with a hearty appetite	297.3213510973654
No the sacrifice returned ChteauRenaud ask Debray if he would sacrifice his English steed for a stranger	260.2756657630005
Not for a stranger said Debray but for a friend I might perhaps	52.983029899276126
I divined that you would become mine count replied Morrel besides as I had the honor to tell you heroism or not sacrifice or not that day I owed an offering to bad fortune in recompense for the favors good fortune had on other days granted to us	206.03532183499763
Morrel alludes continued ChteauRenaud is an admirable one which he will tell you some day when you are better acquainted with him today let us fill our stomachs and not our memories	126.1972913416334
What time do you breakfast Albert	11085.345476827833
Precisely asked Debray taking out his watch	15.228131465796569
Oh you will give me five minutes grace replied Morcerf for I also expect a preserver	432.90562614372703
Of myself cried Morcerf parbleu do you think I can not be saved as well as anyone else and that there are only Arabs who cut off heads Our breakfast is a philanthropic one and we shall have at tableat least I hope sotwo benefactors of humanity	163.94171257782764
What shall we do said Debray we have only one Monthyon prize	332.77173213991455
Well it will be given to someone who has done nothing to deserve it said Beauchamp that is the way the Academy mostly escapes from the dilemma	159.7457812062462
And where does he come from asked Debray	120.91731528887078
You have already answered the question once but so vaguely that I venture to put it a second time	225.80435305995073
Really said Albert I do not know when I invited him three months ago he was then at Rome but since that time who knows where he may have gone	50.41590628093478
And you think him capable of being exact demanded Debray	380.7790755406346
I think him capable of everything	264.849474535843
Well with the five minutes grace we have only ten left	867.8052209109293
I will profit by them to tell you something about my guest	83.04223325503517
I beg pardon interrupted Beauchamp are there any materials for an article in what you are going to tell us	71.99214160533046
Yes and for a most curious one	153.46990452587934
Go on then for I see I shall not get to the Chamber this morning and I must make up for it	41.43543051971001
I was at Rome during the last Carnival	51.57949730848284
Yes but what you do not know is that I was carried off by bandits	62.82777037324959
There are no bandits cried Debray	22.62817247604474
Yes there are and most hideous or rather most admirable ones for I found them ugly enough to frighten me	328.6048222844611
Come my dear Albert said Debray confess that your cook is behindhand that the oysters have not arrived from Ostend or Marennes and that like Madame de Maintenon you are going to replace the dish by a story	327.41992565376506
Say so at once we are sufficiently wellbred to excuse you and to listen to your history fabulous as it promises to be	218.92790906195316
And I say to you fabulous as it may seem I tell it as a true one from beginning to end	213.99300340014642
The brigands had carried me off and conducted me to a gloomy spot called the Catacombs of Saint Sebastian	240.42599106116703
I know it said ChteauRenaud I narrowly escaped catching a fever there	1726.8700578553078
And I did more than that replied Morcerf for I caught one	194.9581355777089
I was informed that I was prisoner until I paid the sum of 4000 Roman crownsabout 24000 francs	378.4134221985947
Unfortunately I had not above 1500	589581.0914043592
I was at the end of my journey and of my credit	52.96780672215125
I wrote to Franzand were he here he would confirm every wordI wrote then to Franz that if he did not come with the four thousand crowns before six at ten minutes past I should have gone to join the blessed saints and glorious martyrs in whose company I had the honor of being and Signor Luigi Vampa such was the name of the chief of these bandits would have scrupulously kept his word	143.81936085230615
But Franz did come with the four thousand crowns said ChteauRenaud	50.94746349188602
A man whose name is Franz dpinay or Albert de Morcerf has not much difficulty in procuring them	222.98280934417804
No he arrived accompanied simply by the guest I am going to present to you	35.324209675002884
Ah this gentleman is a Hercules killing Cacus a Perseus freeing Andromeda	14489.613834393696
No he is a man about my own size	207.66267928265648
He had not even a knittingneedle	195856.1698178675
He said two words to the chief and I was free	51.76542152667055
And they apologized to him for having carried you off said Beauchamp	96.11788716174524
Why he is a second Ariosto	185929.77943645822
No his name is the Count of Monte Cristo	2.2553978455406436
There is no Count of Monte Cristo said Debray	14.558088105726013
I do not think so added ChteauRenaud with the air of a man who knows the whole of the European nobility perfectly	56.038498763476426
Does anyone know anything of a Count of Monte Cristo	9.332830717347836
He comes possibly from the Holy Land and one of his ancestors possessed Calvary as the Mortemarts did the Dead Sea	717.743747342959
I think I can assist your researches said Maximilian	152.18607148073522
Monte Cristo is a little island I have often heard spoken of by the old sailors my father employeda grain of sand in the centre of the Mediterranean an atom in the infinite	216.03907709823912
Well he of whom I speak is the lord and master of this grain of sand of this atom he has purchased the title of count somewhere in Tuscany	215.7373923365693
But that ought to be visible	3417.186524476496
That is what deceives you Debray	1537.2984568734482
Have you read the Arabian Nights	589.9078032450682
Well do you know if the persons you see there are rich or poor if their sacks of wheat are not rubies or diamonds They seem like poor fishermen and suddenly they open some mysterious cavern filled with the wealth of the Indies	246.73984515183776
Which means that my Count of Monte Cristo is one of those fishermen	18.430170106995696
He has even a name taken from the book since he calls himself Sinbad the Sailor and has a cave filled with gold	136.23764759830885
And you have seen this cavern Morcerf asked Beauchamp	765.5705889557519
No but Franz has for heavens sake not a word of this before him	186.12591787609102
Franz went in with his eyes blindfolded and was waited on by mutes and by women to whom Cleopatra was a painted strumpet	538.6694998054376
Only he is not quite sure about the women for they did not come in until after he had taken hashish so that what he took for women might have been simply a row of statues	175.5918341658414
The two young men looked at Morcerf as if to sayAre you mad or are you laughing at us	155.83958678476571
And I also said Morrel thoughtfully have heard something like this from an old sailor named Penelon	266.98411381338565
Ah cried Albert it is very lucky that M	200.64662221084808
Morrel comes to aid me you are vexed are you not that he thus gives a clew to the labyrinth	116.77412536354699
My dear Albert said Debray what you tell us is so extraordinary	55.70009263427739
Ah because your ambassadors and your consuls do not tell you of themthey have no time	178.39051452697996
They are too much taken up with interfering in the affairs of their countrymen who travel	248.9986347128267
Now you get angry and attack our poor agents	1003.4285780121672
How will you have them protect you The Chamber cuts down their salaries every day so that now they have scarcely any	453.4006373583788
Will you be ambassador Albert I will send you to Constantinople	23.933087475695952
No lest on the first demonstration I make in favor of Mehemet Ali the Sultan send me the bowstring and make my secretaries strangle me	482.04387005791295
You say very true responded Debray	40.95826007245388
Yes said Albert but this has nothing to do with the existence of the Count of Monte Cristo	15.164381109019661
Doubtless but not in the same way everyone has not black slaves a princely retinue an arsenal of weapons that would do credit to an Arabian fortress horses that cost six thousand francs apiece and Greek mistresses	527.3542557156742
Have you seen the Greek mistress	1240.082155598402
I have both seen and heard her	53.928313651407294
I saw her at the theatre and heard her one morning when I breakfasted with the count	140.50979534704408
Yes but so little it can hardly be called eating	369.9223869419191
Laugh if you will the Countess G who knew Lord Ruthven declared that the count was a vampire	102.49417036858696
For a man not connected with newspapers here is the pendant to the famous seaserpent of the Constitutionnel	352.65533704733
Wild eyes the iris of which contracts or dilates at pleasure said Debray facial angle strongly developed magnificent forehead livid complexion black beard sharp and white teeth politeness unexceptionable	1541.3873052482168
Just so Lucien returned Morcerf you have described him feature for feature	668.1564078040578
This man has often made me shudder and one day when we were viewing an execution I thought I should faint more from hearing the cold and calm manner in which he spoke of every description of torture than from the sight of the executioner and the culprit	97.01849371604378
Did he not conduct you to the ruins of the Colosseum and suck your blood asked Beauchamp	184.45184812560953
Or having delivered you make you sign a flaming parchment surrendering your soul to him as Esau did his birthright	728.9958922201266
Rail on rail on at your ease gentlemen said Morcerf somewhat piqued	606.6525728647407
When I look at you Parisians idlers on the Boulevard de Gand or the Bois de Boulogne and think of this man it seems to me we are not of the same race	101.43580461886125
I am highly flattered returned Beauchamp	471.61466382809886
At the same time added ChteauRenaud your Count of Monte Cristo is a very fine fellow always excepting his little arrangements with the Italian banditti	98.31141991256705
There are no Italian banditti said Debray	35.79087119458609
No Count of Monte Cristo added Debray	132.575486810144
There is halfpast ten striking Albert	2402.4230069162218
Confess you have dreamed this and let us sit down to breakfast continued Beauchamp	117.96607935557857
But the sound of the clock had not died away when Germain announced His excellency the Count of Monte Cristo	105.42724312665348
The involuntary start everyone gave proved how much Morcerfs narrative had impressed them and Albert himself could not wholly refrain from manifesting sudden emotion	609.2277369866435
He had not heard a carriage stop in the street or steps in the antechamber the door had itself opened noiselessly	159.15673196143226
The count appeared dressed with the greatest simplicity but the most fastidious dandy could have found nothing to cavil at in his toilet	212.50467741423273
Every article of dresshat coat gloves and bootswas from the first makers	479.9294481876395
But what struck everybody was his extreme resemblance to the portrait Debray had drawn	332.1655729042917
The count advanced smiling into the centre of the room and approached Albert who hastened towards him holding out his hand in a ceremonial manner	39.696432192642035
Punctuality said Monte Cristo is the politeness of kings according to one of your sovereigns I think but it is not the same with travellers	103.90769837189903
However I hope you will excuse the two or three seconds I am behindhand five hundred leagues are not to be accomplished without some trouble and especially in France where it seems it is forbidden to beat the postilions	115.63402141152214
My dear count replied Albert I was announcing your visit to some of my friends whom I had invited in consequence of the promise you did me the honor to make and whom I now present to you	68.8877393723107
They are the Count of ChteauRenaud whose nobility goes back to the twelve peers and whose ancestors had a place at the Round Table M	358.1038627903918
Lucien Debray private secretary to the minister of the interior M	67.55627125953733
Beauchamp an editor of a paper and the terror of the French government but of whom in spite of his national celebrity you perhaps have not heard in Italy since his paper is prohibited there and M	158.3232355072552
At this name the count who had hitherto saluted everyone with courtesy but at the same time with coldness and formality stepped a pace forward and a slight tinge of red colored his pale cheeks	190.4141630548114
You wear the uniform of the new French conquerors monsieur said he it is a handsome uniform	148.57144587301076
No one could have said what caused the counts voice to vibrate so deeply and what made his eye flash which was in general so clear lustrous and limpid when he pleased	293.28899251564803
You have never seen our Africans count said Albert	1231.0918450474053
Never replied the count who was by this time perfectly master of himself again	184.32197693560204
Well beneath this uniform beats one of the bravest and noblest hearts in the whole army	103.41663321174848
And we have just heard continued Albert of a new deed of his and so heroic a one that although I have seen him today for the first time I request you to allow me to introduce him as my friend	67.07702400396684
At these words it was still possible to observe in Monte Cristo the concentrated look changing color and slight trembling of the eyelid that show emotion	453.22074046524875
Ah you have a noble heart said the count so much the better	15.275776009826501
This exclamation which corresponded to the counts own thought rather than to what Albert was saying surprised everybody and especially Morrel who looked at Monte Cristo with wonder	104.87514686573915
But at the same time the intonation was so soft that however strange the speech might seem it was impossible to be offended at it	161.07374116321165
Why should he doubt it said Beauchamp to ChteauRenaud	58.87930496206669
In reality replied the latter who with his aristocratic glance and his knowledge of the world had penetrated at once all that was penetrable in Monte Cristo Albert has not deceived us for the count is a most singular being	91.34466622231609
Ma foi he has an open look about him that pleases me in spite of the singular remark he has made about me	87.2126346680755
Gentlemen said Albert Germain informs me that breakfast is ready	83.1461172057224
My dear count allow me to show you the way	45.587762995370156
They passed silently into the breakfastroom and everyone took his place	242.34352554603348
Gentlemen said the count seating himself permit me to make a confession which must form my excuse for any improprieties I may commit	184.2674513360436
I am a stranger and a stranger to such a degree that this is the first time I have ever been at Paris	31.107798034454767
The French way of living is utterly unknown to me and up to the present time I have followed the Eastern customs which are entirely in contrast to the Parisian	135.58509519429637
I beg you therefore to excuse if you find anything in me too Turkish too Italian or too Arabian	395.9043789959309
With what an air he says all this muttered Beauchamp decidedly he is a great man	145.520584273017
A great man in his own country added Debray	102.99942084058179
A great man in every country M	215.59258287046185
The count was it may be remembered a most temperate guest	492.35826401397935
Albert remarked this expressing his fears lest at the outset the Parisian mode of life should displease the traveller in the most essential point	450.1013376572153
My dear count said he I fear one thing and that is that the fare of the Rue du Helder is not so much to your taste as that of the Piazza di Spagna	75.64904946631212
I ought to have consulted you on the point and have had some dishes prepared expressly	216.54617698789355
Did you know me better returned the count smiling you would not give one thought of such a thing for a traveller like myself who has successively lived on macaroni at Naples polenta at Milan olla podrida at Valencia pilau at Constantinople curry in India and swallows nests in China	367.91453748854246
I eat everywhere and of everything only I eat but little and today that you reproach me with my want of appetite is my day of appetite for I have not eaten since yesterday morning	146.31972650653975
What cried all the guests you have not eaten for fourandtwenty hours	202.01716959550515
No replied the count I was forced to go out of my road to obtain some information near Nmes so that I was somewhat late and therefore I did not choose to stop	96.46114689416108
And you ate in your carriage asked Morcerf	57.10221790918845
No I slept as I generally do when I am weary without having the courage to amuse myself or when I am hungry without feeling inclined to eat	186.20520583202094
But you can sleep when you please monsieur said Morrel	29.800963912922132
You have a recipe for it	40.620669521498485
That would be invaluable to us in Africa who have not always any food to eat and rarely anything to drink	228.86772219370877
Yes said Monte Cristo but unfortunately a recipe excellent for a man like myself would be very dangerous applied to an army which might not awake when it was needed	181.88692371687378
May we inquire what is this recipe asked Debray	330.64908165963664
Oh yes returned Monte Cristo I make no secret of it	64.52853072897854
It is a mixture of excellent opium which I fetched myself from Canton in order to have it pure and the best hashish which grows in the Eastthat is between the Tigris and the Euphrates	378.4828689390673
These two ingredients are mixed in equal proportions and formed into pills	1178.4349218797697
Ten minutes after one is taken the effect is produced	367.78781411962746
Ask Baron Franz dpinay I think he tasted them one day	174.16308642441334
Yes replied Morcerf he said something about it to me	67.4980763638618
But said Beauchamp who as became a journalist was very incredulous you always carry this drug about you	578.3213520040147
Would it be an indiscretion to ask to see those precious pills continued Beauchamp hoping to take him at a disadvantage	291.99668063100984
No monsieur returned the count and he drew from his pocket a marvellous casket formed out of a single emerald and closed by a golden lid which unscrewed and gave passage to a small greenish colored pellet about the size of a pea	191.44818855466679
This ball had an acrid and penetrating odor	2692.464633935306
There were four or five more in the emerald which would contain about a dozen	240.7932644966323
The casket passed around the table but it was more to examine the admirable emerald than to see the pills that it passed from hand to hand	138.47597840122447
And is it your cook who prepares these pills asked Beauchamp	698.2497950393561
Oh no monsieur replied Monte Cristo I do not thus betray my enjoyments to the vulgar	83.01701796678529
I am a tolerable chemist and prepare my pills myself	481.43143418328634
This is a magnificent emerald and the largest I have ever seen said ChteauRenaud although my mother has some remarkable family jewels	196.6899497415308
I had three similar ones returned Monte Cristo	46.782434031857946
I gave one to the Sultan who mounted it in his sabre another to our holy father the Pope who had it set in his tiara opposite to one nearly as large though not so fine given by the Emperor Napoleon to his predecessor Pius VII	425.88854956311553
I kept the third for myself and I had it hollowed out which reduced its value but rendered it more commodious for the purpose I intended	219.69032139856859
Everyone looked at Monte Cristo with astonishment he spoke with so much simplicity that it was evident he spoke the truth or that he was mad	41.283502096328924
However the sight of the emerald made them naturally incline to the former belief	754.9516626705511
And what did these two sovereigns give you in exchange for these magnificent presents asked Debray	405.63685421612234
The Sultan the liberty of a woman replied the Count the Pope the life of a man so that once in my life I have been as powerful as if heaven had brought me into the world on the steps of a throne	63.282279313302055
And it was Peppino you saved was it not cried Morcerf it was for him that you obtained pardon	207.0866189096923
My dear count you have no idea what pleasure it gives me to hear you speak thus said Morcerf	134.75774690342394
I had announced you beforehand to my friends as an enchanter of the Arabian Nights a wizard of the Middle Ages but the Parisians are so subtle in paradoxes that they mistake for caprices of the imagination the most incontestable truths when these truths do not form a part of their daily existence	313.49807469859303
For example here is Debray who reads and Beauchamp who prints every day A member of the Jockey Club has been stopped and robbed on the Boulevard four persons have been assassinated in the Rue St	195.35719779546497
Germain ten fifteen or twenty thieves have been arrested in a caf on the Boulevard du Temple or in the Thermes de Julienand yet these same men deny the existence of the bandits in the Maremma the Campagna di Romana or the Pontine Marshes	301.10459095351825
Tell them yourself that I was taken by bandits and that without your generous intercession I should now have been sleeping in the Catacombs of St	153.7696736199595
Sebastian instead of receiving them in my humble abode in the Rue du Helder	39.21646698702319
Ah said Monte Cristo you promised me never to mention that circumstance	211.5461548663651
It was not I who made that promise cried Morcerf it must have been someone else whom you have rescued in the same manner and whom you have forgotten	88.22939932313787
Pray speak of it for I shall not only I trust relate the little I do know but also a great deal I do not know	66.53476871733392
It seems to me returned the count smiling that you played a sufficiently important part to know as well as myself what happened	155.86610296718607
Well you promise me if I tell all I know to relate in your turn all that I do not know	29.113512024852632
That is but fair replied Monte Cristo	2.143649101609514
Well said Morcerf for three days I believed myself the object of the attentions of a masque whom I took for a descendant of Tullia or Poppa while I was simply the object of the attentions of a contadina and I say contadina to avoid saying peasant girl	241.59398270850087
What I know is that like a fool a greater fool than he of whom I spoke just now I mistook for this peasant girl a young bandit of fifteen or sixteen with a beardless chin and slim waist and who just as I was about to imprint a chaste salute on his lips placed a pistol to my head and aided by seven or eight others led or rather dragged me to the Catacombs of St	205.27544976291654
Sebastian where I found a highly educated brigand chief perusing Csars Commentaries and who deigned to leave off reading to inform me that unless the next morning before six oclock four thousand piastres were paid into his account at his bankers at a quarter past six I should have ceased to exist	269.8608472447563
The letter is still to be seen for it is in Franz dpinays possession signed by me and with a postscript of M	142.40480226982174
This is all I know but I know not count how you contrived to inspire so much respect in the bandits of Rome who ordinarily have so little respect for anything	107.47587219398454
I assure you Franz and I were lost in admiration	116.39282937584635
Nothing more simple returned the count	7.33577659222965
I had known the famous Vampa for more than ten years	101.15815285409792
When he was quite a child and only a shepherd I gave him a few gold pieces for showing me my way and he in order to repay me gave me a poniard the hilt of which he had carved with his own hand and which you may have seen in my collection of arms	85.86656534931763
In after years whether he had forgotten this interchange of presents which ought to have cemented our friendship or whether he did not recollect me he sought to take me but on the contrary it was I who captured him and a dozen of his band	102.02119117098148
I might have handed him over to Roman justice which is somewhat expeditious and which would have been particularly so with him but I did nothing of the sortI suffered him and his band to depart	194.5269333160986
With the condition that they should sin no more said Beauchamp laughing	223.2055155743965
I see they kept their promise	866.3809128835085
No monsieur returned Monte Cristo upon the simple condition that they should respect myself and my friends	193.8209360279564
Perhaps what I am about to say may seem strange to you who are socialists and vaunt humanity and your duty to your neighbor but I never seek to protect a society which does not protect me and which I will even say generally occupies itself about me only to injure me and thus by giving them a low place in my esteem and preserving a neutrality towards them it is society and my neighbor who are indebted to me	166.90355169744495
Bravo cried ChteauRenaud you are the first man I ever met sufficiently courageous to preach egotism	456.259863789906
It is frank at least said Morrel	10.626670877221501
But I am sure that the count does not regret having once deviated from the principles he has so boldly avowed	280.4696960290536
How have I deviated from those principles monsieur asked Monte Cristo who could not help looking at Morrel with so much intensity that two or three times the young man had been unable to sustain that clear and piercing glance	78.22489963488823
Why it seems to me replied Morrel that in delivering M	159.62521327859199
de Morcerf whom you did not know you did good to your neighbor and to society	125.21092396318753
Of which he is the brightest ornament said Beauchamp drinking off a glass of champagne	476.87896146574695
My dear count cried Morcerf you are at faultyou one of the most formidable logicians I knowand you must see it clearly proved that instead of being an egotist you are a philanthropist	223.60476719248817
Ah you call yourself Oriental a Levantine Maltese Indian Chinese your family name is Monte Cristo Sinbad the Sailor is your baptismal appellation and yet the first day you set foot in Paris you instinctively display the greatest virtue or rather the chief defect of us eccentric Parisiansthat is you assume the vices you have not and conceal the virtues you possess	291.1185689581878
My dear vicomte returned Monte Cristo I do not see in all I have done anything that merits either from you or these gentlemen the pretended eulogies I have received	111.02353567880621
You were no stranger to me for I knew you from the time I gave up two rooms to you invited you to breakfast with me lent you one of my carriages witnessed the Carnival in your company and saw with you from a window in the Piazza del Popolo the execution that affected you so much that you nearly fainted	133.85727660107992
I will appeal to any of these gentlemen could I leave my guest in the hands of a hideous bandit as you term him Besides you know I had the idea that you could introduce me into some of the Paris salons when I came to France	104.22369450420013
You might some time ago have looked upon this resolution as a vague project but today you see it was a reality and you must submit to it under penalty of breaking your word	163.8952497024409
I will keep it returned Morcerf but I fear that you will be much disappointed accustomed as you are to picturesque events and fantastic horizons	226.76592515574785
Amongst us you will not meet with any of those episodes with which your adventurous existence has so familiarized you our Chimborazo is Mortmartre our Himalaya is Mount Valrien our Great Desert is the plain of Grenelle where they are now boring an artesian well to water the caravans	721.014307021585
We have plenty of thieves though not so many as is said but these thieves stand in far more dread of a policeman than a lord	228.22552615452182
France is so prosaic and Paris so civilized a city that you will not find in its eightyfive departmentsI say eightyfive because I do not include Corsicayou will not find then in these eightyfive departments a single hill on which there is not a telegraph or a grotto in which the commissary of police has not put up a gaslamp	250.01079449892254
There is but one service I can render you and for that I place myself entirely at your orders that is to present or make my friends present you everywhere besides you have no need of anyone to introduce youwith your name and your fortune and your talent Monte Cristo bowed with a somewhat ironical smile you can present yourself everywhere and be well received	127.26927084666167
I can be useful in one way onlyif knowledge of Parisian habits of the means of rendering yourself comfortable or of the bazaars can assist you may depend upon me to find you a fitting dwelling here	265.0998839736733
I do not dare offer to share my apartments with you as I shared yours at RomeI who do not profess egotism but am yet egotist par excellence for except myself these rooms would not hold a shadow more unless that shadow were feminine	652.0108053856844
Ah said the count that is a most conjugal reservation I recollect that at Rome you said something of a projected marriage	212.75884197770807
The affair is still in projection	284445.5589477683
And he who says in projection means already decided said Debray	2314.160556737417
No replied Morcerf my father is most anxious about it and I hope ere long to introduce you if not to my wife at least to my betrothedMademoiselle Eugnie Danglars	156.46094707758655
Eugnie Danglars said Monte Cristo tell me is not her father Baron Danglars	114.11277334579421
Yes returned Morcerf a baron of a new creation	201.32429935104565
What matter said Monte Cristo if he has rendered the State services which merit this distinction	322.43964437674833
Although in reality a Liberal he negotiated a loan of six millions for Charles X	391.16318886100413
in 1829 who made him a baron and chevalier of the Legion of Honor so that he wears the ribbon not as you would think in his waistcoatpocket but at his buttonhole	122.57427956099187
Ah interrupted Morcerf laughing Beauchamp Beauchamp keep that for the Corsaire or the Charivari but spare my future fatherinlaw before me	441.15232247989945
Then turning to Monte Cristo You just now spoke his name as if you knew the baron	68.71492072427776
I do not know him returned Monte Cristo but I shall probably soon make his acquaintance for I have a credit opened with him by the house of Richard   Blount of London Arstein   Eskeles of Vienna and Thomson   French at Rome	171.59292464540172
As he pronounced the two last names the count glanced at Maximilian Morrel	92.85111590676686
If the stranger expected to produce an effect on Morrel he was not mistakenMaximilian started as if he had been electrified	112.85929631235233
Thomson   French said he do you know this house monsieur	36.619204813821625
They are my bankers in the capital of the Christian world returned the count quietly	56.8927694061322
Can my influence with them be of any service to you	239.6103253832557
Oh count you could assist me perhaps in researches which have been up to the present fruitless	198.72506294805265
This house in past years did ours a great service and has I know not for what reason always denied having rendered us this service	289.1259425354489
I shall be at your orders said Monte Cristo bowing	39.38910603095833
But continued Morcerf   propos of Danglarswe have strangely wandered from the subject	1795.948704162043
We were speaking of a suitable habitation for the Count of Monte Cristo	33.32168669599335
Come gentlemen let us all propose some place	657.5091191746262
Where shall we lodge this new guest in our great capital	368.52631583515495
The count will find there a charming hotel with a court and garden	137.44854544429165
Bah ChteauRenaud returned Debray you only know your dull and gloomy Faubourg SaintGermain do not pay any attention to him countlive in the Chausse dAntin that s the real centre of Paris	187.0849220890133
Boulevard de lOpra said Beauchamp the second floora house with a balcony	327.9619958378903
The count will have his cushions of silver cloth brought there and as he smokes his chibouque see all Paris pass before him	553.3308341003841
You have no idea then Morrel asked ChteauRenaud you do not propose anything	31.65664870470645
Oh yes returned the young man smiling on the contrary I have one but I expected the count would be tempted by one of the brilliant proposals made him yet as he has not replied to any of them I will venture to offer him a suite of apartments in a charming hotel in the Pompadour style that my sister has inhabited for a year in the Rue Meslay	67.61051613131133
You have a sister asked the count	2.9247674638340824
Yes monsieur a most excellent sister	1108.4938115197183
As happy as it is permitted to a human creature to be replied Maximilian	214.5998581189886
She married the man she loved who remained faithful to us in our fallen fortunesEmmanuel Herbaut	591.8240193321635
I live there during my leave of absence continued Maximilian and I shall be together with my brotherinlaw Emmanuel at the disposition of the Count whenever he thinks fit to honor us	155.82802589795534
One minute cried Albert without giving Monte Cristo the time to reply	97.4625742670712
Take care you are going to immure a traveller Sinbad the Sailor a man who comes to see Paris you are going to make a patriarch of him	98.14133344136592
Oh no said Morrel my sister is fiveandtwenty my brotherinlaw is thirty they are gay young and happy	235.39293211039006
Besides the count will be in his own house and only see them when he thinks fit to do so	68.15501497027681
Thanks monsieur said Monte Cristo I shall content myself with being presented to your sister and her husband if you will do me the honor to introduce me but I can not accept the offer of anyone of these gentlemen since my habitation is already prepared	51.12853538581256
What cried Morcerf you are then going to a hotelthat will be very dull for you	107.13642027884437
Was I so badly lodged at Rome said Monte Cristo smiling	15.528745358341308
Parbleu at Rome you spent fifty thousand piastres in furnishing your apartments but I presume that you are not disposed to spend a similar sum every day	91.71602620464596
It is not that which deterred me replied Monte Cristo but as I determined to have a house to myself I sent on my valet de chambre and he ought by this time to have bought the house and furnished it	72.11281215118011
But you have then a valet de chambre who knows Paris said Beauchamp	52.36053883738943
It is the first time he has ever been in Paris	26.86575927600952
He is black and can not speak returned Monte Cristo	37.15105639630315
It is Ali cried Albert in the midst of the general surprise	28.756202765942795
Yes Ali himself my Nubian mute whom you saw I think at Rome	135.5302209463246
Certainly said Morcerf I recollect him perfectly	336.7742911285778
But how could you charge a Nubian to purchase a house and a mute to furnish ithe will do everything wrong	569.0440379619489
Undeceive yourself monsieur replied Monte Cristo I am quite sure that on the contrary he will choose everything as I wish	26.961197482010935
He knows my tastes my caprices my wants	1685.6157092908709
He has been here a week with the instinct of a hound hunting by himself	216.50457757654772
He will arrange everything for me	10.919798903346782
He knew that I should arrive today at ten oclock he was waiting for me at nine at the Barrire de Fontainebleau	86.09882502129763
He gave me this paper it contains the number of my new abode read it yourself and Monte Cristo passed a paper to Albert	133.77774570443663
Ah that is really original said Beauchamp	21.997780201757724
What do you not know your house asked Debray	79.18342875742871
No said Monte Cristo I told you I did not wish to be behind my time I dressed myself in the carriage and descended at the viscounts door	69.29559620121489
The young men looked at each other they did not know if it was a comedy Monte Cristo was playing but every word he uttered had such an air of simplicity that it was impossible to suppose what he said was falsebesides why should he tell a falsehood	88.30135553027255
We must content ourselves then said Beauchamp with rendering the count all the little services in our power	76.97396405853299
I in my quality of journalist open all the theatres to him	621.3178712776162
Thanks monsieur returned Monte Cristo my steward has orders to take a box at each theatre	210.27192832073646
Is your steward also a Nubian asked Debray	472.46488884744355
No he is a countryman of yours if a Corsican is a countryman of anyones	329.3665403716111
Bertuccio who understands hiring windows so well	60.44521993455592
Yes you saw him the day I had the honor of receiving you he has been a soldier a smugglerin fact everything	86.81676592820921
I would not be quite sure that he has not been mixed up with the police for some triflea stab with a knife for instance	107.68243909847916
And you have chosen this honest citizen for your steward said Debray	337.74787486906337
Of how much does he rob you every year	390.9429181397783
On my word replied the count not more than another	53.70745496978899
I am sure he answers my purpose knows no impossibility and so I keep him	372.06791136143875
Then continued ChteauRenaud since you have an establishment a steward and a hotel in the Champslyses you only want a mistress	147.22079255691742
He thought of the fair Greek he had seen in the counts box at the Argentina and Valle theatres	168.01528612437843
I have something better than that said Monte Cristo I have a slave	21.67716153283184
You procure your mistresses from the opera the Vaudeville or the Varits I purchased mine at Constantinople it cost me more but I have nothing to fear	139.63975652520804
But you forget replied Debray laughing that we are Franks by name and franks by nature as King Charles said and that the moment she puts her foot in France your slave becomes free	240.1456307656659
The first person who sees her	25.292848275738443
But at least we shall see her said Beauchamp or do you keep eunuchs as well as mutes	188.94874577103133
Oh no replied Monte Cristo I do not carry brutalism so far	104.01425364934914
Everyone who surrounds me is free to quit me and when they leave me will no longer have any need of me or anyone else it is for that reason perhaps that they do not quit me	56.45125406440826
They had long since passed to dessert and cigars	628.6041777730246
My dear Albert said Debray rising it is halfpast two	150.4346436615514
Your guest is charming but you leave the best company to go into the worst sometimes	172.1339081061918
I must return to the ministers	3250.738554184055
I will tell him of the count and we shall soon know who he is	41.41501884256811
Take care returned Albert no one has been able to accomplish that	16.493424738377183
Oh we have three millions for our police it is true they are almost always spent beforehand but no matter we shall still have fifty thousand francs to spend for this purpose	83.63776074933286
And when you know will you tell me	16.60022483354626
As he left the room Debray called out loudly My carriage	351.6254514033463
Bravo said Beauchamp to Albert I shall not go to the Chamber but I have something better to offer my readers than a speech of M	42.916362406534176
For heavens sake Beauchamp returned Morcerf do not deprive me of the merit of introducing him everywhere	83.3426398568086
He is more than that replied ChteauRenaud he is one of the most extraordinary men I ever saw in my life	46.357375749088924
Directly I have given my card to the count who has promised to pay us a visit at Rue Meslay No	38.22783371286321
Be sure I shall not fail to do so returned the count bowing	43.79593873467805
And Maximilian Morrel left the room with the Baron de ChteauRenaud leaving Monte Cristo alone with Morcerf	51.299214454770485
When Albert found himself alone with Monte Cristo My dear count said he allow me to commence my services as cicerone by showing you a specimen of a bachelors apartment	132.1549079236851
You who are accustomed to the palaces of Italy can amuse yourself by calculating in how many square feet a young man who is not the worst lodged in Paris can live	241.42648585384381
As we pass from one room to another I will open the windows to let you breathe	102.98007892259228
Monte Cristo had already seen the breakfastroom and the salon on the ground floor	62.53828673475125
Albert led him first to his atelier which was as we have said his favorite apartment	164.9621663276704
Monte Cristo quickly appreciated all that Albert had collected hereold cabinets Japanese porcelain Oriental stuffs Venetian glass arms from all parts of the worldeverything was familiar to him and at the first glance he recognized their date their country and their origin	399.1813017336736
Morcerf had expected he should be the guide on the contrary it was he who under the counts guidance followed a course of archology mineralogy and natural history	229.02763057617116
They descended to the first floor Albert led his guest into the salon	137.05921953064703
The salon was filled with the works of modern artists there were landscapes by Dupr with their long reeds and tall trees their lowing oxen and marvellous skies Delacroixs Arabian cavaliers with their long white burnouses their shining belts their damasked arms their horses who tore each other with their teeth while their riders contended fiercely with their maces aquarelles of Boulanger representing Notre Dame de Paris with that vigor that makes the artist the rival of the poet there were paintings by Diaz who makes his flowers more beautiful than flowers his suns more brilliant than the sun designs by Decamp as vividly colored as those of Salvator Rosa but more poetic pastels by Giraud and Mller representing children like angels and women with the features of a virgin sketches torn from the album of Dauzats Travels in the East that had been made in a few seconds on the saddle of a camel or beneath the dome of a mosquein a word all that modern art can give in exchange and as recompense for the art lost and gone with ages long since past	432.23708214955406
Albert expected to have something new this time to show to the traveller but to his great surprise the latter without seeking for the signatures many of which indeed were only initials named instantly the author of every picture in such a manner that it was easy to see that each name was not only known to him but that each style associated with it had been appreciated and studied by him	146.19669569028224
From the salon they passed into the bedchamber it was a model of taste and simple elegance	158.4242652791527
A single portrait signed by Lopold Robert shone in its carved and gilded frame	521.9760395917193
This portrait attracted the Count of Monte Cristos attention for he made three rapid steps in the chamber and stopped suddenly before it	73.45727602775055
It was the portrait of a young woman of five or sixandtwenty with a dark complexion and light and lustrous eyes veiled beneath long lashes	174.49751452690924
She wore the picturesque costume of the Catalan fisherwomen a red and black bodice and golden pins in her hair	188.23922494248515
She was looking at the sea and her form was outlined on the blue ocean and sky	208.84061136931726
The light was so faint in the room that Albert did not perceive the pallor that spread itself over the counts visage or the nervous heaving of his chest and shoulders	111.15081516166168
Silence prevailed for an instant during which Monte Cristo gazed intently on the picture	78.88642070333904
You have there a most charming mistress viscount said the count in a perfectly calm tone and this costumea ball costume doubtlessbecomes her admirably	340.0679179129012
Ah monsieur returned Albert I would never forgive you this mistake if you had seen another picture beside this	198.96303035184494
You do not know my mother she it is whom you see here	84.75402913449798
She had her portrait painted thus six or eight years ago	131.19532048140505
This costume is a fancy one it appears and the resemblance is so great that I think I still see my mother the same as she was in 1830	121.80819033999884
The countess had this portrait painted during the counts absence	372.6325349123058
She doubtless intended giving him an agreeable surprise but strange to say this portrait seemed to displease my father and the value of the picture which is as you see one of the best works of Lopold Robert could not overcome his dislike to it	121.28516537812621
It is true between ourselves that M	48.313374885019414
de Morcerf is one of the most assiduous peers at the Luxembourg a general renowned for theory but a most mediocre amateur of art	915.4492365110946
It is different with my mother who paints exceedingly well and who unwilling to part with so valuable a picture gave it to me to put here where it would be less likely to displease M	145.11684718243973
de Morcerf whose portrait by Gros I will also show you	769.3147649387032
Excuse my talking of family matters but as I shall have the honor of introducing you to the count I tell you this to prevent you making any allusions to this picture	67.28318730311133
The picture seems to have a malign influence for my mother rarely comes here without looking at it and still more rarely does she look at it without weeping	215.79164048678257
This disagreement is the only one that has ever taken place between the count and countess who are still as much united although married more than twenty years as on the first day of their wedding	90.53128307419621
Monte Cristo glanced rapidly at Albert as if to seek a hidden meaning in his words but it was evident the young man uttered them in the simplicity of his heart	42.2718365289224
Now said Albert that you have seen all my treasures allow me to offer them to you unworthy as they are	53.215288082135224
Consider yourself as in your own house and to put yourself still more at your ease pray accompany me to the apartments of M	98.57320866979717
de Morcerf he whom I wrote from Rome an account of the services you rendered me and to whom I announced your promised visit and I may say that both the count and countess anxiously desire to thank you in person	160.80900234756166
You are somewhat blas I know and family scenes have not much effect on Sinbad the Sailor who has seen so many others	168.15816644600108
However accept what I propose to you as an initiation into Parisian lifea life of politeness visiting and introductions	827.0627672141276
Monte Cristo bowed without making any answer he accepted the offer without enthusiasm and without regret as one of those conventions of society which every gentleman looks upon as a duty	198.80966351844702
Albert summoned his servant and ordered him to acquaint M	65.60317699157483
and Madame de Morcerf of the arrival of the Count of Monte Cristo	6.6161474825704625
Albert followed him with the count	37.18681119661381
When they arrived at the antechamber above the door was visible a shield which by its rich ornaments and its harmony with the rest of the furniture indicated the importance the owner attached to this blazon	195.8438944395186
Monte Cristo stopped and examined it attentively	211.8467159369185
Azure seven merlets or placed bender said he	745.1425467523943
These are doubtless your family arms Except the knowledge of blazons that enables me to decipher them I am very ignorant of heraldryI a count of a fresh creation fabricated in Tuscany by the aid of a commandery of St	245.9845660159883
Stephen and who would not have taken the trouble had I not been told that when you travel much it is necessary	96.01969675473941
Besides you must have something on the panels of your carriage to escape being searched by the customhouse officers	205.86404822554525
Excuse my putting such a question to you	45.11060293433818
It is not indiscreet returned Morcerf with the simplicity of conviction	97.54278282626784
These are our arms that is those of my father but they are as you see joined to another shield which has gules a silver tower which are my mothers	145.44582512600766
By her side I am Spanish but the family of Morcerf is French and I have heard one of the oldest of the south of France	63.145661760833164
Yes replied Monte Cristo these blazons prove that	986.2885044057391
Almost all the armed pilgrims that went to the Holy Land took for their arms either a cross in honor of their mission or birds of passage in sign of the long voyage they were about to undertake and which they hoped to accomplish on the wings of faith	182.9444471824985
One of your ancestors had joined the Crusades and supposing it to be only that of St	251.7442054607939
Louis that makes you mount to the thirteenth century which is tolerably ancient	378.7917325816004
It is possible said Morcerf my father has in his study a genealogical tree which will tell you all that and on which I made commentaries that would have greatly edified dHozier and Jaucourt	312.0055577886159
At present I no longer think of it and yet I must tell you that we are beginning to occupy ourselves greatly with these things under our popular government	97.53600890021055
Well then your government would do well to choose from the past something better than the things that I have noticed on your monuments and which have no heraldic meaning whatever	179.39931245455665
As for you viscount continued Monte Cristo to Morcerf you are more fortunate than the government for your arms are really beautiful and speak to the imagination	65.20651989295258
Yes you are at once from Provence and Spain that explains if the portrait you showed me be like the dark hue I so much admired on the visage of the noble Catalan	291.12249420960484
It would have required the penetration of dipus or the Sphinx to have divined the irony the count concealed beneath these words apparently uttered with the greatest politeness	286.35366839522544
Morcerf thanked him with a smile and pushed open the door above which were his arms and which as we have said opened into the salon	45.770759371654705
In the most conspicuous part of the salon was another portrait	130.3842437984569
It was that of a man from five to eightandthirty in the uniform of a general officer wearing the double epaulet of heavy bullion that indicates superior rank the ribbon of the Legion of Honor around his neck which showed he was a commander and on the right breast the star of a grand officer of the order of the Saviour and on the left that of the grand cross of Charles III	177.97774810171188
which proved that the person represented by the picture had served in the wars of Greece and Spain or what was just the same thing as regarded decorations had fulfilled some diplomatic mission in the two countries	204.2722237989282
Monte Cristo was engaged in examining this portrait with no less care than he had bestowed upon the other when another door opened and he found himself opposite to the Count of Morcerf in person	70.98965404466979
He was a man of forty to fortyfive years but he seemed at least fifty and his black moustache and eyebrows contrasted strangely with his almost white hair which was cut short in the military fashion	177.04131412549964
He was dressed in plain clothes and wore at his buttonhole the ribbons of the different orders to which he belonged	153.76913220842258
He entered with a tolerably dignified step and some little haste	319.33780672292147
Monte Cristo saw him advance towards him without making a single step	34.1237853271027
It seemed as if his feet were rooted to the ground and his eyes on the Count of Morcerf	32.72177509579235
Father said the young man I have the honor of presenting to you the Count of Monte Cristo the generous friend whom I had the good fortune to meet in the critical situation of which I have told you	29.81489662201104
You are most welcome monsieur said the Count of Morcerf saluting Monte Cristo with a smile and monsieur has rendered our house in preserving its only heir a service which insures him our eternal gratitude	148.1735407276734
As he said these words the count of Morcerf pointed to a chair while he seated himself in another opposite the window	87.1440319834936
Monte Cristo in taking the seat Morcerf offered him placed himself in such a manner as to remain concealed in the shadow of the large velvet curtains and read on the careworn and livid features of the count a whole history of secret griefs written in each wrinkle time had planted there	163.13477256360903
The countess said Morcerf was at her toilet when she was informed of the visit she was about to receive	61.895467826016116
She will however be in the salon in ten minutes	44.462449411908615
It is a great honor to me returned Monte Cristo to be thus on the first day of my arrival in Paris brought in contact with a man whose merit equals his reputation and to whom fortune has for once been equitable but has she not still on the plains of Mitidja or in the mountains of Atlas a marshals staff to offer you	170.48720928912653
Oh replied Morcerf reddening slightly I have left the service monsieur	76.65684159409878
Made a peer at the Restoration I served through the first campaign under the orders of Marshal Bourmont	679.0261733156793
I could therefore expect a higher rank and who knows what might have happened had the elder branch remained on the throne But the Revolution of July was it seems sufficiently glorious to allow itself to be ungrateful and it was so for all services that did not date from the imperial period	223.05572428022782
I tendered my resignation for when you have gained your epaulets on the battlefield you do not know how to manuvre on the slippery grounds of the salons	109.75381872097041
I have hung up my sword and cast myself into politics	144.46801367279897
I have devoted myself to industry I study the useful arts	2772.5842231191787
During the twenty years I served I often wished to do so but I had not the time	64.59685527151024
These are the ideas that render your nation superior to any other returned Monte Cristo	191.4228100304974
A gentleman of high birth possessor of an ample fortune you have consented to gain your promotion as an obscure soldier step by stepthis is uncommon then become general peer of France commander of the Legion of Honor you consent to again commence a second apprenticeship without any other hope or any other desire than that of one day becoming useful to your fellowcreatures this indeed is praiseworthynay more it is sublime	254.61951220039123
Albert looked on and listened with astonishment he was not used to see Monte Cristo give vent to such bursts of enthusiasm	82.16036793940793
Alas continued the stranger doubtless to dispel the slight cloud that covered Morcerfs brow we do not act thus in Italy we grow according to our race and our species and we pursue the same lines and often the same uselessness all our lives	216.69828693686318
But monsieur said the Count of Morcerf for a man of your merit Italy is not a country and France opens her arms to receive you respond to her call	106.67762999269466
France will not perhaps be always ungrateful	2623.355621810669
She treats her children ill but she always welcomes strangers	553.5021731875544
Ah father said Albert with a smile it is evident you do not know the Count of Monte Cristo he despises all honors and contents himself with those written on his passport	58.30079548716667
That is the most just remark replied the stranger I ever heard made concerning myself	305.4703281180673
You have been free to choose your career observed the Count of Morcerf with a sigh and you have chosen the path strewed with flowers	90.82787691340961
Precisely monsieur replied Monte Cristo with one of those smiles that a painter could never represent or a physiologist analyze	368.92735995151133
If I did not fear to fatigue you said the general evidently charmed with the counts manners I would have taken you to the Chamber there is a debate very curious to those who are strangers to our modern senators	133.77898052053092
I shall be most grateful monsieur if you will at some future time renew your offer but I have been flattered with the hope of being introduced to the countess and I will therefore wait	91.66909523483655
Ah here is my mother cried the viscount	49.819421929774805
Monte Cristo turned round hastily and saw Madame de Morcerf at the entrance of the salon at the door opposite to that by which her husband had entered pale and motionless when Monte Cristo turned round she let fall her arm which for some unknown reason had been resting on the gilded doorpost	53.11205528777988
She had been there some moments and had heard the last words of the visitor	42.96879102078118
The latter rose and bowed to the countess who inclined herself without speaking	96.85882834857617
Ah good heavens madame said the count are you ill or is it the heat of the room that affects you	71.63741108117708
Are you ill mother cried the viscount springing towards her	74.60835673519443
She thanked them both with a smile	8.837969195808382
No returned she but I feel some emotion on seeing for the first time the man without whose intervention we should have been in tears and desolation	126.59736658570871
Monsieur continued the countess advancing with the majesty of a queen I owe to you the life of my son and for this I bless you	56.11728636957142
Now I thank you for the pleasure you give me in thus affording me the opportunity of thanking you as I have blessed you from the bottom of my heart	62.2372709649261
The count bowed again but lower than before he was even paler than Mercds	203.08239678752068
Madame said he the count and yourself recompense too generously a simple action	1672.1905993125745
To save a man to spare a fathers feelings or a mothers sensibility is not to do a good action but a simple deed of humanity	146.45899197980046
At these words uttered with the most exquisite sweetness and politeness Madame de Morcerf replied	104.32427399894038
It is very fortunate for my son monsieur that he found such a friend and I thank God that things are thus	91.49572688605441
And Mercds raised her fine eyes to heaven with so fervent an expression of gratitude that the count fancied he saw tears in them	67.86691334420946
I have already made my excuses to the count for quitting him and I pray you to do so also	57.92514111158354
The sitting commences at two it is now three and I am to speak	67.80088255851147
Go then and monsieur and I will strive our best to forget your absence replied the countess with the same tone of deep feeling	59.786684668605204
Monsieur continued she turning to Monte Cristo will you do us the honor of passing the rest of the day with us	39.84997643301862
Believe me madame I feel most grateful for your kindness but I got out of my travelling carriage at your door this morning and I am ignorant how I am installed in Paris which I scarcely know this is but a trifling inquietude I know but one that may be appreciated	101.43238889002279
We shall have the pleasure another time said the countess you promise that	147.6759916087854
Monte Cristo inclined himself without answering but the gesture might pass for assent	294.4314989354217
I will not detain you monsieur continued the countess I would not have our gratitude become indiscreet or importunate	313.23788628781756
My dear Count said Albert I will endeavor to return your politeness at Rome and place my coup at your disposal until your own be ready	99.43532935321113
A thousand thanks for your kindness viscount returned the Count of Monte Cristo but I suppose that M	35.450733152752115
Bertuccio has suitably employed the four hours and a half I have given him and that I shall find a carriage of some sort ready at the door	57.65968298571114
Albert was used to the counts manner of proceeding he knew that like Nero he was in search of the impossible and nothing astonished him but wishing to judge with his own eyes how far the counts orders had been executed he accompanied him to the door of the house	92.73012795724682
As soon as he appeared in the Count of Morcerfs antechamber a footman the same who at Rome had brought the counts card to the two young men and announced his visit sprang into the vestibule and when he arrived at the door the illustrious traveller found his carriage awaiting him	121.52253905422377
It was a coup of Kollers building and with horses and harness for which Drake had to the knowledge of all the lions of Paris refused on the previous day seven hundred guineas	351.21369116258614
Monsieur said the count to Albert I do not ask you to accompany me to my house as I can only show you a habitation fitted up in a hurry and I have as you know a reputation to keep up as regards not being taken by surprise	87.35700271827784
Give me therefore one more day before I invite you I shall then be certain not to fail in my hospitality	83.64272892466275
If you ask me for a day count I know what to anticipate it will not be a house I shall see but a palace	79.59688731347693
You have decidedly some genius at your control	437.2779824592207
Ma foi spread that idea replied the Count of Monte Cristo putting his foot on the velvetlined steps of his splendid carriage and that will be worth something to me among the ladies	56.51504671299251
As he spoke he sprang into the vehicle the door was closed but not so rapidly that Monte Cristo failed to perceive the almost imperceptible movement which stirred the curtains of the apartment in which he had left Madame de Morcerf	45.22962055470983
When Albert returned to his mother he found her in the boudoir reclining in a large velvet armchair the whole room so obscure that only the shining spangle fastened here and there to the drapery and the angles of the gilded frames of the pictures showed with some degree of brightness in the gloom	189.6302201359315
Albert could not see the face of the countess as it was covered with a thin veil she had put on her head and which fell over her features in misty folds but it seemed to him as though her voice had altered	70.75866573393485
He could distinguish amid the perfumes of the roses and heliotropes in the flowerstands the sharp and fragrant odor of volatile salts and he noticed in one of the chased cups on the mantlepiece the countesss smellingbottle taken from its shagreen case and exclaimed in a tone of uneasiness as he entered	279.37520321355447
My dear mother have you been ill during my absence	97.90531379842928
No no Albert but you know these roses tuberoses and orangeflowers throw out at first before one is used to them such violent perfumes	602.3067659072083
Then my dear mother said Albert putting his hand to the bell they must be taken into the antechamber	32.25990620439852
You are really ill and just now were so pale as you came into the room	46.23804724665055
Yes a pallor that suits you admirably mother but which did not the less alarm my father and myself	92.39663991528991
Did your father speak of it inquired Mercds eagerly	276.45688427487187
No madame but do you not remember that he spoke of the fact to you	35.40635776892421
Yes I do remember replied the countess	25.810611567372586
A servant entered summoned by Alberts ring of the bell	207.57485855402447
Take these flowers into the anteroom or dressingroom said the viscount they make the countess ill	358.56765464510687
A long pause ensued which lasted until all the flowers were removed	239.56871021473418
What is this name of Monte Cristo inquired the countess when the servant had taken away the last vase of flowers is it a family name or the name of the estate or a simple title	61.68221766181138
I believe mother it is merely a title	264.100351909856
The count purchased an island in the Tuscan archipelago and as he told you today has founded a commandery	233.81103028923084
You know the same thing was done for Saint Stephen of Florence Saint George Constantinian of Parma and even for the Order of Malta	537.1949792638404
Except this he has no pretension to nobility and calls himself a chance count although the general opinion at Rome is that the count is a man of very high distinction	189.47514603994404
His manners are admirable said the countess at least as far as I could judge in the few minutes he remained here	45.925782459166165
They are perfect mother so perfect that they surpass by far all I have known in the leading aristocracy of the three proudest nobilities of Europethe English the Spanish and the German	361.4725410067198
The countess paused a moment then after a slight hesitation she resumed	92.41950971238991
You have seen my dear AlbertI ask the question as a motheryou have seen M	479.83835073378617
de Monte Cristo in his house you are quicksighted have much knowledge of the world more tact than is usual at your age do you think the count is really what he appears to be	113.6392643453081
What does he appear to be	8.9603440804216
Why you have just saida man of high distinction	275.6880155374067
I told you my dear mother he was esteemed such	621.9146223443065
But what is your own opinion Albert	662.1352290586378
I must tell you that I have not come to any decided opinion respecting him but I think him a Maltese	99.8409461501491
I do not ask you of his origin but what he is	96.53734287615183
Ah what he is that is quite another thing	129.58816560561849
I have seen so many remarkable things in him that if you would have me really say what I think I shall reply that I really do look upon him as one of Byrons heroes whom misery has marked with a fatal brand some Manfred some Lara some Werner one of those wrecks as it were of some ancient family who disinherited of their patrimony have achieved one by the force of their adventurous genius which has placed them above the laws of society	251.8542804138611
I say that Monte Cristo is an island in the midst of the Mediterranean without inhabitants or garrison the resort of smugglers of all nations and pirates of every flag	262.69853602848025
Who knows whether or not these industrious worthies do not pay to their feudal lord some dues for his protection	579.5895754067254
That is possible said the countess reflecting	2836.3425105586693
Never mind continued the young man smuggler or not you must agree mother dear as you have seen him that the Count of Monte Cristo is a remarkable man who will have the greatest success in the salons of Paris	55.42670521857235
Why this very morning in my rooms he made his entre amongst us by striking every man of us with amazement not even excepting ChteauRenaud	356.9105676119928
And what do you suppose is the counts age inquired Mercds evidently attaching great importance to this question	562.9397030683327
So youngit is impossible said Mercds replying at the same time to what Albert said as well as to her own private reflection	106.29500115728354
Three or four times he has said to me and certainly without the slightest premeditation at such a period I was five years old at another ten years old at another twelve and I induced by curiosity which kept me alive to these details have compared the dates and never found him inaccurate	183.27570838665628
The age of this singular man who is of no age is then I am certain thirtyfive	141.09183702586185
Besides mother remark how vivid his eye how ravenblack his hair and his brow though so pale is free from wrinkleshe is not only vigorous but also young	194.24169149147454
The countess bent her head as if beneath a heavy wave of bitter thoughts	126.49723681893859
And has this man displayed a friendship for you Albert she asked with a nervous shudder	146.28042356492548
I am inclined to think so	87.7715700079504
Why he pleases me in spite of Franz dpinay who tries to convince me that he is a being returned from the other world	93.62679201977424
Albert she said in a voice which was altered by emotion I have always put you on your guard against new acquaintances	127.6287996395252
Now you are a man and are able to give me advice yet I repeat to you Albert be prudent	154.42397259535318
Why my dear mother it is necessary in order to make your advice turn to account that I should know beforehand what I have to distrust	76.91994614474173
The count never plays he only drinks pure water tinged with a little sherry and is so rich that he can not without intending to laugh at me try to borrow money	276.3354263700636
What then have I to fear from him	93.80753864117817
You are right said the countess and my fears are weakness especially when directed against a man who has saved your life	111.59770672022371
How did your father receive him Albert It is necessary that we should be more than complaisant to the count	67.97479199592776
de Morcerf is sometimes occupied his business makes him reflective and he might without intending it	498.6833073232399
Nothing could be in better taste than my fathers demeanor madame said Albert nay more he seemed greatly flattered at two or three compliments which the count very skilfully and agreeably paid him with as much ease as if he had known him these thirty years	176.20991470807724
Each of these little tickling arrows must have pleased my father added Albert with a laugh	211.8050530708738
And thus they parted the best possible friends and M	229.34979500982945
de Morcerf even wished to take him to the Chamber to hear the speakers	72.2463448727963
She fell into so deep a reverie that her eyes gradually closed	81.42331664199908
The young man standing up before her gazed upon her with that filial affection which is so tender and endearing with children whose mothers are still young and handsome	167.89708733513922
Then after seeing her eyes closed and hearing her breathe gently he believed she had dropped asleep and left the apartment on tiptoe closing the door after him with the utmost precaution	100.90057513505018
This devil of a fellow he muttered shaking his head I said at the time he would create a sensation here and I measure his effect by an infallible thermometer	204.4049403036702
My mother has noticed him and he must therefore perforce be remarkable	534.9474718756413
He went down to the stables not without some slight annoyance when he remembered that the Count of Monte Cristo had laid his hands on a turnout which sent his bays down to second place in the opinion of connoisseurs	120.81877871285427
Most decidedly said he men are not equal and I must beg my father to develop this theorem in the Chamber of Peers	95.87157942746468
Meanwhile the count had arrived at his house it had taken him six minutes to perform the distance but these six minutes were sufficient to induce twenty young men who knew the price of the equipage they had been unable to purchase themselves to put their horses in a gallop in order to see the rich foreigner who could afford to give 20000 francs apiece for his horses	103.25284103022985
The house Ali had chosen and which was to serve as a town residence to Monte Cristo was situated on the right hand as you ascend the Champslyses	92.88002811840386
A thick clump of trees and shrubs rose in the centre and masked a portion of the front around this shrubbery two alleys like two arms extended right and left and formed a carriagedrive from the iron gates to a double portico on every step of which stood a porcelain vase filled with flowers	198.9493963394761
This house isolated from the rest had besides the main entrance another in the Rue de Ponthieu	237.7869412795732
Even before the coachman had hailed the concierge the massy gates rolled on their hingesthey had seen the Count coming and at Paris as everywhere else he was served with the rapidity of lightning	191.3958537275272
The coachman entered and traversed the halfcircle without slackening his speed and the gates were closed ere the wheels had ceased to sound on the gravel	193.9455108996533
The carriage stopped at the left side of the portico two men presented themselves at the carriagewindow the one was Ali who smiling with an expression of the most sincere joy seemed amply repaid by a mere look from Monte Cristo	79.43847608602914
The other bowed respectfully and offered his arm to assist the count in descending	67.97466569825403
Bertuccio said the count springing lightly up the three steps of the portico and the notary	49.10777653246255
He is in the small salon excellency returned Bertuccio	1271.680653846972
And the cards I ordered to be engraved as soon as you knew the number of the house	31.885062194475257
Your excellency it is done already	352.9408866113306
I have been myself to the best engraver of the Palais Royal who did the plate in my presence	152.08075867563
The first card struck off was taken according to your orders to the Baron Danglars Rue de la Chausse dAntin No	37.24800235999928
7 the others are on the mantlepiece of your excellencys bedroom	234.07008682835
Monte Cristo gave his hat cane and gloves to the same French footman who had called his carriage at the Count of Morcerfs and then he passed into the small salon preceded by Bertuccio who showed him the way	59.465622880402236
These are but indifferent marbles in this antechamber said Monte Cristo	36.79501692479179
I trust all this will soon be taken away	42.79333159306082
As the steward had said the notary awaited him in the small salon	64.06331595064037
He was a simplelooking lawyers clerk elevated to the extraordinary dignity of a provincial scrivener	726.3316371506193
You are the notary empowered to sell the country house that I wish to purchase monsieur asked Monte Cristo	56.208900609211014
Is the deed of sale ready	5015.055542935897
Very well and where is this house that I purchase asked the count carelessly addressing himself half to Bertuccio half to the notary	163.99359774507005
The steward made a gesture that signified I do not know	52.40345678754985
The notary looked at the count with astonishment	11.859024496973404
What said he does not the count know where the house he purchases is situated	258.1004379433249
How should I know I have arrived from Cadiz this morning	220.21710087132595
I have never before been at Paris and it is the first time I have ever even set my foot in France	39.145509768489205
Ah that is different the house you purchase is at Auteuil	125.42863134384456
At these words Bertuccio turned pale	5.973958556210246
And where is Auteuil asked the count	4.321269120976276
Close by here monsieur replied the notarya little beyond Passy a charming situation in the heart of the Bois de Boulogne	162.27952757391782
So near as that said the Count but that is not in the country	38.17291688340998
What made you choose a house at the gates of Paris M	66.88762963203716
I cried the steward with a strange expression	27.652962489261625
His excellency did not charge me to purchase this house	42.09897720954247
If his excellency will recollectif he will think	100.55454226681842
Ah true observed Monte Cristo I recollect now	198.0822092772462
I read the advertisement in one of the papers and was tempted by the false title a country house	82.9661975181417
It is not yet too late cried Bertuccio eagerly and if your excellency will intrust me with the commission I will find you a better at Enghien at FontenayauxRoses or at Bellevue	152.6283818453413
Oh no returned Monte Cristo negligently since I have this I will keep it	145.57371225009592
And you are quite right said the notary who feared to lose his fee	75.02892578792873
It is a charming place well supplied with springwater and fine trees a comfortable habitation although abandoned for a long time without reckoning the furniture which although old is yet valuable now that old things are so much sought after	494.64692424342604
I suppose the count has the tastes of the day	54.227988433307935
To be sure returned Monte Cristo it is very convenient then	54.174478304457985
Peste let us not lose such an opportunity returned Monte Cristo	84.57871293834297
The deed if you please Mr	90181.04218849918
And he signed it rapidly after having first run his eye over that part of the deed in which were specified the situation of the house and the names of the proprietors	117.17060237539766
Bertuccio said he give fiftyfive thousand francs to monsieur	124.31590024780677
The steward left the room with a faltering step and returned with a bundle of banknotes which the notary counted like a man who never gives a receipt for money until after he is sure it is all there	78.18451281686808
And now demanded the count are all the forms complied with	314.6794210528479
They are in the hands of the concierge who takes care of the house but here is the order I have given him to install the count in his new possessions	53.89156438834173
Very well and Monte Cristo made a sign with his hand to the notary which said I have no further need of you you may go	44.25752460293258
But observed the honest notary the count is I think mistaken it is only fifty thousand francs everything included	81.0509475904878
But have you not come from Auteuil here	204.6285200935935
Well then it is but fair that you should be paid for your loss of time and trouble said the count and he made a gesture of polite dismissal	86.65076499343365
The notary left the room backwards and bowing down to the ground it was the first time he had ever met a similar client	69.94808354947688
See this gentleman out said the count to Bertuccio	31.512792435328933
And the steward followed the notary out of the room	19.989155930789586
Scarcely was the count alone when he drew from his pocket a book closed with a lock and opened it with a key which he wore round his neck and which never left him	48.95911695222454
After having sought for a few minutes he stopped at a leaf which had several notes and compared them with the deed of sale which lay on the table and recalling his souvenirs	104.12235019581641
Auteuil Rue de la Fontaine No	8.225981813255876
28 it is indeed the same said he and now am I to rely upon an avowal extorted by religious or physical terror However in an hour I shall know all	153.41005694377913
Bertuccio cried he striking a light hammer with a pliant handle on a small gong	306.6061469237274
The steward appeared at the door	3.045718603511765
Monsieur Bertuccio said the count did you never tell me that you had travelled in France	42.05175046266633
In some parts of Franceyes excellency	16331.101641532441
You know the environs of Paris then	142.42113315129293
No excellency no returned the steward with a sort of nervous trembling which Monte Cristo a connoisseur in all emotions rightly attributed to great disquietude	411.49206130745966
It is unfortunate returned he that you have never visited the environs for I wish to see my new property this evening and had you gone with me you could have given me some useful information	83.01015547853216
To Auteuil cried Bertuccio whose copper complexion became lividI go to Auteuil	2045.4051479809093
Well what is there surprising in that When I live at Auteuil you must come there as you belong to my service	102.10077921774909
Bertuccio hung down his head before the imperious look of his master and remained motionless without making any answer	60.26291858548578
Why what has happened to youare you going to make me ring a second time for the carriage asked Monte Cristo in the same tone that Louis XIV	58.72888216363054
pronounced the famous I have been almost obliged to wait	95.0333839862109
Bertuccio made but one bound to the antechamber and cried in a hoarse voice	35.88781446352693
Monte Cristo wrote two or three notes and as he sealed the last the steward appeared	96.65960088944196
Your excellencys carriage is at the door said he	12.279407380806333
Well take your hat and gloves returned Monte Cristo	19.132465181682917
Am I to accompany you your excellency cried Bertuccio	157.7222915791754
Certainly you must give the orders for I intend residing at the house	149.85873983457637
It was unexampled for a servant of the counts to dare to dispute an order of his so the steward without saying a word followed his master who got into the carriage and signed to him to follow which he did taking his place respectfully on the front seat	121.88440918054815
Monte Cristo noticed as they descended the staircase that Bertuccio signed himself in the Corsican manner that is had formed the sign of the cross in the air with his thumb and as he seated himself in the carriage muttered a short prayer	108.47588419062359
Anyone but a man of exhaustless thirst for knowledge would have had pity on seeing the stewards extraordinary repugnance for the counts projected drive without the walls but the count was too curious to let Bertuccio off from this little journey	294.2016460879175
In twenty minutes they were at Auteuil the stewards emotion had continued to augment as they entered the village	378.9838679242717
Bertuccio crouched in the corner of the carriage began to examine with a feverish anxiety every house they passed	79.49477352221038
Tell them to stop at Rue de la Fontaine No	31.915513395852646
28 said the count fixing his eyes on the steward to whom he gave this order	35.254657898779556
Bertuccios forehead was covered with perspiration however he obeyed and leaning out of the window he cried to the coachmanRue de la Fontaine No	126.09578824700844
28 was situated at the extremity of the village during the drive night had set in and darkness gave the surroundings the artificial appearance of a scene on the stage	199.565351683935
The carriage stopped the footman sprang off the box and opened the door	18.95197244796452
Well said the count you do not get out M	32.49307595254729
Bertuccioyou are going to stay in the carriage then What are you thinking of this evening	48.28600086984731
Bertuccio sprang out and offered his shoulder to the count who this time leaned upon it as he descended the three steps of the carriage	45.493228832760586
Knock said the count and announce me	261.5949346585968
Bertuccio knocked the door opened and the concierge appeared	24.106822547006935
It is your new master my good fellow said the footman	52.221960524233594
And he held out to the concierge the notarys order	1024.030879344243
The house is sold then demanded the concierge and this gentleman is coming to live here	82.46326484567231
Yes my friend returned the count and I will endeavor to give you no cause to regret your old master	56.83224174803193
Oh monsieur said the concierge I shall not have much cause to regret him for he came here but seldom it is five years since he was here last and he did well to sell the house for it did not bring him in anything at all	68.04395666425964
What was the name of your old master said Monte Cristo	25.949276397281892
Ah I am sure he has not sold the house for what he gave for it	65.1852445311864
The Marquis of SaintMran returned the count	13.783813689737576
The name is not unknown to me the Marquis of SaintMran and he appeared to meditate	66.047567765227
An old gentleman continued the concierge a staunch follower of the Bourbons he had an only daughter who married M	345.66801519770377
de Villefort who had been the kings attorney at Nmes and afterwards at Versailles	147.82763137263896
Monte Cristo glanced at Bertuccio who became whiter than the wall against which he leaned to prevent himself from falling	51.04250495186893
And is not this daughter dead demanded Monte Cristo I fancy I have heard so	70.59446750480824
Yes monsieur oneandtwenty years ago and since then we have not seen the poor marquis three times	58.341672050863025
Thanks thanks said Monte Cristo judging from the stewards utter prostration that he could not stretch the cord further without danger of breaking it	449.4613404053486
No it is unnecessary Bertuccio will show me a light	67.10238436112559
And Monte Cristo accompanied these words by the gift of two gold pieces which produced a torrent of thanks and blessings from the concierge	105.11475401459155
Ah monsieur said he after having vainly searched on the mantlepiece and the shelves I have not got any candles	323.8282583169988
Take one of the carriagelamps Bertuccio said the count and show me the apartments	78.30630536567308
The steward obeyed in silence but it was easy to see from the manner in which the hand that held the light trembled how much it cost him to obey	101.9177216997599
They went over a tolerably large ground floor a first floor consisted of a salon a bathroom and two bedrooms near one of the bedrooms they came to a winding staircase that led down to the garden	177.52685741845661
Ah here is a private staircase said the count that is convenient	55.74121442828846
Bertuccio and go first we will see where it leads to	72.65139165435589
Monsieur replied Bertuccio it leads to the garden	36.34543023848439
And pray how do you know that	12.264175547786806
It ought to do so at least	44.6515455603862
Well let us be sure of that	34.21983894584139
Bertuccio sighed and went on first the stairs did indeed lead to the garden	127.36280751476141
At the outer door the steward paused	6591.424349316939
Go on Monsieur Bertuccio said the count	2.9174242542381865
But he who was addressed stood there stupefied bewildered stunned his haggard eyes glanced around as if in search of the traces of some terrible event and with his clenched hands he seemed striving to shut out horrible recollections	196.77727985716572
No no cried Bertuccio setting down the lantern at the angle of the interior wall	76.17918270926444
No monsieur it is impossible I can go no farther	123.58249194360755
What does this mean demanded the irresistible voice of Monte Cristo	26.92035612411105
Why you must see your excellency cried the steward that this is not natural that having a house to purchase you purchase it exactly at Auteuil and that purchasing it at Auteuil this house should be No	125.57625909250625
Oh why did I not tell you all I am sure you would not have forced me to come	28.10380753307838
I hoped your house would have been some other one than this as if there was not another house at Auteuil than that of the assassination	87.56547482640154
What what cried Monte Cristo stopping suddenly what words do you utter Devil of a man Corsican that you arealways mysteries or superstitions	718.354763930929
Come take the lantern and let us visit the garden you are not afraid of ghosts with me I hope	78.56679071587241
Bertuccio raised the lantern and obeyed	2731.4193880123003
The door as it opened disclosed a gloomy sky in which the moon strove vainly to struggle through a sea of clouds that covered her with billows of vapor which she illumined for an instant only to sink into obscurity	196.38264918402785
The steward wished to turn to the left	30.53909356889035
No no monsieur said Monte Cristo	1.0001345872926688
What is the use of following the alleys Here is a beautiful lawn let us go on straight forwards	283.43402977894164
Bertuccio wiped the perspiration from his brow but obeyed however he continued to take the left hand	74.3533933829628
Monte Cristo on the contrary took the right hand arrived near a clump of trees he stopped	98.85430950206104
The steward could not restrain himself	12.151814316597765
Move monsieurmove away I entreat you you are exactly in the spot	50.96025165104711
My dear Monsieur Bertuccio said Monte Cristo laughing control yourself we are not at Sartne or at Corte	335.94271847328514
This is not a Corsican maquis but an English garden badly kept I own but still you must not calumniate it for that	435.3589291580512
Monsieur I implore you do not stay there	35.33345832467733
I think you are going mad Bertuccio said the count coldly	45.27594338655099
If that is the case I warn you I shall have you put in a lunatic asylum	84.85016190656958
Alas excellency returned Bertuccio joining his hands and shaking his head in a manner that would have excited the counts laughter had not thoughts of a superior interest occupied him and rendered him attentive to the least revelation of this timorous conscience	120.30697484617897
Alas excellency the evil has arrived	199.50709510026257
Bertuccio said the count I am very glad to tell you that while you gesticulate you wring your hands and roll your eyes like a man possessed by a devil who will not leave him and I have always observed that the devil most obstinate to be expelled is a secret	96.33144874822781
I knew you were a Corsican	550.098163131835
I knew you were gloomy and always brooding over some old history of the vendetta and I overlooked that in Italy because in Italy those things are thought nothing of	245.37483020183015
But in France they are considered in very bad taste there are gendarmes who occupy themselves with such affairs judges who condemn and scaffolds which avenge	424.5925725847485
Bertuccio clasped his hands and as in all these evolutions he did not let fall the lantern the light showed his pale and altered countenance	137.9995503760974
Monte Cristo examined him with the same look that at Rome he had bent upon the execution of Andrea and then in a tone that made a shudder pass through the veins of the poor steward	49.16423587820974
The Abb Busoni then told me an untruth said he when after his journey in France in 1829 he sent you to me with a letter of recommendation in which he enumerated all your valuable qualities	144.62891482450388
Well I shall write to the abb I shall hold him responsible for his protgs misconduct and I shall soon know all about this assassination	138.55343311236211
Only I warn you that when I reside in a country I conform to all its code and I have no wish to put myself within the compass of the French laws for your sake	103.50657874921224
Oh do not do that excellency I have always served you faithfully cried Bertuccio in despair	228.75563989352247
I have always been an honest man and as far as lay in my power I have done good	56.729866742375954
I do not deny it returned the count but why are you thus agitated	99.40619785911173
It is a bad sign a quiet conscience does not occasion such paleness in the cheeks and such fever in the hands of a man	115.69558048955597
But your excellency replied Bertuccio hesitatingly did not the Abb Busoni who heard my confession in the prison at Nmes tell you that I had a heavy burden upon my conscience	92.33445698080487
Yes but as he said you would make an excellent steward I concluded you had stolenthat was all	266.4585618690348
Oh your excellency returned Bertuccio in deep contempt	294.33791070993385
Or as you are a Corsican that you had been unable to resist the desire of making a stiff as you call it	60.112610696422664
Yes my good master cried Bertuccio casting himself at the counts feet it was simply vengeancenothing else	357.49261242564137
I understand that but I do not understand what it is that galvanizes you in this manner	42.26085234431024
But monsieur it is very natural returned Bertuccio since it was in this house that my vengeance was accomplished	91.45836307889778
Oh your excellency it was not yours then	90.97554300694033
Whose then The Marquis de SaintMran I think the concierge said	77.07681933970396
What had you to revenge on the Marquis de SaintMran	55.39096687983322
Oh it was not on him monsieur it was on another	149.1056007822788
This is strange returned Monte Cristo seeming to yield to his reflections that you should find yourself without any preparation in a house where the event happened that causes you so much remorse	108.2585269629564
Monsieur said the steward it is fatality I am sure	50.72416326207882
First you purchase a house at Auteuilthis house is the one where I have committed an assassination you descend to the garden by the same staircase by which he descended you stop at the spot where he received the blow and two paces farther is the grave in which he had just buried his child	99.88726045507624
This is not chance for chance in this case is too much like Providence	93.0796184628678
Well amiable Corsican let us suppose it is Providence	60.197651472235
I always suppose anything people please and besides you must concede something to diseased minds	640.6349097607688
Come collect yourself and tell me all	8.04896165428448
I have related it but once and that was to the Abb Busoni	67.92434234536374
Such things continued Bertuccio shaking his head are only related under the seal of confession	89.69827131944088
Then said the count I refer you to your confessor	443.9993494502464
Turn Chartreux or Trappist and relate your secrets but as for me I do not like anyone who is alarmed by such phantasms and I do not choose that my servants should be afraid to walk in the garden of an evening	70.22465397614386
I confess I am not very desirous of a visit from the commissary of police for in Italy justice is only paid when silentin France she is paid only when she speaks	171.4891179713865
Peste I thought you somewhat Corsican a great deal smuggler and an excellent steward but I see you have other strings to your bow	302.28974877530317
You are no longer in my service Monsieur Bertuccio	142.74161190619478
Oh your excellency your excellency cried the steward struck with terror at this threat if that is the only reason I can not remain in your service I will tell all for if I quit you it will only be to go to the scaffold	54.78133450643749
That is different replied Monte Cristo but if you intend to tell an untruth reflect it were better not to speak at all	94.88033285729917
No monsieur I swear to you by my hopes of salvation I will tell you all for the Abb Busoni himself only knew a part of my secret but I pray you go away from that planetree	56.25115846715352
The moon is just bursting through the clouds and there standing where you do and wrapped in that cloak that conceals your figure you remind me of M	227.623786296899
What cried Monte Cristo it was M	49.40892650623492
The former royal attorney at Nmes	247.441974810969
Who married the Marquis of SaintMrans daughter	2630.1706787467406
Who enjoyed the reputation of being the most severe the most upright the most rigid magistrate on the bench	226.81664128963135
Well monsieur said Bertuccio this man with this spotless reputation	326.5588482935519
It is as I tell you	1.9449459901160606
And you have lost it how stupid	7882.712647059504
Yes but by careful search it might be recovered	46.86826213378384
Really returned the count relate it to me for it begins to interest me	134.8622901475597
And the count humming an air from Lucia went to sit down on a bench while Bertuccio followed him collecting his thoughts	116.9951701783431
At what point shall I begin my story your excellency asked Bertuccio	179.1340115167808
Where you please returned Monte Cristo since I know nothing at all of it	37.060796904645656
I thought the Abb Busoni had told your excellency	116.6161495041444
Some particulars doubtless but that is seven or eight years ago and I have forgotten them	49.27141049555186
Then I can speak without fear of tiring your excellency	636.3236158904987
Bertuccio you will supply the want of the evening papers	177.79539974670354
Ah said Monte Cristo 1815 is not yesterday	95.42901475288784
No monsieur and yet I recollect all things as clearly as if they had happened but then	92.09817822100804
I had a brother an elder brother who was in the service of the emperor he had become lieutenant in a regiment composed entirely of Corsicans	128.09828640560858
This brother was my only friend we became orphansI at five he at eighteen	662.1528751307171
He brought me up as if I had been his son and in 1814 he married	41.83805303071314
When the emperor returned from the Island of Elba my brother instantly joined the army was slightly wounded at Waterloo and retired with the army beyond the Loire	145.91168231812784
But that is the history of the Hundred Days M	295.3379323221445
Bertuccio said the count unless I am mistaken it has been already written	77.35105877982654
Excuse me excellency but these details are necessary and you promised to be patient	64.37905275257941
Go on I will keep my word	11.808162948479435
One day we received a letter	193.21065506723775
I should tell you that we lived in the little village of Rogliano at the extremity of Cap Corse	247.74182353787455
This letter was from my brother	147.5683978270101
He told us that the army was disbanded and that he should return by Chteauroux ClermontFerrand Le Puy and Nmes and if I had any money he prayed me to leave it for him at Nmes with an innkeeper with whom I had dealings	145.55879714199307
In the smuggling line said Monte Cristo	1.9171091981696142
Eh your excellency Everyone must live	35.052313319611336
I loved my brother tenderly as I told your excellency and I resolved not to send the money but to take it to him myself	54.21102699811068
I left five hundred with Assunta my sisterinlaw and with the other five hundred I set off for Nmes	333.7132935729919
It was easy to do so and as I had my boat and a lading to take in at sea everything favored my project	249.57418933269665
But after we had taken in our cargo the wind became contrary so that we were four or five days without being able to enter the Rhne	88.61260508789502
At last however we succeeded and worked up to Arles	886.012621022339
I left the boat between Bellegarde and Beaucaire and took the road to Nmes	117.25329778355659
We are getting to the story now	544.8294099277048
Yes your excellency excuse me but as you will see I only tell you what is absolutely necessary	88.85299744838127
Just at this time the famous massacres took place in the south of France	122.37400753312517
Three brigands called Trestaillon Truphemy and Graffan publicly assassinated everybody whom they suspected of Bonapartism	1152.4632004192322
You have doubtless heard of these massacres your excellency	803.1002437712621
Vaguely I was far from France at that period	48.254828618368876
As I entered Nmes I literally waded in blood at every step you encountered dead bodies and bands of murderers who killed plundered and burned	991.1539339570757
At the sight of this slaughter and devastation I became terrified not for myselffor I a simple Corsican fisherman had nothing to fear on the contrary that time was most favorable for us smugglersbut for my brother a soldier of the empire returning from the army of the Loire with his uniform and his epaulets there was everything to apprehend	228.96081336878623
My misgivings had been but too true	155.4910513615689
My brother had arrived the previous evening at Nmes and at the very door of the house where he was about to demand hospitality he had been assassinated	35.89143592856966
I did all in my power to discover the murderers but no one durst tell me their names so much were they dreaded	136.71524072712307
I then thought of that French justice of which I had heard so much and which feared nothing and I went to the kings attorney	56.866819838845444
And this kings attorney was named Villefort asked Monte Cristo carelessly	49.16518572498257
Yes your excellency he came from Marseilles where he had been deputy procureur	142.6683252546868
His zeal had procured him advancement and he was said to be one of the first who had informed the government of the departure from the Island of Elba	46.24495202832637
Then said Monte Cristo you went to him	45.92996978318255
Monsieur I said my brother was assassinated yesterday in the streets of Nmes I know not by whom but it is your duty to find out	65.29080765210252
You are the representative of justice here and it is for justice to avenge those she has been unable to protect	87.53698257926241
Who was your brother asked he	37.68768925226433
A lieutenant in the Corsican battalion	43227.34967377479
A soldier of the usurper then	155.7632863370695
A soldier of the French army	66.5527077973378
Well replied he he has smitten with the sword and he has perished by the sword	95.14121560427284
You are mistaken monsieur I replied he has perished by the poniard	222.1965366227801
What do you want me to do asked the magistrate	16.422199577614744
I have already told youavenge him	85.5042395360545
How should I know who they are	109.96727214020041
Order them to be sought for	15.67707806733375
Why your brother has been involved in a quarrel and killed in a duel	118.40381768884862
All these old soldiers commit excesses which were tolerated in the time of the emperor but which are not suffered now for the people here do not like soldiers of such disorderly conduct	207.40572564920902
Monsieur I replied it is not for myself that I entreat your interferenceI should grieve for him or avenge him but my poor brother had a wife and were anything to happen to me the poor creature would perish from want for my brothers pay alone kept her	172.9349502707627
Pray try and obtain a small government pension for her	555.8148779979439
Every revolution has its catastrophes returned M	420.1767271433882
de Villefort your brother has been the victim of this	18.537101724420996
It is a misfortune and government owes nothing to his family	371.61007167031056
If we are to judge by all the vengeance that the followers of the usurper exercised on the partisans of the king when in their turn they were in power your brother would be today in all probability condemned to death	108.6987098588024
What has happened is quite natural and in conformity with the law of reprisals	131.59289202833457
What cried I do you a magistrate speak thus to me	181.8444449265028
All these Corsicans are mad on my honor replied M	38.185225115412855
de Villefort they fancy that their countryman is still emperor	1814.6221541069704
You have mistaken the time you should have told me this two months ago it is too late now	37.84826282894202
Go now at once or I shall have you put out	31.556269717296235
I looked at him an instant to see if there was anything to hope from further entreaty	137.28797614834662
But he was a man of stone	118.48521689537537
I approached him and said in a low voice Well since you know the Corsicans so well you know that they always keep their word	77.15624446152592
You think that it was a good deed to kill my brother who was a Bonapartist because you are a royalist	84.3568249362356
Well I who am a Bonapartist also declare one thing to you which is that I will kill you	84.71820178437137
From this moment I declare the vendetta against you so protect yourself as well as you can for the next time we meet your last hour has come	56.71888296457888
And before he had recovered from his surprise I opened the door and left the room	30.31478477107758
Well well said Monte Cristo such an innocent looking person as you are to do those things M	156.7755326456503
Bertuccio and to a kings attorney at that But did he know what was meant by the terrible word vendetta	141.41041131167063
He knew so well that from that moment he shut himself in his house and never went out unattended seeking me high and low	214.43404211353814
Fortunately I was so well concealed that he could not find me	26.072000449505815
Then he became alarmed and dared not stay any longer at Nmes so he solicited a change of residence and as he was in reality very influential he was nominated to Versailles	250.36730709066015
But as you know a Corsican who has sworn to avenge himself cares not for distance so his carriage fast as it went was never above half a days journey before me who followed him on foot	235.05536862273343
The most important thing was not to kill him onlyfor I had an opportunity of doing so a hundred timesbut to kill him without being discoveredat least without being arrested	173.6855909277692
I no longer belonged to myself for I had my sisterinlaw to protect and provide for	402.9198244170083
For three months I watched M	114.89290514644321
de Villefort for three months he took not a step outofdoors without my following him	615.480001374594
At length I discovered that he went mysteriously to Auteuil	444.0955633457571
I followed him thither and I saw him enter the house where we now are only instead of entering by the great door that looks into the street he came on horseback or in his carriage left the one or the other at the little inn and entered by the gate you see there	56.41821909992515
Monte Cristo made a sign with his head to show that he could discern in the darkness the door to which Bertuccio alluded	86.2779352722685
As I had nothing more to do at Versailles I went to Auteuil and gained all the information I could	74.45887446594996
If I wished to surprise him it was evident this was the spot to lie in wait for him	79.76785920128565
The house belonged as the concierge informed your excellency to M	210.91927497563333
de SaintMran lived at Marseilles so that this country house was useless to him and it was reported to be let to a young widow known only by the name of the Baroness	105.651169033283
One evening as I was looking over the wall I saw a young and handsome woman who was walking alone in that garden which was not overlooked by any windows and I guessed that she was awaiting M	94.8200740531775
When she was sufficiently near for me to distinguish her features I saw she was from eighteen to nineteen tall and very fair	200.07786006779645
As she had a loose muslin dress on and as nothing concealed her figure I saw she would ere long become a mother	341.9216215584031
A few moments after the little door was opened and a man entered	28.526733248175113
The young woman hastened to meet him	8.334815224748844
They threw themselves into each others arms embraced tenderly and returned together to the house	80.6061996155262
de Villefort I fully believed that when he went out in the night he would be forced to traverse the whole of the garden alone	56.317793119759436
And asked the count did you ever know the name of this woman	22.37298308332796
No excellency returned Bertuccio you will see that I had no time to learn it	28.168531001074157
That evening continued Bertuccio I could have killed the procureur but as I was not sufficiently acquainted with the neighborhood I was fearful of not killing him on the spot and that if his cries were overheard I might be taken so I put it off until the next occasion and in order that nothing should escape me I took a chamber looking into the street bordered by the wall of the garden	73.5153813409493
Three days after about seven oclock in the evening I saw a servant on horseback leave the house at full gallop and take the road to Svres	41.88235887575606
I concluded that he was going to Versailles and I was not deceived	60.727386106590764
Three hours later the man returned covered with dust his errand was performed and two minutes after another man on foot muffled in a mantle opened the little door of the garden which he closed after him	99.11376978418858
I descended rapidly although I had not seen Villeforts face I recognized him by the beating of my heart	84.3838398121492
I crossed the street and stopped at a post placed at the angle of the wall and by means of which I had once before looked into the garden	46.52744706870718
This time I did not content myself with looking but I took my knife out of my pocket felt that the point was sharp and sprang over the wall	95.00132172986628
My first care was to run to the door he had left the key in it taking the simple precaution of turning it twice in the lock	77.32060132981903
Nothing then preventing my escape by this means I examined the grounds	149.33071749336443
The garden was long and narrow a stretch of smooth turf extended down the middle and at the corners were clumps of trees with thick and massy foliage that made a background for the shrubs and flowers	277.09061887466294
In order to go from the door to the house or from the house to the door M	24.601326533112214
de Villefort would be obliged to pass by one of these clumps of trees	47.16560509724383
It was the end of September the wind blew violently	505.2938024200684
The faint glimpses of the pale moon hidden momentarily by masses of dark clouds that were sweeping across the sky whitened the gravel walks that led to the house but were unable to pierce the obscurity of the thick shrubberies in which a man could conceal himself without any fear of discovery	168.87715395147643
I hid myself in the one nearest to the path Villefort must take and scarcely was I there when amidst the gusts of wind I fancied I heard groans but you know or rather you do not know your excellency that he who is about to commit an assassination fancies that he hears low cries perpetually ringing in his ears	184.43625410542413
Two hours passed thus during which I imagined I heard moans repeatedly	1017.8462560246925
As the last stroke died away I saw a faint light shine through the windows of the private staircase by which we have just descended	55.76142725570614
The door opened and the man in the mantle reappeared	251.7410894160072
The terrible moment had come but I had so long been prepared for it that my heart did not fail in the least	40.67468912704329
I drew my knife from my pocket again opened it and made ready to strike	60.58936546196644
The man in the mantle advanced towards me but as he drew near I saw that he had a weapon in his hand	42.204693085824545
I was afraid not of a struggle but of a failure	247.4099132340332
When he was only a few paces from me I saw that what I had taken for a weapon was only a spade	80.34547040636613
I was still unable to divine for what reason M	446.8977949038658
de Villefort had this spade in his hands when he stopped close to the thicket where I was glanced round and began to dig a hole in the earth	46.64653170363224
I then perceived that he was hiding something under his mantle which he laid on the grass in order to dig more freely	196.98719021078998
Then I confess curiosity mingled with hatred I wished to see what Villefort was going to do there and I remained motionless holding my breath	72.2648238043981
Then an idea crossed my mind which was confirmed when I saw the procureur lift from under his mantle a box two feet long and six or eight inches deep	150.6912224365615
I let him place the box in the hole he had made then while he stamped with his feet to remove all traces of his occupation I rushed on him and plunged my knife into his breast exclaiming	112.40898766534693
I am Giovanni Bertuccio thy death for my brothers thy treasure for his widow thou seest that my vengeance is more complete than I had hoped	166.89773799804706
I know not if he heard these words I think he did not for he fell without a cry	67.42547870418647
I felt his blood gush over my face but I was intoxicated I was delirious and the blood refreshed instead of burning me	125.2209724460146
In a second I had disinterred the box then that it might not be known I had done so I filled up the hole threw the spade over the wall and rushed through the door which I doublelocked carrying off the key	94.16705058261346
Ah said Monte Cristo it seems to me this was nothing but murder and robbery	164.89144318794976
No your excellency returned Bertuccio it was a vendetta followed by restitution	487.8725375728445
And was the sum a large one	288.41545941739133
Ah I recollect replied the count did you not say something of an infant	32.33836632843129
Yes excellency I hastened to the river sat down on the bank and with my knife forced open the lock of the box	57.23886664136716
In a fine linen cloth was wrapped a newborn child	256.34611168478307
Its purple visage and its violetcolored hands showed that it had perished from suffocation but as it was not yet cold I hesitated to throw it into the water that ran at my feet	109.11260721836716
After a moment I fancied that I felt a slight pulsation of the heart and as I had been assistant at the hospital at Bastia I did what a doctor would have doneI inflated the lungs by blowing air into them and at the expiration of a quarter of an hour it began to breathe and cried feebly	151.3690977206959
In my turn I uttered a cry but a cry of joy	13.963345912288437
God has not cursed me then I cried since he permits me to save the life of a human creature in exchange for the life I have taken away	71.10865517795135
And what did you do with the child asked Monte Cristo	14.757492965655665
It was an embarrassing load for a man seeking to escape	57.6818123061203
I had not for a moment the idea of keeping it but I knew that at Paris there was an asylum where they receive such creatures	106.14754454807836
As I passed the city gates I declared that I had found the child on the road and I inquired where the asylum was the box confirmed my statement the linen proved that the infant belonged to wealthy parents the blood with which I was covered might have proceeded from the child as well as from anyone else	194.69704079133808
No objection was raised but they pointed out the asylum which was situated at the upper end of the Rue dEnfer and after having taken the precaution of cutting the linen in two pieces so that one of the two letters which marked it was on the piece wrapped around the child while the other remained in my possession I rang the bell and fled with all speed	78.42645547320303
A fortnight after I was at Rogliano and I said to Assunta	257.7393016860228
Console thyself sister Israel is dead but he is avenged	83.40004973888983
She demanded what I meant and when I had told her allGiovanni said she you should have brought this child with you we would have replaced the parents it has lost have called it Benedetto and then in consequence of this good action God would have blessed us	145.5739424227361
In reply I gave her the half of the linen I had kept in order to reclaim him if we became rich	139.12832931075312
What letters were marked on the linen said Monte Cristo	23.695463720149124
An H and an N surmounted by a barons coronet	209.19689810260968
Bertuccio you make use of heraldic terms where did you study heraldry	2213.1581565805427
In your service excellency where everything is learned	288.7848876038074
Go on I am curious to know two things	32.62746797562941
What became of this little boy for I think you told me it was a boy M	61.79569095854526
No excellency I do not recollect telling you that	249.95349102954734
I thought you did I must have been mistaken	62.00544354888389
No you were not for it was in reality a little boy	71.63378841045827
But your excellency wished to know two things what was the second	80.35999976200513
The second was the crime of which you were accused when you asked for a confessor and the Abb Busoni came to visit you at your request in the prison at Nmes	65.51666151463155
The story will be very long excellency	4267.875579111302
What matter you know I take but little sleep and I do not suppose you are very much inclined for it either	81.1817282550427
Bertuccio bowed and resumed his story	1142.2592496351951
Partly to drown the recollections of the past that haunted me partly to supply the wants of the poor widow I eagerly returned to my trade of smuggler which had become more easy since that relaxation of the laws which always follows a revolution	227.3976387854689
The southern districts were illwatched in particular in consequence of the disturbances that were perpetually breaking out in Avignon Nmes or Uzs	979.9783308838751
We profited by this respite on the part of the government to make friends everywhere	85.88372900551681
Since my brothers assassination in the streets of Nmes I had never entered the town the result was that the innkeeper with whom we were connected seeing that we would no longer come to him was forced to come to us and had established a branch to his inn on the road from Bellegarde to Beaucaire at the sign of the Pont du Gard	66.08362216406297
We had thus at AiguesMortes Martigues or Bouc a dozen places where we left our goods and where in case of necessity we concealed ourselves from the gendarmes and customhouse officers	285.7685296120631
Smuggling is a profitable trade when a certain degree of vigor and intelligence is employed as for myself brought up in the mountains I had a double motive for fearing the gendarmes and customhouse officers as my appearance before the judges would cause an inquiry and an inquiry always looks back into the past	242.40790272693297
And in my past life they might find something far more grave than the selling of smuggled cigars or barrels of brandy without a permit	340.2381187056157
So preferring death to capture I accomplished the most astonishing deeds and which more than once showed me that the too great care we take of our bodies is the only obstacle to the success of those projects which require rapid decision and vigorous and determined execution	310.47780621884357
In reality when you have once devoted your life to your enterprises you are no longer the equal of other men or rather other men are no longer your equals and whosoever has taken this resolution feels his strength and resources doubled	171.98680486374903
Bertuccio interrupted the count you have done a little of everything in your life	48.19074478564929
No no but philosophy at halfpast ten at night is somewhat late yet I have no other observation to make for what you say is correct which is more than can be said for all philosophy	116.846461448277
My journeys became more and more extensive and more productive	402.85232707247553
Assunta took care of all and our little fortune increased	320.5232983565282
One day as I was setting off on an expedition Go said she at your return I will give you a surprise	153.45428135845282
I questioned her but in vain she would tell me nothing and I departed	83.73120895706771
Our expedition lasted nearly six weeks we had been to Lucca to take in oil to Leghorn for English cottons and we ran our cargo without opposition and returned home full of joy	252.12137803333397
When I entered the house the first thing I beheld in the middle of Assuntas chamber was a cradle that might be called sumptuous compared with the rest of the furniture and in it a baby seven or eight months old	165.68615234138176
I uttered a cry of joy the only moments of sadness I had known since the assassination of the procureur were caused by the recollection that I had abandoned this child	80.3967763515258
For the assassination itself I had never felt any remorse	102.21375224222365
She had profited by my absence and furnished with the half of the linen and having written down the day and hour at which I had deposited the child at the asylum had set off for Paris and had reclaimed it	102.66645531649394
No objection was raised and the infant was given up to her	64.46211687683557
Ah I confess your excellency when I saw this poor creature sleeping peacefully in its cradle I felt my eyes filled with tears	119.11077274466271
Ah Assunta cried I you are an excellent woman and Heaven will bless you	152.76965439360413
This said Monte Cristo is less correct than your philosophyit is only faith	272.82591261085724
Alas your excellency is right replied Bertuccio and God made this infant the instrument of our punishment	260.45923095288424
Never did a perverse nature declare itself more prematurely and yet it was not owing to any fault in his bringing up	155.09571081474226
He was a most lovely child with large blue eyes of that deep color that harmonizes so well with the blond complexion only his hair which was too light gave his face a most singular expression and added to the vivacity of his look and the malice of his smile	113.12762735865948
Unfortunately there is a proverb which says that red is either altogether good or altogether bad	717.3817328323903
The proverb was but too correct as regarded Benedetto and even in his infancy he manifested the worst disposition	310.7405595145488
It is true that the indulgence of his fostermother encouraged him	549.9243573978816
This child for whom my poor sister would go to the town five or six leagues off to purchase the earliest fruits and the most tempting sweetmeats preferred to Palma grapes or Genoese preserves the chestnuts stolen from a neighbors orchard or the dried apples in his loft when he could eat as well of the nuts and apples that grew in my garden	329.3365101151113
One day when Benedetto was about five or six our neighbor Wasilio who according to the custom of the country never locked up his purse or his valuablesfor as your excellency knows there are no thieves in Corsicacomplained that he had lost a louis out of his purse we thought he must have made a mistake in counting his money but he persisted in the accuracy of his statement	140.15331635469934
One day Benedetto who had been gone from the house since morning to our great anxiety did not return until late in the evening dragging a monkey after him which he said he had found chained to the foot of a tree	120.77129180331778
For more than a month past the mischievous child who knew not what to wish for had taken it into his head to have a monkey	86.53509094738406
A boatman who had passed by Rogliano and who had several of these animals whose tricks had greatly diverted him had doubtless suggested this idea to him	284.37604303720076
Monkeys are not found in our woods chained to trees said I confess how you obtained this animal	602.064610375011
Benedetto maintained the truth of what he had said and accompanied it with details that did more honor to his imagination than to his veracity	119.62574456831348
I became angry he began to laugh I threatened to strike him and he made two steps backwards	142.7750714945573
You can not beat me said he you have no right for you are not my father	25.24026214737079
We never knew who had revealed this fatal secret which we had so carefully concealed from him however it was this answer in which the childs whole character revealed itself that almost terrified me and my arm fell without touching him	161.15456518225048
The boy triumphed and this victory rendered him so audacious that all the money of Assunta whose affection for him seemed to increase as he became more unworthy of it was spent in caprices she knew not how to contend against and follies she had not the courage to prevent	190.1751873791435
When I was at Rogliano everything went on properly but no sooner was my back turned than Benedetto became master and everything went ill	909.9944182680671
When he was only eleven he chose his companions from among the young men of eighteen or twenty the worst characters in Bastia or indeed in Corsica and they had already for some mischievous pranks been several times threatened with a prosecution	297.69927348694273
I became alarmed as any prosecution might be attended with serious consequences	481.62535019826316
I was compelled at this period to leave Corsica on an important expedition I reflected for a long time and with the hope of averting some impending misfortune I resolved that Benedetto should accompany me	211.65940939570183
I hoped that the active and laborious life of a smuggler with the severe discipline on board would have a salutary effect on his character which was now wellnigh if not quite corrupt	267.49386837079504
I spoke to Benedetto alone and proposed to him to accompany me endeavoring to tempt him by all the promises most likely to dazzle the imagination of a child of twelve	91.11133949383037
He heard me patiently and when I had finished burst out laughing	196.79369027255885
Are you mad uncle he called me by this name when he was in good humor do you think I am going to change the life I lead for your mode of existencemy agreeable indolence for the hard and precarious toil you impose on yourself exposed to the bitter frost at night and the scorching heat by day compelled to conceal yourself and when you are perceived receive a volley of bullets all to earn a paltry sum Why I have as much money as I want mother Assunta always furnishes me when I ask for it You see that I should be a fool to accept your offer	196.50978979474337
The arguments and his audacity perfectly stupefied me	1449.9246002848522
Benedetto rejoined his associates and I saw him from a distance point me out to them as a fool	142.2084774572214
Oh had he been my own son replied Bertuccio or even my nephew I would have brought him back to the right road for the knowledge that you are doing your duty gives you strength but the idea that I was striking a child whose father I had killed made it impossible for me to punish him	90.07772780451427
I gave my sister who constantly defended the unfortunate boy good advice and as she confessed that she had several times missed money to a considerable amount I showed her a safe place in which to conceal our little treasure for the future	239.15904957801098
My mind was already made up	14.454881684206976
Benedetto could read write and cipher perfectly for when the fit seized him he learned more in a day than others in a week	238.12550894590822
My intention was to enter him as a clerk in some ship and without letting him know anything of my plan to convey him some morning on board by this means his future treatment would depend upon his own conduct	135.80545554779252
I set off for France after having fixed upon the plan	71.53438751057774
Our cargo was to be landed in the Gulf of Lyons and this was a difficult thing to do because it was then the year 1829	147.5128622054243
The most perfect tranquillity was restored and the vigilance of the customhouse officers was redoubled and their strictness was increased at this time in consequence of the fair at Beaucaire	177.78583412638565
Our expedition made a favorable beginning	4079.7122513502627
We anchored our vesselwhich had a double hold where our goods were concealedamidst a number of other vessels that bordered the banks of the Rhne from Beaucaire to Arles	300.0821965538332
On our arrival we began to discharge our cargo in the night and to convey it into the town by the help of the innkeeper with whom we were connected	71.00874693897228
Whether success rendered us imprudent or whether we were betrayed I know not but one evening about five oclock our little cabinboy came breathlessly to inform us that he had seen a detachment of customhouse officers advancing in our direction	226.8209030072796
It was not their proximity that alarmed us for detachments were constantly patrolling along the banks of the Rhne but the care according to the boys account that they took to avoid being seen	260.8163459381946
In an instant we were on the alert but it was too late our vessel was surrounded and amongst the customhouse officers I observed several gendarmes and as terrified at the sight of their uniforms as I was brave at the sight of any other I sprang into the hold opened a port and dropped into the river dived and only rose at intervals to breathe until I reached a ditch that had recently been made from the Rhne to the canal that runs from Beaucaire to AiguesMortes	174.91097514925048
I was now safe for I could swim along the ditch without being seen and I reached the canal in safety	182.46984571647585
I had designedly taken this direction	2413.540005365712
I have already told your excellency of an innkeeper from Nmes who had set up a little tavern on the road from Bellegarde to Beaucaire	69.15698505589059
Yes said Monte Cristo I perfectly recollect him I think he was your colleague	318.0414201766226
Precisely answered Bertuccio but he had seven or eight years before this period sold his establishment to a tailor at Marseilles who having almost ruined himself in his old trade wished to make his fortune in another	144.72668621605112
Of course we made the same arrangements with the new landlord that we had with the old and it was of this man that I intended to ask shelter	101.44148953832747
What was his name inquired the count who seemed to become somewhat interested in Bertuccios story	158.2184764984366
Gaspard Caderousse he had married a woman from the village of Carconte and whom we did not know by any other name than that of her village	92.81247451047643
She was suffering from malarial fever and seemed dying by inches	503.2730643940576
As for her husband he was a strapping fellow of forty or fiveandforty who had more than once in time of danger given ample proof of his presence of mind and courage	149.81705257706076
And you say interrupted Monte Cristo that this took place towards the year	63.77008112947843
Ah said Monte Cristo the evening of the 3rd of June 1829	323.26488269458906
It was from Caderousse that I intended demanding shelter and as we never entered by the door that opened onto the road I resolved not to break through the rule so climbing over the gardenhedge I crept amongst the olive and wild fig trees and fearing that Caderousse might have some guest I entered a kind of shed in which I had often passed the night and which was only separated from the inn by a partition in which holes had been made in order to enable us to watch an opportunity of announcing our presence	171.42429103306134
My intention was if Caderousse was alone to acquaint him with my presence finish the meal the customhouse officers had interrupted and profit by the threatened storm to return to the Rhne and ascertain the state of our vessel and its crew	218.61090382583993
I stepped into the shed and it was fortunate I did so for at that moment Caderousse entered with a stranger	87.03893176014283
I waited patiently not to overhear what they said but because I could do nothing else besides the same thing had occurred often before	124.23531238034045
The man who was with Caderousse was evidently a stranger to the South of France he was one of those merchants who come to sell jewellery at the Beaucaire fair and who during the month the fair lasts and during which there is so great an influx of merchants and customers from all parts of Europe often have dealings to the amount of 100000 to 150000 francs	166.7727073140857
Then seeing that the room was as usual empty and only guarded by the dog he called to his wife Hello Carconte said he the worthy priest has not deceived us the diamond is real	141.82417799253705
An exclamation of joy was heard and the staircase creaked beneath a feeble step	164.267904133442
What do you say asked his wife pale as death	157.77296724647147
I say that the diamond is real and that this gentleman one of the first jewellers of Paris will give us 50000 francs for it	50.03914379958933
Only in order to satisfy himself that it really belongs to us he wishes you to relate to him as I have done already the miraculous manner in which the diamond came into our possession	87.3841884132175
In the meantime please to sit down monsieur and I will fetch you some refreshment	175.165349828751
The jeweller examined attentively the interior of the inn and the apparent poverty of the persons who were about to sell him a diamond that seemed to have come from the casket of a prince	60.558983207413526
Relate your story madame said he wishing no doubt to profit by the absence of the husband so that the latter could not influence the wifes story to see if the two recitals tallied	125.2898177203888
Oh returned she it was a gift of heaven	78.43301619512292
My husband was a great friend in 1814 or 1815 of a sailor named Edmond Dants	143.54651261613
This poor fellow whom Caderousse had forgotten had not forgotten him and at his death he bequeathed this diamond to him	108.73586559561453
But how did he obtain it asked the jeweller had he it before he was imprisoned	137.53745651658767
No monsieur but it appears that in prison he made the acquaintance of a rich Englishman and as in prison he fell sick and Dants took the same care of him as if he had been his brother the Englishman when he was set free gave this stone to Dants who less fortunate died and in his turn left it to us and charged the excellent abb who was here this morning to deliver it	99.13003853147171
The same story muttered the jeweller and improbable as it seemed at first it may be true	146.39538722029906
There s only the price we are not agreed about	135.47939094355564
How not agreed about said Caderousse	200.269034748031
I thought we agreed for the price I asked	83.23226155146875
That is replied the jeweller I offered 40000 francs	432.18378947404995
Forty thousand cried La Carconte we will not part with it for that sum	52.196816194579014
The abb told us it was worth 50000 without the setting	296.346551664192
What was the abbs name asked the indefatigable questioner	831.1861027872542
The Abb Busoni said La Carconte	2.511229098764004
An Italian from the neighborhood of Mantua I believe	224.07553211681915
Let me see this diamond again replied the jeweller the first time you are often mistaken as to the value of a stone	84.30266164880057
Caderousse took from his pocket a small case of black shagreen opened and gave it to the jeweller	82.89938295453224
At the sight of the diamond which was as large as a hazelnut La Carcontes eyes sparkled with cupidity	168.5186405495412
And what did you think of this fine story eavesdropper said Monte Cristo did you credit it	71.44394781651735
I did not look on Caderousse as a bad man and I thought him incapable of committing a crime or even a theft	178.1795470290615
That did more honor to your heart than to your experience M	111.85971535163301
Had you known this Edmond Dants of whom they spoke	46.35968463086866
No your excellency I had never heard of him before and never but once afterwards and that was from the Abb Busoni himself when I saw him in the prison at Nmes	66.66418495713685
The jeweller took the ring and drawing from his pocket a pair of steel pliers and a small set of copper scales he took the stone out of its setting and weighed it carefully	102.96100258560335
I will give you 45000 said he but not a sou more besides as that is the exact value of the stone I brought just that sum with me	147.63718956805664
Oh that s no matter replied Caderousse I will go back with you to fetch the other 5000 francs	42.73387416124626
No returned the jeweller giving back the diamond and the ring to Caderousse no it is worth no more and I am sorry I offered so much for the stone has a flaw in it which I had not seen	80.29775582658115
However I will not go back on my word and I will give 45000	73.68408302840088
At least replace the diamond in the ring said La Carconte sharply	65.85395312849487
Ah true replied the jeweller and he reset the stone	211.15836450189929
No matter observed Caderousse replacing the box in his pocket someone else will purchase it	152.29635850319772
Yes continued the jeweller but someone else will not be so easy as I am or content himself with the same story	68.66305497780968
It is not natural that a man like you should possess such a diamond	61.88230570942416
You will have to find the Abb Busoni and abbs who give diamonds worth two thousand louis are rare	219.0858463644234
The law would seize it and put you in prison if at the end of three or four months you are set at liberty the ring will be lost or a false stone worth three francs will be given you instead of a diamond worth 50000 or perhaps 55000 francs from which you must allow that one runs considerable risk in purchasing	137.72257394267442
Caderousse and his wife looked eagerly at each other	41.61673253569775
No said Caderousse we are not rich enough to lose 5000 francs	36.03330148623696
As you please my dear sir said the jeweller I had however as you see brought you the money in bright coin	137.51527977506734
And he drew from his pocket a handful of gold and held it sparkling before the dazzled eyes of the innkeeper and in the other hand he held a packet of banknotes	56.10570847332402
There was evidently a severe struggle in the mind of Caderousse it was plain that the small shagreen case which he turned over and over in his hand did not seem to him commensurate in value to the enormous sum which fascinated his gaze	112.44573503499478
What do you think of this he asked in a low voice	15.31718007087933
Let him have itlet him have it she said	101.70987864783223
If he returns to Beaucaire without the diamond he will inform against us and as he says who knows if we shall ever again see the Abb Busoniin all probability we shall never see him	129.1315250994833
Well then so I will said Caderousse so you may have the diamond for 45000 francs	121.69261674080084
But my wife wants a gold chain and I want a pair of silver buckles	131.0376996751894
The jeweller drew from his pocket a long flat box which contained several samples of the articles demanded	130.88760167096942
Here he said I am very straightforward in my dealingstake your choice	726.3254945553659
The woman selected a gold chain worth about five louis and the husband a pair of buckles worth perhaps fifteen francs	125.5628504423955
I hope you will not complain now said the jeweller	198.77650644083656
The abb told me it was worth 50000 francs muttered Caderousse	88.48273010148417
Come comegive it to me What a strange fellow you are said the jeweller taking the diamond from his hand	76.47461178561485
I give you 45000 francsthat is 2500 livres of incomea fortune such as I wish I had myself and you are not satisfied	74.57271065277732
And the fiveandforty thousand francs inquired Caderousse in a hoarse voice where are they Comelet us see them	127.48023704084405
Here they are replied the jeweller and he counted out upon the table 15000 francs in gold and 30000 francs in banknotes	85.179943502932
Wait whilst I light the lamp said La Carconte it is growing dark and there may be some mistake	100.64891814702443
In fact night had come on during this conversation and with night the storm which had been threatening for the last halfhour	79.96974921095847
The thunder growled in the distance but it was apparently not heard by the jeweller Caderousse or La Carconte absorbed as they were all three with the demon of gain	135.82124165286154
I myself felt a strange kind of fascination at the sight of all this gold and all these banknotes it seemed to me that I was in a dream and as it always happens in a dream I felt myself riveted to the spot	59.11348179810951
Caderousse counted and again counted the gold and the notes then handed them to his wife who counted and counted them again in her turn	102.5485022484443
During this time the jeweller made the diamond play and sparkle in the lamplight and the gem threw out jets of light which made him unmindful of those whichprecursors of the stormbegan to play in at the windows	263.53804722319785
Well inquired the jeweller is the cash all right	424.29263061135265
Give me the pocketbook La Carconte and find a bag somewhere	301.28854009746834
La Carconte went to a cupboard and returned with an old leathern pocketbook and a bag	243.70892001062086
From the former she took some greasy letters and put in their place the banknotes and from the bag took two or three crowns of six livres each which in all probability formed the entire fortune of the miserable couple	137.50391034648544
There said Caderousse and now although you have wronged us of perhaps 10000 francs will you have your supper with us I invite you with goodwill	166.64807064718062
Thank you replied the jeweller it must be getting late and I must return to Beaucairemy wife will be getting uneasy	167.275265010476
He drew out his watch and exclaimed Morbleu nearly nine oclockwhy I shall not get back to Beaucaire before midnight Goodnight my friends	669.6776070005521
If the Abb Busoni should by any accident return think of me	281.62997775232026
In another week you will have left Beaucaire remarked Caderousse for the fair ends in a few days	131.91312858689108
True but that makes no difference	1361.5371923208863
Write to me at Paris to M	121.46812238938918
Joannes in the Palais Royal arcade Pierre No	13142.497447823653
I will make the journey on purpose to see him if it is worth while	61.40628419821774
At this moment there was a tremendous clap of thunder accompanied by a flash of lightning so vivid that it quite eclipsed the light of the lamp	123.63478480266328
You can not think of going out in such weather as this	183.46032445584564
Oh I am not afraid of thunder said the jeweller	139.45320492402408
And then there are robbers said La Carconte	37.46124939643847
The road is never very safe during fair time	676.330733801571
Oh as to the robbers said Joannes here is something for them and he drew from his pocket a pair of small pistols loaded to the muzzle	80.78288067401496
Here said he are dogs who bark and bite at the same time they are for the two first who shall have a longing for your diamond Friend Caderousse	167.61824315896448
Caderousse and his wife again interchanged a meaning look	1967.296521262065
It seemed as though they were both inspired at the same time with some horrible thought	64.80715257447912
Well then a good journey to you said Caderousse	32.2992182966311
He then took his cane which he had placed against an old cupboard and went out	49.1810622670021
At the moment when he opened the door such a gust of wind came in that the lamp was nearly extinguished	108.59831343577896
Oh said he this is very nice weather and two leagues to go in such a storm	230.64162511821496
Yes do stay added La Carconte in a tremulous voice we will take every care of you	24.163708649091816
No I must sleep at Beaucaire	9487.506019910728
Caderousse followed him slowly to the threshold	53.38334943280762
I can see neither heaven nor earth said the jeweller who was outside the door	70.73101798079387
Do I turn to the right or to the left hand	51.13835730082512
You can not go wrongthe road is bordered by trees on both sides	153.21290086728163
Goodall right said a voice almost lost in the distance	92.46415583651711
Close the door said La Carconte I do not like open doors when it thunders	222.26808843501672
Particularly when there is money in the house eh answered Caderousse doublelocking the door	207.0003762363279
He came into the room went to the cupboard took out the bag and pocketbook and both began for the third time to count their gold and banknotes	107.1020929920548
I never saw such an expression of cupidity as the flickering lamp revealed in those two countenances	254.96213794353943
The woman especially was hideous her usual feverish tremulousness was intensified her countenance had become livid and her eyes resembled burning coals	536.5555506070101
Why she inquired in a hoarse voice did you invite him to sleep here tonight	50.48284207922747
Why said Caderousse with a shudder why that he might not have the trouble of returning to Beaucaire	71.22882069850144
Ah responded the woman with an expression impossible to describe I thought it was for something else	69.86388064779396
Woman womanwhy do you have such ideas cried Caderousse or if you have them why do nt you keep them to yourself	71.97231658148297
Well said La Carconte after a moments pause you are not a man	38.85664205227854
What do you mean added Caderousse	112.17309646372247
If you had been a man you would not have let him go from here	34.9071985103544
Or else he should not have reached Beaucaire	1130.6010845630965
The road takes a turnhe is obliged to follow itwhile alongside of the canal there is a shorter road	516.314063540385
And at this moment there was a tremendous peal of thunder while the livid lightning illumined the room and the thunder rolling away in the distance seemed to withdraw unwillingly from the cursed abode	179.66505357489345
At the same moment and in the midst of the terrifying silence which usually follows a clap of thunder they heard a knocking at the door	101.92557194446432
Caderousse and his wife started and looked aghast at each other	101.74518551495905
Who s there cried Caderousse rising and drawing up in a heap the gold and notes scattered over the table and which he covered with his two hands	98.19869893047516
It is I shouted a voice	39.33566203761194
Well and you said I offended the good God said La Carconte with a horrid smile	132.61098642506622
Why the good God sends him back again	52.12784147856046
Caderousse sank pale and breathless into his chair	21.994184393769423
La Carconte on the contrary rose and going with a firm step towards the door opened it saying as she did so	67.10258744770454
Ma foi said the jeweller drenched with rain I am not destined to return to Beaucaire tonight	168.22412520136385
The shortest follies are best my dear Caderousse	293.30279666101825
You offered me hospitality and I accept it and have returned to sleep beneath your friendly roof	162.31420996706632
Caderousse stammered out something while he wiped away the sweat that started to his brow	62.049059120102186
La Carconte doublelocked the door behind the jeweller	71.6466499209465
As the jeweller returned to the apartment he cast around him a scrutinizing glancebut there was nothing to excite suspicion if it did not exist or to confirm it if it were already awakened	134.08563433443308
Caderousses hands still grasped the gold and banknotes and La Carconte called up her sweetest smiles while welcoming the reappearance of their guest	307.6924348536266
Well well said the jeweller you seem my good friends to have had some fears respecting the accuracy of your money by counting it over so carefully directly I was gone	201.11279224896012
Oh no answered Caderousse that was not my reason I can assure you but the circumstances by which we have become possessed of this wealth are so unexpected as to make us scarcely credit our good fortune and it is only by placing the actual proof of our riches before our eyes that we can persuade ourselves that the whole affair is not a dream	89.17255369052837
Have you any other guests in your house inquired he	41.27378396611282
Nobody but ourselves replied Caderousse the fact is we do not lodge travellersindeed our tavern is so near the town that nobody would think of stopping here	295.1337321084423
Then I am afraid I shall very much inconvenience you	190.6317872373464
Inconvenience us Not at all my dear sir said La Carconte in her most gracious manner	21.111143061610644
Not at all I assure you	2.877662878339873
But where will you manage to stow me	241.36080220289074
Surely that is where you yourselves sleep	5491.5730323054095
Never mind that we have a second bed in the adjoining room	65.13139826388282
Caderousse stared at his wife with much astonishment	77.29576160301515
The jeweller meanwhile was humming a song as he stood warming his back at the fire La Carconte had kindled to dry the wet garments of her guest and this done she next occupied herself in arranging his supper by spreading a napkin at the end of the table and placing on it the slender remains of their dinner to which she added three or four freshlaid eggs	188.78240420645915
Caderousse had once more parted with his treasurethe banknotes were replaced in the pocketbook the gold put back into the bag and the whole carefully locked in the cupboard	144.74784252812117
He then began pacing the room with a pensive and gloomy air glancing from time to time at the jeweller who stood reeking with the steam from his wet clothes and merely changing his place on the warm hearth to enable the whole of his garments to be dried	173.72155329367448
There said La Carconte as she placed a bottle of wine on the table supper is ready whenever you are	56.12228010375843
I do nt want any supper said Caderousse	75.58278998945949
We dined so very late hastily interposed La Carconte	2402.036123641228
Then it seems I am to eat alone remarked the jeweller	329.34007780115786
Oh we shall have the pleasure of waiting upon you answered La Carconte with an eager attention she was not accustomed to manifest even to guests who paid for what they took	103.54684590903177
From time to time Caderousse darted on his wife keen searching glances but rapid as the lightning flash	993.9222591635074
There there said La Carconte do you hear that upon my word you did well to come back	67.19714692784538
Nevertheless replied the jeweller if by the time I have finished my supper the tempest has at all abated I shall make another start	160.78727059810254
Its the mistral said Caderousse and it will be sure to last till tomorrow morning	49.96170137879021
Well said the jeweller as he placed himself at table all I can say is so much the worse for those who are abroad	50.7546773856478
Yes chimed in La Carconte they will have a wretched night of it	93.99984920640276
The jeweller began eating his supper and the woman who was ordinarily so querulous and indifferent to all who approached her was suddenly transformed into the most smiling and attentive hostess	221.20760339707445
Had the unhappy man on whom she lavished her assiduities been previously acquainted with her so sudden an alteration might well have excited suspicion in his mind or at least have greatly astonished him	193.0366625215567
Caderousse meanwhile continued to pace the room in gloomy silence sedulously avoiding the sight of his guest but as soon as the stranger had completed his repast the agitated innkeeper went eagerly to the door and opened it	110.02261109120074
I believe the storm is over said he	114.3851852903928
But as if to contradict his statement at that instant a violent clap of thunder seemed to shake the house to its very foundation while a sudden gust of wind mingled with rain extinguished the lamp he held in his hand	121.7191513070618
Trembling and awestruck Caderousse hastily shut the door and returned to his guest while La Carconte lighted a candle by the smouldering ashes that glimmered on the hearth	126.82854666154726
You must be tired said she to the jeweller I have spread a pair of white sheets on your bed go up when you are ready and sleep well	100.93020458186984
Joannes stayed for a while to see whether the storm seemed to abate in its fury but a brief space of time sufficed to assure him that instead of diminishing the violence of the rain and thunder momentarily increased resigning himself therefore to what seemed inevitable he bade his host goodnight and mounted the stairs	235.09205412336632
He passed over my head and I heard the flooring creak beneath his footsteps	191.1322473092636
The quick eager glance of La Carconte followed him as he ascended while Caderousse on the contrary turned his back and seemed most anxiously to avoid even glancing at him	235.37984839550498
All these circumstances did not strike me as painfully at the time as they have since done in fact all that had happened with the exception of the story of the diamond which certainly did wear an air of improbability appeared natural enough and called for neither apprehension nor mistrust but worn out as I was with fatigue and fully purposing to proceed onwards directly the tempest abated I determined to obtain a few hours sleep	223.1041811412559
Overhead I could accurately distinguish every movement of the jeweller who after making the best arrangements in his power for passing a comfortable night threw himself on his bed and I could hear it creak and groan beneath his weight	86.7388015279477
Insensibly my eyelids grew heavy deep sleep stole over me and having no suspicion of anything wrong I sought not to shake it off	171.309915972995
I looked into the kitchen once more and saw Caderousse sitting by the side of a long table upon one of the low wooden stools which in country places are frequently used instead of chairs his back was turned towards me so that I could not see the expression of his countenanceneither should I have been able to do so had he been placed differently as his head was buried between his two hands	123.27087840640051
La Carconte continued to gaze on him for some time then shrugging her shoulders she took her seat immediately opposite to him	49.04265212728411
At this moment the expiring embers threw up a fresh flame from the kindling of a piece of wood that lay near and a bright light flashed over the room	123.79346605556921
La Carconte still kept her eyes fixed on her husband but as he made no sign of changing his position she extended her hard bony hand and touched him on the forehead	73.26027437664652
The womans lips seemed to move as though she were talking but because she merely spoke in an undertone or my senses were dulled by sleep I did not catch a word she uttered	118.59392358065294
Confused sights and sounds seemed to float before me and gradually I fell into a deep heavy slumber	70.01154960820045
How long I had been in this unconscious state I know not when I was suddenly aroused by the report of a pistol followed by a fearful cry	83.73095132408496
Weak and tottering footsteps resounded across the chamber above me and the next instant a dull heavy weight seemed to fall powerless on the staircase	137.6427397406666
I had not yet fully recovered consciousness when again I heard groans mingled with halfstifled cries as if from persons engaged in a deadly struggle	315.963707706043
A cry more prolonged than the others and ending in a series of groans effectually roused me from my drowsy lethargy	459.24727488410576
Hastily raising myself on one arm I looked around but all was dark and it seemed to me as if the rain must have penetrated through the flooring of the room above for some kind of moisture appeared to fall drop by drop upon my forehead and when I passed my hand across my brow I felt that it was wet and clammy	71.23380696952323
To the fearful noises that had awakened me had succeeded the most perfect silenceunbroken save by the footsteps of a man walking about in the chamber above	111.25071990261935
The staircase creaked he descended into the room below approached the fire and lit a candle	124.72130968343455
The man was Caderoussehe was pale and his shirt was all bloody	180.40784543143903
Having obtained the light he hurried upstairs again and once more I heard his rapid and uneasy footsteps	227.87040984318978
A moment later he came down again holding in his hand the small shagreen case which he opened to assure himself it contained the diamondseemed to hesitate as to which pocket he should put it in then as if dissatisfied with the security of either pocket he deposited it in his red handkerchief which he carefully rolled round his head	140.90223272305926
After this he took from his cupboard the banknotes and gold he had put there thrust the one into the pocket of his trousers and the other into that of his waistcoat hastily tied up a small bundle of linen and rushing towards the door disappeared in the darkness of the night	65.18696182295906
Then all became clear and manifest to me and I reproached myself with what had happened as though I myself had done the guilty deed	157.79617050544064
I fancied that I still heard faint moans and imagining that the unfortunate jeweller might not be quite dead I determined to go to his relief by way of atoning in some slight degree not for the crime I had committed but for that which I had not endeavored to prevent	140.24203536974105
For this purpose I applied all the strength I possessed to force an entrance from the cramped spot in which I lay to the adjoining room	110.77341778531252
The poorly fastened boards which alone divided me from it yielded to my efforts and I found myself in the house	89.06984578975485
Hastily snatching up the lighted candle I hurried to the staircase about midway a body was lying quite across the stairs	341.4828370791845
It was that of La Carconte	39.54671395734645
The pistol I had heard had doubtless been fired at her	148.98585581007112
The shot had frightfully lacerated her throat leaving two gaping wounds from which as well as the mouth the blood was pouring in floods	223.2647834144806
I strode past her and ascended to the sleeping chamber which presented an appearance of the wildest disorder	263.6003834967071
The furniture had been knocked over in the deadly struggle that had taken place there and the sheets to which the unfortunate jeweller had doubtless clung were dragged across the room	193.98408332821737
The murdered man lay on the floor his head leaning against the wall and about him was a pool of blood which poured forth from three large wounds in his breast there was a fourth gash in which a long table knife was plunged up to the handle	65.2982394566604
I stumbled over some object I stooped to examineit was the second pistol which had not gone off probably from the powder being wet	327.8342023094208
I approached the jeweller who was not quite dead and at the sound of my footsteps and the creaking of the floor he opened his eyes fixed them on me with an anxious and inquiring gaze moved his lips as though trying to speak then overcome by the effort fell back and expired	79.3465098802534
This appalling sight almost bereft me of my senses and finding that I could no longer be of service to anyone in the house my only desire was to fly	99.22360942324053
I rushed towards the staircase clutching my hair and uttering a groan of horror	112.42444131867809
Upon reaching the room below I found five or six customhouse officers and two or three gendarmesall heavily armed	300.89516329605067
I made no resistance I was no longer master of my senses	114.25318148834391
When I strove to speak a few inarticulate sounds alone escaped my lips	314.32561890224747
As I noticed the significant manner in which the whole party pointed to my bloodstained garments I involuntarily surveyed myself and then I discovered that the thick warm drops that had so bedewed me as I lay beneath the staircase must have been the blood of La Carconte	174.17437094016103
I pointed to the spot where I had concealed myself	29.04885098546543
What does he mean asked a gendarme	159.4119097796015
One of the officers went to the place I directed	105.35683276137837
He means replied the man upon his return that he got in that way and he showed the hole I had made when I broke through	105.97729139398388
Then I saw that they took me for the assassin	48.54053515336918
I recovered force and energy enough to free myself from the hands of those who held me while I managed to stammer forth	102.78932916105217
I did not do it Indeed indeed I did not	124.7582936217008
A couple of gendarmes held the muzzles of their carbines against my breast	243.37194434787807
Stir but a step said they and you are a dead man	40.5443716969361
Why should you threaten me with death cried I when I have already declared my innocence	140.95670964993914
Tush tush cried the men keep your innocent stories to tell to the judge at Nmes	345.9950584165686
Meanwhile come along with us and the best advice we can give you is to do so unresistingly	109.70611628706088
Alas resistance was far from my thoughts	125.96185260927442
I was utterly overpowered by surprise and terror and without a word I suffered myself to be handcuffed and tied to a horses tail and thus they took me to Nmes	195.230029218937
I had been tracked by a customsofficer who had lost sight of me near the tavern feeling certain that I intended to pass the night there he had returned to summon his comrades who just arrived in time to hear the report of the pistol and to take me in the midst of such circumstantial proofs of my guilt as rendered all hopes of proving my innocence utterly futile	134.77814483391919
One only chance was left me that of beseeching the magistrate before whom I was taken to cause every inquiry to be made for the Abb Busoni who had stopped at the inn of the Pont du Gard on that morning	57.71814691329252
If Caderousse had invented the story relative to the diamond and there existed no such person as the Abb Busoni then indeed I was lost past redemption or at least my life hung upon the feeble chance of Caderousse himself being apprehended and confessing the whole truth	182.91525159118817
Two months passed away in hopeless expectation on my part while I must do the magistrate the justice to say that he used every means to obtain information of the person I declared could exculpate me if he would	147.86617156104964
Caderousse still evaded all pursuit and I had resigned myself to what seemed my inevitable fate	349.2687564663443
My trial was to come on at the approaching assizes when on the 8th of Septemberthat is to say precisely three months and five days after the events which had perilled my lifethe Abb Busoni whom I never ventured to believe I should see presented himself at the prison doors saying he understood one of the prisoners wished to speak to him he added that having learned at Marseilles the particulars of my imprisonment he hastened to comply with my desire	129.09295263927532
You may easily imagine with what eagerness I welcomed him and how minutely I related the whole of what I had seen and heard	158.71943174272832
I felt some degree of nervousness as I entered upon the history of the diamond but to my inexpressible astonishment he confirmed it in every particular and to my equal surprise he seemed to place entire belief in all I said	221.48355555414767
And then it was that won by his mild charity seeing that he was acquainted with all the habits and customs of my own country and considering also that pardon for the only crime of which I was really guilty might come with a double power from lips so benevolent and kind I besought him to receive my confession under the seal of which I recounted the Auteuil affair in all its details as well as every other transaction of my life	176.10994719103678
That which I had done by the impulse of my best feelings produced the same effect as though it had been the result of calculation	67.41244674845419
My voluntary confession of the assassination at Auteuil proved to him that I had not committed that of which I stood accused	184.21091417528166
When he quitted me he bade me be of good courage and to rely upon his doing all in his power to convince my judges of my innocence	112.8068097763522
I had speedy proofs that the excellent abb was engaged in my behalf for the rigors of my imprisonment were alleviated by many trifling though acceptable indulgences and I was told that my trial was to be postponed to the assizes following those now being held	204.25042888045553
In the interim it pleased Providence to cause the apprehension of Caderousse who was discovered in some distant country and brought back to France where he made a full confession refusing to make the fact of his wifes having suggested and arranged the murder any excuse for his own guilt	155.19143651400393
The wretched man was sentenced to the galleys for life and I was immediately set at liberty	114.18532779423462
And then it was I presume said Monte Cristo that you came to me as the bearer of a letter from the Abb Busoni	26.583654926422035
It was your excellency the benevolent abb took an evident interest in all that concerned me	319.0192071228994
Your mode of life as a smuggler said he to me one day will be the ruin of you if you get out do nt take it up again	51.129947631152945
But how inquired I am I to maintain myself and my poor sister	45.99376637319576
A person whose confessor I am replied he and who entertains a high regard for me applied to me a short time since to procure him a confidential servant	153.2780531804087
Would you like such a post If so I will give you a letter of introduction to him	49.946913249622014
Oh father I exclaimed you are very good	46.25734445820846
But you must swear solemnly that I shall never have reason to repent my recommendation	83.67789103386515
I extended my hand and was about to pledge myself by any promise he would dictate but he stopped me	204.3854731606576
It is unnecessary for you to bind yourself by any vow said he I know and admire the Corsican nature too well to fear you	117.80459682367538
Here take this continued he after rapidly writing the few lines I brought to your excellency and upon receipt of which you deigned to receive me into your service and proudly I ask whether your excellency has ever had cause to repent having done so	161.745722697608
No replied the count I take pleasure in saying that you have served me faithfully Bertuccio but you might have shown more confidence in me	194.2437455889125
How comes it that having both a sister and an adopted son you have never spoken to me of either	90.94267012881673
Alas I have still to recount the most distressing period of my life	348.83798291998585
Anxious as you may suppose I was to behold and comfort my dear sister I lost no time in hastening to Corsica but when I arrived at Rogliano I found a house of mourning the consequences of a scene so horrible that the neighbors remember and speak of it to this day	133.34681646580134
Acting by my advice my poor sister had refused to comply with the unreasonable demands of Benedetto who was continually tormenting her for money as long as he believed there was a sou left in her possession	155.62352618082082
One morning he threatened her with the severest consequences if she did not supply him with what he desired and disappeared and remained away all day leaving the kindhearted Assunta who loved him as if he were her own child to weep over his conduct and bewail his absence	125.98268887209728
Evening came and still with all the patient solicitude of a mother she watched for his return	141.23684616065978
As the eleventh hour struck he entered with a swaggering air attended by two of the most dissolute and reckless of his boon companions	255.83487837500599
She stretched out her arms to him but they seized hold of her and one of the threenone other than the accursed Benedetto exclaimed	133.58151528111267
Put her to torture and shell soon tell us where her money is	395.9645561200317
It unfortunately happened that our neighbor Wasilio was at Bastia leaving no person in his house but his wife no human creature beside could hear or see anything that took place within our dwelling	307.7462248023128
Two held poor Assunta who unable to conceive that any harm was intended to her smiled in the face of those who were soon to become her executioners	99.4628280381321
The third proceeded to barricade the doors and windows then returned and the three united in stifling the cries of terror incited by the sight of these preparations and then dragged Assunta feet foremost towards the brazier expecting to wring from her an avowal of where her supposed treasure was secreted	289.20175818383876
In the struggle her clothes caught fire and they were obliged to let go their hold in order to preserve themselves from sharing the same fate	150.74738925560172
Covered with flames Assunta rushed wildly to the door but it was fastened she flew to the windows but they were also secured then the neighbors heard frightful shrieks it was Assunta calling for help	229.92740789968488
The cries died away in groans and next morning as soon as Wasilios wife could muster up courage to venture abroad she caused the door of our dwelling to be opened by the public authorities when Assunta although dreadfully burnt was found still breathing every drawer and closet in the house had been forced open and the money stolen	339.68499794561285
Benedetto never again appeared at Rogliano neither have I since that day either seen or heard anything concerning him	471.86615049321176
It was subsequently to these dreadful events that I waited on your excellency to whom it would have been folly to have mentioned Benedetto since all trace of him seemed entirely lost or of my sister since she was dead	126.24062994310628
And in what light did you view the occurrence inquired Monte Cristo	160.44839933176158
As a punishment for the crime I had committed answered Bertuccio	284.2852233206273
Oh those Villeforts are an accursed race	936.1858749753466
Truly they are murmured the count in a lugubrious tone	70.9745781195533
And now resumed Bertuccio your excellency may perhaps be able to comprehend that this place which I revisit for the first timethis garden the actual scene of my crimemust have given rise to reflections of no very agreeable nature and produced that gloom and depression of spirits which excited the notice of your excellency who was pleased to express a desire to know the cause	237.05019033257656
At this instant a shudder passes over me as I reflect that possibly I am now standing on the very grave in which lies M	181.43774332408012
de Villefort by whose hand the ground was dug to receive the corpse of his child	57.52421038625091
Everything is possible said Monte Cristo rising from the bench on which he had been sitting even he added in an inaudible voice even that the procureur be not dead	70.61178625548567
The Abb Busoni did right to send you to me he went on in his ordinary tone and you have done well in relating to me the whole of your history as it will prevent my forming any erroneous opinions concerning you in future	119.40230363199834
As for that Benedetto who so grossly belied his name have you never made any effort to trace out whither he has gone or what has become of him	201.28081154388087
No far from wishing to learn whither he has betaken himself I should shun the possibility of meeting him as I would a wild beast	196.36330329468657
Thank God I have never heard his name mentioned by any person and I hope and believe he is dead	80.92301299702109
Do not think so Bertuccio replied the count for the wicked are not so easily disposed of for God seems to have them under his special watchcare to make of them instruments of his vengeance	163.69075526661595
So be it responded Bertuccio all I ask of heaven is that I may never see him again	80.90514399814269
And now your excellency he added bowing his head you know everythingyou are my judge on earth as the Almighty is in heaven have you for me no words of consolation	158.8720963300311
My good friend I can only repeat the words addressed to you by the Abb Busoni	49.913191433845704
Villefort merited punishment for what he had done to you and perhaps to others	39.86216807075736
Benedetto if still living will become the instrument of divine retribution in some way or other and then be duly punished in his turn	148.06659047205903
As far as you yourself are concerned I see but one point in which you are really guilty	76.18859849473412
Ask yourself wherefore after rescuing the infant from its living grave you did not restore it to its mother There was the crime Bertucciothat was where you became really culpable	351.2522378403589
True excellency that was the crime the real crime for in that I acted like a coward	143.44766685620542
My first duty directly I had succeeded in recalling the babe to life was to restore it to its mother but in order to do so I must have made close and careful inquiry which would in all probability have led to my own apprehension and I clung to life partly on my sisters account and partly from that feeling of pride inborn in our hearts of desiring to come off untouched and victorious in the execution of our vengeance	181.71148984491643
Perhaps too the natural and instinctive love of life made me wish to avoid endangering my own	353.50260155953384
And then again I am not as brave and courageous as was my poor brother	101.31912382341585
Bertuccio hid his face in his hands as he uttered these words while Monte Cristo fixed on him a look of inscrutable meaning	41.272576478880104
After a brief silence rendered still more solemn by the time and place the count said in a tone of melancholy wholly unlike his usual manner	85.29467278123742
In order to bring this conversation to a fitting termination the last we shall ever hold upon this subject I will repeat to you some words I have heard from the lips of the Abb Busoni	67.7764715443954
For all evils there are two remediestime and silence	885.6027376392149
And now leave me Monsieur Bertuccio to walk alone here in the garden	71.45975769987876
The very circumstances which inflict on you as a principal in the tragic scene enacted here such painful emotions are to me on the contrary a source of something like contentment and serve but to enhance the value of this dwelling in my estimation	230.9749827318888
The chief beauty of trees consists in the deep shadow of their umbrageous boughs while fancy pictures a moving multitude of shapes and forms flitting and passing beneath that shade	720.7407321632302
Here I have a garden laid out in such a way as to afford the fullest scope for the imagination and furnished with thickly grown trees beneath whose leafy screen a visionary like myself may conjure up phantoms at will	550.5488706662885
This to me who expected but to find a blank enclosure surrounded by a straight wall is I assure you a most agreeable surprise	280.37900198459295
I have no fear of ghosts and I have never heard it said that so much harm had been done by the dead during six thousand years as is wrought by the living in a single day	70.56202826483916
Retire within Bertuccio and tranquillize your mind	113.38349490548337
Should your confessor be less indulgent to you in your dying moments than you found the Abb Busoni send for me if I am still on earth and I will soothe your ears with words that shall effectually calm and soothe your parting soul ere it goes forth to traverse the ocean called eternity	172.6052721557307
Bertuccio bowed respectfully and turned away sighing heavily	1810.4263699253836
Monte Cristo left alone took three or four steps onwards and murmured	178.67016626094542
Here beneath this planetree must have been where the infants grave was dug	362.3702805130407
There is the little door opening into the garden	45.03663958716119
At this corner is the private staircase communicating with the sleeping apartment	696.7066951284639
There will be no necessity for me to make a note of these particulars for there before my eyes beneath my feet all around me I have the plan sketched with all the living reality of truth	107.89945071838258
After making the tour of the garden a second time the count reentered his carriage while Bertuccio who perceived the thoughtful expression of his masters features took his seat beside the driver without uttering a word	73.0275705434309
The carriage proceeded rapidly towards Paris	280.15528212721483
That same evening upon reaching his abode in the Champslyses the Count of Monte Cristo went over the whole building with the air of one long acquainted with each nook or corner	83.6473729471
Nor although preceding the party did he once mistake one door for another or commit the smallest error when choosing any particular corridor or staircase to conduct him to a place or suite of rooms he desired to visit	302.33417228823026
Ali was his principal attendant during this nocturnal survey	1347.2712566558487
Having given various orders to Bertuccio relative to the improvements and alterations he desired to make in the house the Count drawing out his watch said to the attentive Nubian	241.2786930791523
It is halfpast eleven oclock Hayde will soon be here	46.5951943064989
Have the French attendants been summoned to await her coming	160.43790613519596
Ali extended his hands towards the apartments destined for the fair Greek which were so effectually concealed by means of a tapestried entrance that it would have puzzled the most curious to have divined their existence	151.63820034729267
Ali having pointed to the apartments held up three fingers of his right hand and then placing it beneath his head shut his eyes and feigned to sleep	62.46381929342191
I understand said Monte Cristo well acquainted with Alis pantomime you mean to tell me that three female attendants await their new mistress in her sleepingchamber	485.7159133627177
Ali with considerable animation made a sign in the affirmative	12.328276635516438
Madame will be tired tonight continued Monte Cristo and will no doubt wish to rest	80.37082076126033
Desire the French attendants not to weary her with questions but merely to pay their respectful duty and retire	228.4818408718495
You will also see that the Greek servants hold no communication with those of this country	159.65933384811618
Just at that moment voices were heard hailing the concierge	184.84864470935048
The gate opened a carriage rolled down the avenue and stopped at the steps	30.247290062704614
The count hastily descended presented himself at the already opened carriage door and held out his hand to a young woman completely enveloped in a green silk mantle heavily embroidered with gold	97.85763722613073
She raised the hand extended towards her to her lips and kissed it with a mixture of love and respect	41.1885561503949
Some few words passed between them in that sonorous language in which Homer makes his gods converse	402.8789427082015
The young woman spoke with an expression of deep tenderness while the count replied with an air of gentle gravity	32.32539639370894
Preceded by Ali who carried a rosecolored flambeau in his hand the young lady who was no other than the lovely Greek who had been Monte Cristos companion in Italy was conducted to her apartments while the count retired to the pavilion reserved for himself	79.59477326177887
In another hour every light in the house was extinguished and it might have been thought that all its inmates slept	88.49910117597427
About two oclock the following day a calash drawn by a pair of magnificent English horses stopped at the door of Monte Cristo and a person dressed in a blue coat with buttons of a similar color a white waistcoat over which was displayed a massive gold chain brown trousers and a quantity of black hair descending so low over his eyebrows as to leave it doubtful whether it were not artificial so little did its jetty glossiness assimilate with the deep wrinkles stamped on his featuresa person in a word who although evidently past fifty desired to be taken for not more than forty bent forwards from the carriage door on the panels of which were emblazoned the armorial bearings of a baron and directed his groom to inquire at the porters lodge whether the Count of Monte Cristo resided there and if he were within	141.1300278564614
While waiting the occupant of the carriage surveyed the house the garden as far as he could distinguish it and the livery of servants who passed to and fro with an attention so close as to be somewhat impertinent	94.5261761887804
His glance was keen but showed cunning rather than intelligence his lips were straight and so thin that as they closed they were drawn in over the teeth his cheekbones were broad and projecting a neverfailing proof of audacity and craftiness while the flatness of his forehead and the enlargement of the back of his skull which rose much higher than his large and coarsely shaped ears combined to form a physiognomy anything but prepossessing save in the eyes of such as considered that the owner of so splendid an equipage must needs be all that was admirable and enviable more especially when they gazed on the enormous diamond that glittered in his shirt and the red ribbon that depended from his buttonhole	257.2523758592256
The groom in obedience to his orders tapped at the window of the porters lodge saying	139.0146417666511
Pray does not the Count of Monte Cristo live here	13.4486305422061
His excellency does reside here replied the concierge but added he glancing an inquiring look at Ali	165.03565389769886
Ali returned a sign in the negative	109.39968489391448
His excellency does not receive visitors today	2517.939804232342
Then here is my masters card the Baron Danglars	210.29294310457357
You will take it to the count and say that although in haste to attend the Chamber my master came out of his way to have the honor of calling upon him	62.864325229937194
I never speak to his excellency replied the concierge the valet de chambre will carry your message	105.16014290395663
The groom returned to the carriage	482.9527225882769
The man somewhat crestfallen by the rebuke he had received repeated what the concierge had said	147.23286970524947
Bless me murmured Baron Danglars this must surely be a prince instead of a count by their styling him excellency and only venturing to address him by the medium of his valet de chambre	123.41725859620553
However it does not signify he has a letter of credit on me so I must see him when he requires his money	55.23918435880437
Then throwing himself back in his carriage Danglars called out to his coachman in a voice that might be heard across the road To the Chamber of Deputies	78.39064871545709
Apprised in time of the visit paid him Monte Cristo had from behind the blinds of his pavilion as minutely observed the baron by means of an excellent lorgnette as Danglars himself had scrutinized the house garden and servants	254.0308053547148
That fellow has a decidedly bad countenance said the count in a tone of disgust as he shut up his glass into its ivory case	57.00256235914166
How comes it that all do not retreat in aversion at sight of that flat receding serpentlike forehead round vultureshaped head and sharphooked nose like the beak of a buzzard Ali cried he striking at the same time on the brazen gong	386.5741263447401
Almost immediately Bertuccio entered the apartment	116.20355493506634
Did your excellency desire to see me inquired he	51.51441898096067
You no doubt observed the horses standing a few minutes since at the door	52.48390677095645
I noticed them for their remarkable beauty	4087.4884416578084
Then how comes it said Monte Cristo with a frown that when I desired you to purchase for me the finest pair of horses to be found in Paris there is another pair fully as fine as mine not in my stables	96.3489008021439
At the look of displeasure added to the angry tone in which the count spoke Ali turned pale and held down his head	39.170216002991225
It is not your fault my good Ali said the count in the Arabic language and with a gentleness none would have thought him capable of showing either in voice or faceit is not your fault	122.0649364845501
You do not understand the points of English horses	1209.2526659295215
The countenance of poor Ali recovered its serenity	1627.8466265147504
Permit me to assure your excellency said Bertuccio that the horses you speak of were not to be sold when I purchased yours	112.23259122587233
It seems sir steward said he that you have yet to learn that all things are to be sold to such as care to pay the price	54.91029648955046
His excellency is not perhaps aware that M	59.60647111567771
Danglars gave 16000 francs for his horses	21.65893593725207
Then offer him double that sum a banker never loses an opportunity of doubling his capital	434.41417872782466
Is your excellency really in earnest inquired the steward	394.51884736307665
Monte Cristo regarded the person who durst presume to doubt his words with the look of one equally surprised and displeased	175.86067853596805
I have to pay a visit this evening replied he	40.60876486867357
I desire that these horses with completely new harness may be at the door with my carriage	239.063323598631
Bertuccio bowed and was about to retire but when he reached the door he paused and then said At what oclock does your excellency wish the carriage and horses to be ready	76.66319528086103
At five oclock replied the count	1.1763507234917963
I beg your excellencys pardon interposed the steward in a deprecating manner for venturing to observe that it is already two oclock	206.98703223511203
I am perfectly aware of that fact answered Monte Cristo calmly	134.92587564620436
Then turning towards Ali he said Let all the horses in my stables be led before the windows of your young lady that she may select those she prefers for her carriage	149.31034564827405
Request her also to oblige me by saying whether it is her pleasure to dine with me if so let dinner be served in her apartments	80.53323042301115
Now leave me and desire my valet de chambre to come hither	73.04193154373803
Scarcely had Ali disappeared when the valet entered the chamber	32.12936877245223
Monsieur Baptistin said the count you have been in my service one year the time I generally give myself to judge of the merits or demerits of those about me	108.44874097569344
It only remains for me to know whether I also suit you	45.30160067708742
Oh your excellency exclaimed Baptistin eagerly	890.4802478146532
Listen if you please till I have finished speaking replied Monte Cristo	50.57002263284763
You receive 1500 francs per annum for your services heremore than many a brave subaltern who continually risks his life for his country obtains	390.46885299399185
You live in a manner far superior to many clerks who work ten times harder than you do for their money	330.4946053027887
Then though yourself a servant you have other servants to wait upon you take care of your clothes and see that your linen is duly prepared for you	79.26093561853546
Again you make a profit upon each article you purchase for my toilet amounting in the course of a year to a sum equalling your wages	232.2177196922602
I am not condemning you for this Monsieur Baptistin but let your profits end here	617.3803307309407
It would be long indeed ere you would find so lucrative a post as that you have now the good fortune to fill	112.9935560099531
I neither illuse nor illtreat my servants by word or action	177.36426449750874
An error I readily forgive but wilful negligence or forgetfulness never	3731.386158540218
My commands are ordinarily short clear and precise and I would rather be obliged to repeat my words twice or even three times than they should be misunderstood	175.38278069081375
I am rich enough to know whatever I desire to know and I can promise you I am not wanting in curiosity	71.94250351935789
If then I should learn that you had taken upon yourself to speak of me to anyone favorably or unfavorably to comment on my actions or watch my conduct that very instant you would quit my service	188.45795556593114
I never caution my servants a second timeremember that	832.1068653180155
Baptistin bowed and was proceeding towards the door	5.6511476636645455
I forgot to mention to you said the count that I lay yearly aside a certain sum for each servant in my establishment those whom I am compelled to dismiss lose as a matter of course all participation in this money while their portion goes to the fund accumulating for those domestics who remain with me and among whom it will be divided at my death	169.8817643446845
You have been in my service a year your fund has already begun to accumulatelet it continue to do so	192.7134023804274
This address delivered in the presence of Ali who not understanding one word of the language in which it was spoken stood wholly unmoved produced an effect on M	158.48781345920253
Baptistin only to be conceived by such as have occasion to study the character and disposition of French domestics	292.33895379704444
I assure your excellency said he that at least it shall be my study to merit your approbation in all things and I will take M	65.6707687632793
By no means replied the count in the most frigid tones Ali has many faults mixed with most excellent qualities	385.7464557500836
He can not possibly serve you as a pattern for your conduct not being as you are a paid servant but a mere slavea dog who should he fail in his duty towards me I should not discharge from my service but kill	158.43868558025864
Baptistin opened his eyes with astonishment	28.91190710923844
You seem incredulous said Monte Cristo who repeated to Ali in the Arabic language what he had just been saying to Baptistin in French	55.06254063635761
The Nubian smiled assentingly to his masters words then kneeling on one knee respectfully kissed the hand of the count	60.622793261421634
This corroboration of the lesson he had just received put the finishing stroke to the wonder and stupefaction of M	194.3927700261829
The count then motioned the valet de chambre to retire and to Ali to follow to his study where they conversed long and earnestly together	73.6010506114723
As the hand of the clock pointed to five the count struck thrice upon his gong	287.73519693100224
When Ali was wanted one stroke was given two summoned Baptistin and three Bertuccio	722.4159997292147
They are at the door harnessed to the carriage as your excellency desired	191.9845599602569
Does your excellency wish me to accompany him	17.916106390463955
No the coachman Ali and Baptistin will go	124.62431271977431
The count descended to the door of his mansion and beheld his carriage drawn by the very pair of horses he had so much admired in the morning as the property of Danglars	63.816964514217446
As he passed them he said	13.670116897266833
They are extremely handsome certainly and you have done well to purchase them although you were somewhat remiss not to have procured them sooner	121.30527532954486
Indeed your excellency I had very considerable difficulty in obtaining them and as it is they have cost an enormous price	310.12143840110826
Does the sum you gave for them make the animals less beautiful inquired the count shrugging his shoulders	156.78014604594844
Nay if your excellency is satisfied it is all that I could wish	52.305847400083486
Whither does your excellency desire to be driven	53.90834320523653
To the residence of Baron Danglars Rue de la Chausse dAntin	5.311989245273648
This conversation had passed as they stood upon the terrace from which a flight of stone steps led to the carriagedrive	131.60796339651057
As Bertuccio with a respectful bow was moving away the count called him back	82.2212764322779
I have another commission for you M	42.858625232340586
Bertuccio said he I am desirous of having an estate by the seaside in Normandyfor instance between Le Havre and Boulogne	359.26007914562337
You see I give you a wide range	2362.1253308054274
It will be absolutely necessary that the place you may select have a small harbor creek or bay into which my corvette can enter and remain at anchor	383.5629500521486
She must be kept in constant readiness to sail immediately I think proper to give the signal	272.937555698549
Make the requisite inquiries for a place of this description and when you have met with an eligible spot visit it and if it possess the advantages desired purchase it at once in your own name	172.39013827043794
The corvette must now I think be on her way to Fcamp must she not	166.70080419920984
Certainly your excellency I saw her put to sea the same evening we quitted Marseilles	209.47482942406356
Was ordered to remain at Martigues	110027.56183628095
I wish you to write from time to time to the captains in charge of the two vessels so as to keep them on the alert	61.14910804839199
The same orders for her as for the two sailing vessels	480.96232421334486
When you have purchased the estate I desire I want constant relays of horses at ten leagues apart along the northern and southern road	589.0401294876386
Your excellency may depend upon me	3.6263045066923008
The Count made a gesture of satisfaction descended the terrace steps and sprang into his carriage which was whirled along swiftly to the bankers house	168.93289357108296
Danglars was engaged at that moment presiding over a railroad committee	1694.3863499453237
But the meeting was nearly concluded when the name of his visitor was announced	77.3843752792246
As the counts title sounded on his ear he rose and addressing his colleagues who were members of one or the other Chamber he said	66.83363478600637
Gentlemen pardon me for leaving you so abruptly but a most ridiculous circumstance has occurred which is thisThomson   French the Roman bankers have sent to me a certain person calling himself the Count of Monte Cristo and have given him an unlimited credit with me	128.21038242163706
I confess this is the drollest thing I have ever met with in the course of my extensive foreign transactions and you may readily suppose it has greatly roused my curiosity	214.4713766308405
I took the trouble this morning to call on the pretended countif he were a real count he would nt be so rich	163.53604658442737
But would you believe it He was not receiving	317.36737430531053
So the master of Monte Cristo gives himself airs befitting a great millionaire or a capricious beauty	673.388664232158
I made inquiries and found that the house in the Champslyses is his own property and certainly it was very decently kept up	87.07205481757887
But pursued Danglars with one of his sinister smiles an order for unlimited credit calls for something like caution on the part of the banker to whom that order is given	112.4635081041067
I am very anxious to see this man	33.56558367959809
I suspect a hoax is intended but the instigators of it little knew whom they had to deal with	234.63158823957883
They laugh best who laugh last	2343.9694472924834
Having delivered himself of this pompous address uttered with a degree of energy that left the baron almost out of breath he bowed to the assembled party and withdrew to his drawingroom whose sumptuous furnishings of white and gold had caused a great sensation in the Chausse dAntin	215.71320242749368
It was to this apartment he had desired his guest to be shown with the purpose of overwhelming him at the sight of so much luxury	84.45097860523411
He found the count standing before some copies of Albano and Fattore that had been passed off to the banker as originals but which mere copies as they were seemed to feel their degradation in being brought into juxtaposition with the gaudy colors that covered the ceiling	281.52667567373163
The count turned round as he heard the entrance of Danglars into the room	30.108589250992022
With a slight inclination of the head Danglars signed to the count to be seated pointing significantly to a gilded armchair covered with white satin embroidered with gold	95.05981329065399
I have the honor I presume of addressing M	229.15877456207065
And I of speaking to Baron Danglars chevalier of the Legion of Honor and member of the Chamber of Deputies	64.50745129069303
Monte Cristo repeated all the titles he had read on the barons card	207.61102444874334
Danglars felt the irony and compressed his lips	194.91375508891724
You will I trust excuse me monsieur for not calling you by your title when I first addressed you he said but you are aware that we are living under a popular form of government and that I am myself a representative of the liberties of the people	79.63984631645677
So much so replied Monte Cristo that while you call yourself baron you are not willing to call anybody else count	75.44122487272206
Upon my word monsieur said Danglars with affected carelessness I attach no sort of value to such empty distinctions but the fact is I was made baron and also chevalier of the Legion of Honor in return for services rendered but	190.36091256499847
But you have discarded your titles after the example set you by Messrs	1049.2098808758267
de Montmorency and Lafayette That was a noble example to follow monsieur	321.62906525250344
Why replied Danglars not entirely so with the servantsyou understand	546.8956740942182
I see to your domestics you are my lord the journalists style you monsieur while your constituents call you citizen	434.94161129487003
These are distinctions very suitable under a constitutional government	2678.0358026081794
Again Danglars bit his lips he saw that he was no match for Monte Cristo in an argument of this sort and he therefore hastened to turn to subjects more congenial	109.93852350899027
Permit me to inform you Count said he bowing that I have received a letter of advice from Thomson   French of Rome	82.04164607192287
I am glad to hear it baronfor I must claim the privilege of addressing you after the manner of your servants	117.95667534377303
I have acquired the bad habit of calling persons by their titles from living in a country where barons are still barons by right of birth	243.1126686181675
But as regards the letter of advice I am charmed to find that it has reached you that will spare me the troublesome and disagreeable task of coming to you for money myself	101.50055722596541
You have received a regular letter of advice	122.44957137259387
Yes said Danglars but I confess I did nt quite comprehend its meaning	618.5828133743701
And for that reason I did myself the honor of calling upon you in order to beg for an explanation	47.208574565795615
Here I am ready to give you any explanation you desire	56.03712777768324
Why said Danglars in the letterI believe I have it about mehere he felt in his breastpocketyes here it is	462.05101135166404
Well this letter gives the Count of Monte Cristo unlimited credit on our house	52.3913179440569
Well baron what is there difficult to understand about that	114.70522204966105
Merely the term unlimitednothing else certainly	6767.584848283356
Is not that word known in France The people who wrote are AngloGermans you know	190.6808160835715
Oh as for the composition of the letter there is nothing to be said but as regards the competency of the document I certainly have doubts	111.47015508655241
Is it possible asked the count assuming all air and tone of the utmost simplicity and candor	136.19052722278286
Is it possible that Thomson   French are not looked upon as safe and solvent bankers Pray tell me what you think baron for I feel uneasy I can assure you having some considerable property in their hands	167.91637216604937
Thomson   French are perfectly solvent replied Danglars with an almost mocking smile but the word unlimited in financial affairs is so extremely vague	217.81398855433986
Is in fact unlimited said Monte Cristo	1.9875741827987772
Precisely what I was about to say cried Danglars	51.20592914923422
Now what is vague is doubtful and it was a wise man who said when in doubt keep out	153.8853856253161
Meaning to say rejoined Monte Cristo that however Thomson   French may be inclined to commit acts of imprudence and folly the Baron Danglars is not disposed to follow their example	127.00346453531223
Thomson   French set no bounds to their engagements while those of M	193.7129020398273
Danglars have their limits he is a wise man according to his own showing	84.27611532441506
Monsieur replied the banker drawing himself up with a haughty air the extent of my resources has never yet been questioned	72.69503367933584
It seems then reserved for me said Monte Cristo coldly to be the first to do so	19.19797206315667
By right of the objections you have raised and the explanations you have demanded which certainly must have some motive	220.8211436245604
Once more Danglars bit his lips	24.177130403888864
It was the second time he had been worsted and this time on his own ground	67.0756612101604
His forced politeness sat awkwardly upon him and approached almost to impertinence	70.62529648020332
Monte Cristo on the contrary preserved a graceful suavity of demeanor aided by a certain degree of simplicity he could assume at pleasure and thus possessed the advantage	330.9782085561763
Well sir resumed Danglars after a brief silence I will endeavor to make myself understood by requesting you to inform me for what sum you propose to draw upon me	53.407909005055316
Why truly replied Monte Cristo determined not to lose an inch of the ground he had gained my reason for desiring an unlimited credit was precisely because I did not know how much money I might need	122.83924647179629
The banker thought the time had come for him to take the upper hand	39.96101622052695
So throwing himself back in his armchair he said with an arrogant and purseproud air	123.8964911667677
Let me beg of you not to hesitate in naming your wishes you will then be convinced that the resources of the house of Danglars however limited are still equal to meeting the largest demands and were you even to require a million	196.40783605376404
I beg your pardon interposed Monte Cristo	14.117013317345348
I said a million replied Danglars with the confidence of ignorance	37.48522826312796
But could I do with a million retorted the count	62.29582206407246
My dear sir if a trifle like that could suffice me I should never have given myself the trouble of opening an account	144.4476367837925
A million Excuse my smiling when you speak of a sum I am in the habit of carrying in my pocketbook or dressingcase	94.59320060000782
And with these words Monte Cristo took from his pocket a small case containing his visitingcards and drew forth two orders on the treasury for 500000 francs each payable at sight to the bearer	84.6852951771921
A man like Danglars was wholly inaccessible to any gentler method of correction	1554.6257030287265
The effect of the present revelation was stunning he trembled and was on the verge of apoplexy	289.7928316974013
The pupils of his eyes as he gazed at Monte Cristo dilated horribly	121.43739129957972
Come come said Monte Cristo confess honestly that you have not perfect confidence in Thomson   French	294.21642562726163
I understand and foreseeing that such might be the case I took in spite of my ignorance of affairs certain precautions	153.79555486573858
See here are two similar letters to that you have yourself received one from the house of Arstein   Eskeles of Vienna to Baron Rothschild the other drawn by Baring of London upon M	355.8656408096152
Now sir you have but to say the word and I will spare you all uneasiness by presenting my letter of credit to one or other of these two firms	106.83786028565466
The blow had struck home and Danglars was entirely vanquished with a trembling hand he took the two letters from the count who held them carelessly between finger and thumb and proceeded to scrutinize the signatures with a minuteness that the count might have regarded as insulting had it not suited his present purpose to mislead the banker	163.93434021166817
Oh sir said Danglars after he had convinced himself of the authenticity of the documents he held and rising as if to salute the power of gold personified in the man before himthree letters of unlimited credit I can be no longer mistrustful but you must pardon me my dear count for confessing to some degree of astonishment	128.35458509230259
Nay answered Monte Cristo with the most gentlemanly air tis not for such trifling sums as these that your banking house is to be incommoded	298.13808686699787
Then you can let me have some money can you not	50.316705861171634
Whatever you say my dear count I am at your orders	33.5584734035944
Why replied Monte Cristo since we mutually understand each otherfor such I presume is the case Danglars bowed assentingly	949.271830579049
You are quite sure that not a lurking doubt or suspicion lingers in your mind	536.6462712648333
Oh my dear count exclaimed Danglars I never for an instant entertained such a feeling towards you	105.48892833616523
No you merely wished to be convinced nothing more but now that we have come to so clear an understanding and that all distrust and suspicion are laid at rest we may as well fix a sum as the probable expenditure of the first year suppose we say six millions to	187.48194903344037
Six millions gasped Danglarsso be it	320.578691423058
Then if I should require more continued Monte Cristo in a careless manner why of course I should draw upon you but my present intention is not to remain in France more than a year and during that period I scarcely think I shall exceed the sum I mentioned	103.50477367023238
Be kind enough then to send me 500000 francs tomorrow	38.924607377238594
I shall be at home till midday or if not I will leave a receipt with my steward	138.6190188347132
The money you desire shall be at your house by ten oclock tomorrow morning my dear count replied Danglars	22.52151939084008
How would you like to have it in gold silver or notes	221.95963043641845
Half in gold and the other half in banknotes if you please said the count rising from his seat	35.7098069886913
I must confess to you count said Danglars that I have hitherto imagined myself acquainted with the degree of all the great fortunes of Europe and still wealth such as yours has been wholly unknown to me	78.67648344526361
May I presume to ask whether you have long possessed it	79.23753499811991
It has been in the family a very long while returned Monte Cristo a sort of treasure expressly forbidden to be touched for a certain period of years during which the accumulated interest has doubled the capital	236.62630049907122
The period appointed by the testator for the disposal of these riches occurred only a short time ago and they have only been employed by me within the last few years	95.5590728904385
Your ignorance on the subject therefore is easily accounted for	1435.230146017796
However you will be better informed as to me and my possessions ere long	224.2403946779593
And the count while pronouncing these latter words accompanied them with one of those ghastly smiles that used to strike terror into poor Franz dpinay	276.6795042038434
With your tastes and means of gratifying them continued Danglars you will exhibit a splendor that must effectually put us poor miserable millionaires quite in the shade	579.7072963136192
If I mistake not you are an admirer of paintings at least I judged so from the attention you appeared to be bestowing on mine when I entered the room	159.64687105382592
If you will permit me I shall be happy to show you my picture gallery composed entirely of works by the ancient masterswarranted as such	364.14587636351104
Not a modern picture among them	31.502143754447406
I can not endure the modern school of painting	1925.7993438211975
You are perfectly right in objecting to them for this one great faultthat they have not yet had time to become old	216.02263973769402
Or will you allow me to show you several fine statues by Thorwaldsen Bartoloni and Canovaall foreign artists for as you may perceive I think but very indifferently of our French sculptors	889.4263429232803
You have a right to be unjust to them monsieur they are your compatriots	366.128457378408
But all this may come later when we shall be better known to each other	87.21223067616413
For the present I will confine myself if perfectly agreeable to you to introducing you to the Baroness Danglarsexcuse my impatience my dear count but a client like you is almost like a member of the family	164.59845576230174
Monte Cristo bowed in sign that he accepted the proffered honor Danglars rang and was answered by a servant in a showy livery	172.09533381432595
Is the baroness at home inquired Danglars	36.1969317391069
Yes my lord answered the man	24.579678701270655
No my lord madame has visitors	94447.83188270946
Have you any objection to meet any persons who may be with madame or do you desire to preserve a strict incognito	203.0789176390901
No indeed replied Monte Cristo with a smile I do not arrogate to myself the right of so doing	48.58249414884543
Debray inquired Danglars with an air of indulgence and goodnature that made Monte Cristo smile acquainted as he was with the secrets of the bankers domestic life	115.07425314396008
Yes my lord replied the servant M	309.7985775861826
Danglars nodded his head then turning to Monte Cristo said M	22.501381160074107
Lucien Debray is an old friend of ours and private secretary to the Minister of the Interior	102.39208628251102
As for my wife I must tell you she lowered herself by marrying me for she belongs to one of the most ancient families in France	109.80573578284786
Her maiden name was De Servires and her first husband was Colonel the Marquis of Nargonne	263.6400934106022
I have not the honor of knowing Madame Danglars but I have already met M	31.925341115400617
Ah indeed said Danglars and where was that	277.8227511865822
Ah you are acquainted with the young viscount are you	85.46630794112369
We were together a good deal during the Carnival at Rome	173.62484857678467
Let me see have I not heard talk of some strange adventure with bandits or thieves hid in ruins and of his having had a miraculous escape I forget how but I know he used to amuse my wife and daughter by telling them about it after his return from Italy	181.612689477807
Her ladyship is waiting to receive you gentlemen said the servant who had gone to inquire the pleasure of his mistress	41.932917054810794
With your permission said Danglars bowing I will precede you to show you the way	93.97928683722948
By all means replied Monte Cristo I follow you	25.69134765972833
The baron followed by the count traversed a long series of apartments in which the prevailing characteristics were heavy magnificence and the gaudiness of ostentatious wealth until he reached the boudoir of Madame Danglarsa small octagonalshaped room hung with pink satin covered with white Indian muslin	451.47820994869096
The chairs were of ancient workmanship and materials over the doors were painted sketches of shepherds and shepherdesses after the style and manner of Boucher and at each side pretty medallions in crayons harmonizing well with the furnishings of this charming apartment the only one throughout the great mansion in which any distinctive taste prevailed	598.6910690752815
The truth was it had been entirely overlooked in the plan arranged and followed out by M	258.29552312899364
Danglars and his architect who had been selected to aid the baron in the great work of improvement solely because he was the most fashionable and celebrated decorator of the day	172.3895135591375
The decorations of the boudoir had then been left entirely to Madame Danglars and Lucien Debray	76.22259301011013
Danglars however while possessing a great admiration for the antique as it was understood during the time of the Directory entertained the most sovereign contempt for the simple elegance of his wifes favorite sittingroom where by the way he was never permitted to intrude unless indeed he excused his own appearance by ushering in some more agreeable visitor than himself and even then he had rather the air and manner of a person who was himself introduced than that of being the presenter of another his reception being cordial or frigid in proportion as the person who accompanied him chanced to please or displease the baroness	222.15379227541425
Madame Danglars who although past the first bloom of youth was still strikingly handsome was now seated at the piano a most elaborate piece of cabinet and inlaid work while Lucien Debray standing before a small worktable was turning over the pages of an album	269.5387242357998
Lucien had found time preparatory to the counts arrival to relate many particulars respecting him to Madame Danglars	112.12890326280633
It will be remembered that Monte Cristo had made a lively impression on the minds of all the party assembled at the breakfast given by Albert de Morcerf and although Debray was not in the habit of yielding to such feelings he had never been able to shake off the powerful influence excited in his mind by the impressive look and manner of the count consequently the description given by Lucien to the baroness bore the highlycolored tinge of his own heated imagination	93.10472634092974
Already excited by the wonderful stories related of the count by de Morcerf it is no wonder that Madame Danglars eagerly listened to and fully credited all the additional circumstances detailed by Debray	256.51550145812473
This posing at the piano and over the album was only a little ruse adopted by way of precaution	191.38927021141993
A most gracious welcome and unusual smile were bestowed on M	277.8483644346785
Danglars the count in return for his gentlemanly bow received a formal though graceful courtesy while Lucien exchanged with the count a sort of distant recognition and with Danglars a free and easy nod	494.3046141475982
Baroness said Danglars give me leave to present to you the Count of Monte Cristo who has been most warmly recommended to me by my correspondents at Rome	44.54477067599954
I need but mention one fact to make all the ladies in Paris court his notice and that is that he has come to take up his abode in Paris for a year during which brief period he proposes to spend six millions of money	71.01863202721115
That means balls dinners and lawn parties without end in all of which I trust the count will remember us as he may depend upon it we shall him in our own humble entertainments	175.5987389806863
In spite of the gross flattery and coarseness of this address Madame Danglars could not forbear gazing with considerable interest on a man capable of expending six millions in twelve months and who had selected Paris for the scene of his princely extravagance	171.57447939145257
And when did you arrive here inquired she	85.54655053475153
Coming as usual I presume from the extreme end of the globe Pardon meat least such I have heard is your custom	341.73478640241404
This time I have merely come from Cadiz	1038.9001913328927
You have selected a most unfavorable moment for your first visit	214.16339106257786
Paris is a horrible place in summer	1201.0690300280608
Balls parties and ftes are over the Italian opera is in London the French opera everywhere except in Paris	324.6367279846844
As for the Thatre Franais you know of course that it is nowhere	118.78549247921616
The only amusements left us are the indifferent races at the ChampdeMars and Satory	584.581596995759
Do you propose entering any horses at either of these races count	759.871819201177
I shall do whatever they do at Paris madame if I have the good fortune to find someone who will initiate me into the prevalent ideas of amusement	104.6004943477275
Are you fond of horses count	162.86128816802616
I have passed a considerable part of my life in the East madame and you are doubtless aware that the Orientals value only two thingsthe fine breeding of their horses and the beauty of their women	180.01783151720886
Nay count said the baroness it would have been somewhat more gallant to have placed the ladies first	98.23818053397474
You see madame how rightly I spoke when I said I required a preceptor to guide me in all my sayings and doings here	261.99737847843096
At this instant the favorite attendant of Madame Danglars entered the boudoir approaching her mistress she spoke some words in an undertone	122.03354349007502
Madame Danglars turned very pale then exclaimed	103.53312651578875
I can not believe it the thing is impossible	91.43360487204731
I assure you madame replied the woman it is as I have said	25.33945249683628
Turning impatiently towards her husband Madame Danglars demanded Is this true	255.38647735453858
Is what true madame inquired Danglars visibly agitated	391.53713954567235
But what does she tell you	5.651408155130024
That when my coachman was about to harness the horses to my carriage he discovered that they had been removed from the stables without his knowledge	95.0197908902643
I desire to know what is the meaning of this	18.877646667282587
Be kind enough madame to listen to me said Danglars	24.096623657302924
Oh yes I will listen monsieur for I am most curious to hear what explanation you will give	100.25444892781057
These two gentlemen shall decide between us but first I will state the case to them	157.68717342380378
Gentlemen continued the baroness among the ten horses in the stables of Baron Danglars are two that belong exclusively to mea pair of the handsomest and most spirited creatures to be found in Paris	218.18644664008693
But to you at least M	314.3971770304643
Debray I need not give a further description because to you my beautiful pair of dappled grays were well known	429.0809020306938
Well I had promised Madame de Villefort the loan of my carriage to drive tomorrow to the Bois but when my coachman goes to fetch the grays from the stables they are gonepositively gone	218.7533393724223
Danglars has sacrificed them to the selfish consideration of gaining some thousands of paltry francs	410.22722894892473
Oh what a detestable crew they are these mercenary speculators	1387.1370486020605
Madame replied Danglars the horses were not sufficiently quiet for you they were scarcely four years old and they made me extremely uneasy on your account	126.3650241962118
Nonsense retorted the baroness you could not have entertained any alarm on the subject because you are perfectly well aware that I have had for a month in my service the very best coachman in Paris	78.50648896896358
But perhaps you have disposed of the coachman as well as the horses	37.87682219982687
My dear love pray do not say any more about them and I promise you another pair exactly like them in appearance only more quiet and steady	174.45686569509868
The baroness shrugged her shoulders with an air of ineffable contempt while her husband affecting not to observe this unconjugal gesture turned towards Monte Cristo and saidUpon my word count I am quite sorry not to have met you sooner	110.33328138338807
You are setting up an establishment of course	421.9472686534214
I should have liked to have made you the offer of these horses	60.36718741898953
I have almost given them away as it is but as I before said I was anxious to get rid of them upon any terms	64.06498099277482
They were only fit for a young man	15.399717289900106
I am much obliged by your kind intentions towards me said Monte Cristo but this morning I purchased a very excellent pair of carriagehorses and I do not think they were dear	82.83648991632498
Debray you are a connoisseur I believe let me have your opinion upon them	95.8461142436347
As Debray walked towards the window Danglars approached his wife	47.75170469427286
I could not tell you before others said he in a low tone the reason of my parting with the horses but a most enormous price was offered me this morning for them	80.66325437287523
Some madman or fool bent upon ruining himself as fast as he can actually sent his steward to me to purchase them at any cost and the fact is I have gained 16000 francs by the sale of them	104.14919896686186
Come do nt look so angry and you shall have 4000 francs of the money to do what you like with and Eugnie shall have 2000	99.88544962587133
There what do you think now of the affair Was nt I right to part with the horses	237.20719169515687
Madame Danglars surveyed her husband with a look of withering contempt	76.87943123939054
What is it asked the baroness	19.099460007416496
I can not be mistaken there are your horses The very animals we were speaking of harnessed to the counts carriage	151.2487283331392
My dappled grays demanded the baroness springing to the window	51.08892848615128
How very singular cried Monte Cristo with wellfeigned astonishment	49.14807513928161
I can not believe it murmured the banker	95.69861988888452
Madame Danglars whispered a few words in the ear of Debray who approached Monte Cristo saying The baroness wishes to know what you paid her husband for the horses	43.3669275863805
I scarcely know replied the count it was a little surprise prepared for me by my steward and cost mewell somewhere about 30000 francs	154.75936181837528
Debray conveyed the counts reply to the baroness	9.985807805455304
Poor Danglars looked so crestfallen and discomfited that Monte Cristo assumed a pitying air towards him	177.00450156495532
See said the count how very ungrateful women are	528.874224025958
Your kind attention in providing for the safety of the baroness by disposing of the horses does not seem to have made the least impression on her	63.89794674261864
But so it is a woman will often from mere wilfulness prefer that which is dangerous to that which is safe	385.85873726238884
Therefore in my opinion my dear baron the best and easiest way is to leave them to their fancies and allow them to act as they please and then if any mischief follows why at least they have no one to blame but themselves	138.57000218275485
Danglars made no reply he was occupied in anticipations of the coming scene between himself and the baroness whose frowning brow like that of Olympic Jove predicted a storm	316.91218532331
Debray who perceived the gathering clouds and felt no desire to witness the explosion of Madame Danglars rage suddenly recollected an appointment which compelled him to take his leave while Monte Cristo unwilling by prolonging his stay to destroy the advantages he hoped to obtain made a farewell bow and departed leaving Danglars to endure the angry reproaches of his wife	169.0066862806854
Excellent murmured Monte Cristo to himself as he came away	56.42731410165113
All has gone according to my wishes	81.89565470463043
The domestic peace of this family is henceforth in my hands	211.50562278763076
Now then to play another masterstroke by which I shall gain the heart of both husband and wifedelightful Still added he amid all this I have not yet been presented to Mademoiselle Eugnie Danglars whose acquaintance I should have been glad to make	125.7036662192645
But he went on with his peculiar smile I am here in Paris and have plenty of time before meby and by will do for that	140.14984248500386
With these reflections he entered his carriage and returned home	42.66926860076391
Two hours afterwards Madame Danglars received a most flattering epistle from the count in which he entreated her to receive back her favorite dappled grays protesting that he could not endure the idea of making his entry into the Parisian world of fashion with the knowledge that his splendid equipage had been obtained at the price of a lovely womans regrets	159.28618909111654
The horses were sent back wearing the same harness she had seen on them in the morning only by the counts orders in the centre of each rosette that adorned either side of their heads had been fastened a large diamond	154.6699220442124
To Danglars Monte Cristo also wrote requesting him to excuse the whimsical gift of a capricious millionaire and to beg the baroness to pardon the Eastern fashion adopted in the return of the horses	159.56631432006495
During the evening Monte Cristo quitted Paris for Auteuil accompanied by Ali	178.60163876183807
The following day about three oclock a single blow struck on the gong summoned Ali to the presence of the count	57.67831063192979
Ali observed his master as the Nubian entered the chamber you have frequently explained to me how more than commonly skilful you are in throwing the lasso have you not	276.30815131289944
Ali drew himself up proudly and then returned a sign in the affirmative	27.07798383521536
I thought I did not mistake	2578.7119745951645
With your lasso you could stop an ox	874.9867160896413
Again Ali repeated his affirmative gesture	653.154011670333
Ali bowed his head in token of assent	10.745163752493655
Ali sprung forwards imitating the action of one throwing the lasso then of a strangled lion	359.4445405097499
I understand said Monte Cristo you wish to tell me you have hunted the lion	106.61078114155805
Ali smiled with triumphant pride as he signified that he had indeed both chased and captured many lions	429.88751695032494
But do you believe you could arrest the progress of two horses rushing forwards with ungovernable fury	771.829324271766
It is well said Monte Cristo	1.0002799034037588
Ere long a carriage will dash past here drawn by the pair of dappled gray horses you saw me with yesterday now at the risk of your own life you must manage to stop those horses before my door	187.22030933130574
Ali descended to the street and marked a straight line on the pavement immediately at the entrance of the house and then pointed out the line he had traced to the count who was watching him	45.28314229137437
The count patted him gently on the shoulder his usual mode of praising Ali who pleased and gratified with the commission assigned him walked calmly towards a projecting stone forming the angle of the street and house and seating himself thereon began to smoke his chibouque while Monte Cristo reentered his dwelling perfectly assured of the success of his plan	193.95127399461913
Still as five oclock approached and the carriage was momentarily expected by the count the indication of more than common impatience and uneasiness might be observed in his manner	109.78679256631222
He stationed himself in a room commanding a view of the street pacing the chamber with restless steps stopping merely to listen from time to time for the sound of approaching wheels then to cast an anxious glance on Ali but the regularity with which the Nubian puffed forth the smoke of his chibouque proved that he at least was wholly absorbed in the enjoyment of his favorite occupation	161.33027551342673
Suddenly a distant sound of rapidly advancing wheels was heard and almost immediately a carriage appeared drawn by a pair of wild ungovernable horses while the terrified coachman strove in vain to restrain their furious speed	341.86239172895733
In the vehicle was a young woman and a child of about seven or eight clasped in each others arms	81.36370733845055
Terror seemed to have deprived them even of the power of uttering a cry	68.92188266202831
The carriage creaked and rattled as it flew over the rough stones and the slightest obstacle under the wheels would have caused disaster but it kept on in the middle of the road and those who saw it pass uttered cries of terror	137.251492169813
Ali suddenly cast aside his chibouque drew the lasso from his pocket threw it so skilfully as to catch the forelegs of the near horse in its triple fold and suffered himself to be dragged on for a few steps by the violence of the shock then the animal fell over on the pole which snapped and therefore prevented the other horse from pursuing its way	137.97988647047467
Gladly availing himself of this opportunity the coachman leaped from his box but Ali had promptly seized the nostrils of the second horse and held them in his iron grasp till the beast snorting with pain sunk beside his companion	174.31971921712488
All this was achieved in much less time than is occupied in the recital	101.00789329215188
The brief space had however been sufficient for a man followed by a number of servants to rush from the house before which the accident had occurred and as the coachman opened the door of the carriage to take from it a lady who was convulsively grasping the cushions with one hand while with the other she pressed to her bosom the young boy who had lost consciousness	62.30384394599407
Monte Cristo carried them both to the salon and deposited them on a sofa	57.357221189741196
Compose yourself madame said he all danger is over	315.8079904360707
The woman looked up at these words and with a glance far more expressive than any entreaties could have been pointed to her child who still continued insensible	102.97251554880843
I understand the nature of your alarms madame said the count carefully examining the child but I assure you there is not the slightest occasion for uneasiness your little charge has not received the least injury his insensibility is merely the effects of terror and will soon pass	119.18701512685844
Are you quite sure you do not say so to tranquillize my fears See how deadly pale he is My child my darling Edward speak to your motheropen your dear eyes and look on me once again Oh sir in pity send for a physician my whole fortune shall not be thought too much for the recovery of my boy	184.77567595605768
With a calm smile and a gentle wave of the hand Monte Cristo signed to the distracted mother to lay aside her apprehensions then opening a casket that stood near he drew forth a phial of Bohemian glass incrusted with gold containing a liquid of the color of blood of which he let fall a single drop on the childs lips	117.40254518341283
Scarcely had it reached them ere the boy though still pale as marble opened his eyes and eagerly gazed around him	104.9628034791059
At this the delight of the mother was almost frantic	481.286979506394
Where am I exclaimed she and to whom am I indebted for so happy a termination to my late dreadful alarm	256.9672386985247
Madame answered the count you are under the roof of one who esteems himself most fortunate in having been able to save you from a further continuance of your sufferings	129.9159455918642
My wretched curiosity has brought all this about pursued the lady	175.12947466789493
All Paris rung with the praises of Madame Danglars beautiful horses and I had the folly to desire to know whether they really merited the high praise given to them	151.8486718799514
Is it possible exclaimed the count with wellfeigned astonishment that these horses belong to the baroness	87.59703780018384
May I inquire if you are acquainted with Madame Danglars	50.77683819277238
I have that honor and my happiness at your escape from the danger that threatened you is redoubled by the consciousness that I have been the unwilling and the unintentional cause of all the peril you have incurred	183.7617125742768
I yesterday purchased these horses of the baron but as the baroness evidently regretted parting with them I ventured to send them back to her with a request that she would gratify me by accepting them from my hands	132.9070117949166
You are then doubtless the Count of Monte Cristo of whom Hermine has talked to me so much	34.992603864732914
You have rightly guessed madame replied the count	8.727471143889622
And I am Madame Hlose de Villefort	184.8888906407607
The count bowed with the air of a person who hears a name for the first time	32.37713904023789
de Villefort be for all your goodness how thankfully will he acknowledge that to you alone he owes the existence of his wife and child Most certainly but for the prompt assistance of your intrepid servant this dear child and myself must both have perished	271.50743007759223
Indeed I still shudder at the fearful danger you were placed in	131.07869943123563
I trust you will allow me to recompense worthily the devotion of your man	191.69809876118435
I beseech you madame replied Monte Cristo not to spoil Ali either by too great praise or rewards	395.8651115894506
I can not allow him to acquire the habit of expecting to be recompensed for every trifling service he may render	142.13413001612182
Ali is my slave and in saving your life he was but discharging his duty to me	164.01645277348692
Nay interposed Madame de Villefort on whom the authoritative style adopted by the count made a deep impression nay but consider that to preserve my life he has risked his own	135.8037290351885
His life madame belongs not to him it is mine in return for my having myself saved him from death	88.22490611729572
Madame de Villefort made no further reply her mind was utterly absorbed in the contemplation of the person who from the first instant she saw him had made so powerful an impression on her	62.78867603045003
During the evident preoccupation of Madame de Villefort Monte Cristo scrutinized the features and appearance of the boy she kept folded in her arms lavishing on him the most tender endearments	139.435581024521
The child was small for his age and unnaturally pale	288.81359329687217
A mass of straight black hair defying all attempts to train or curl it fell over his projecting forehead and hung down to his shoulders giving increased vivacity to eyes already sparkling with a youthful love of mischief and fondness for every forbidden enjoyment	467.3374723054748
His mouth was large and the lips which had not yet regained their color were particularly thin in fact the deep and crafty look giving a predominant expression to the childs face belonged rather to a boy of twelve or fourteen than to one so young	246.39774893482857
His first movement was to free himself by a violent push from the encircling arms of his mother and to rush forward to the casket from whence the count had taken the phial of elixir then without asking permission of anyone he proceeded in all the wilfulness of a spoiled child unaccustomed to restrain either whims or caprices to pull the corks out of all the bottles	159.08329811119532
Touch nothing my little friend cried the count eagerly some of those liquids are not only dangerous to taste but even to inhale	182.35686404452161
Madame de Villefort became very pale and seizing her sons arm drew him anxiously toward her but once satisfied of his safety she also cast a brief but expressive glance on the casket which was not lost upon the count	87.97825223921338
At sight of him Madame de Villefort uttered an expression of pleasure and holding the child still closer towards her she said	61.28531295512595
Edward dearest do you see that good man He has shown very great courage and resolution for he exposed his own life to stop the horses that were running away with us and would certainly have dashed the carriage to pieces	150.20711438604607
Thank him then my child in your very best manner for had he not come to our aid neither you nor I would have been alive to speak our thanks	137.11792303037805
The child stuck out his lips and turned away his head in a disdainful manner saying He s too ugly	127.45862155068777
The count smiled as if the child bade fair to realize his hopes while Madame de Villefort reprimanded her son with a gentleness and moderation very far from conveying the least idea of a fault having been committed	151.14122309632893
This lady said the Count speaking to Ali in the Arabic language is desirous that her son should thank you for saving both their lives but the boy refuses saying you are too ugly	163.86850256617865
Ali turned his intelligent countenance towards the boy on whom he gazed without any apparent emotion but the spasmodic working of the nostrils showed to the practiced eye of Monte Cristo that the Arab had been wounded to the heart	106.7795384856248
Will you permit me to inquire said Madame de Villefort as she arose to take her leave whether you usually reside here	75.62047658106518
No I do not replied Monte Cristo it is a small place I have purchased quite lately	57.896954322086096
My place of abode is No	1162.6153215000882
30 Avenue des Champslyses but I see you have quite recovered from your fright and are no doubt desirous of returning home	99.03930418834425
Anticipating your wishes I have desired the same horses you came with to be put to one of my carriages and Ali he whom you think so very ugly continued he addressing the boy with a smiling air will have the honor of driving you home while your coachman remains here to attend to the necessary repairs of your calash	181.6220167642474
As soon as that important business is concluded I will have a pair of my own horses harnessed to convey it direct to Madame Danglars	120.16497497688273
I dare not return with those dreadful horses said Madame de Villefort	40.9513523791487
You will see replied Monte Cristo that they will be as different as possible in the hands of Ali	32.07643445313574
With him they will be gentle and docile as lambs	1456.7988991734517
Ali had indeed given proof of this for approaching the animals who had been got upon their legs with considerable difficulty he rubbed their foreheads and nostrils with a sponge soaked in aromatic vinegar and wiped off the sweat and foam that covered their mouths	249.98872224298418
Then commencing a loud whistling noise he rubbed them well all over their bodies for several minutes then undisturbed by the noisy crowd collected round the broken carriage Ali quietly harnessed the pacified animals to the counts chariot took the reins in his hands and mounted the box when to the utter astonishment of those who had witnessed the ungovernable spirit and maddened speed of the same horses he was actually compelled to apply his whip in no very gentle manner before he could induce them to start and even then all that could be obtained from the celebrated dappled grays now changed into a couple of dull sluggish stupid brutes was a slow pottering pace kept up with so much difficulty that Madame de Villefort was more than two hours returning to her residence in the Faubourg SaintHonor	190.3252496372165
Scarcely had the first congratulations upon her marvellous escape been gone through when she wrote the following letter to Madame Danglars	109.08423405200575
Dear HermineI have just had a wonderful escape from the most imminent danger and I owe my safety to the very Count of Monte Cristo we were talking about yesterday but whom I little expected to see today	78.39836957444574
I remember how unmercifully I laughed at what I considered your eulogistic and exaggerated praises of him but I have now ample cause to admit that your enthusiastic description of this wonderful man fell far short of his merits	294.45058100545293
Your horses got as far as Ranelagh when they darted forward like mad things and galloped away at so fearful a rate that there seemed no other prospect for myself and my poor Edward but that of being dashed to pieces against the first object that impeded their progress when a strangelooking manan Arab a negro or a Nubian at least a black of some nation or otherat a signal from the count whose domestic he is suddenly seized and stopped the infuriated animals even at the risk of being trampled to death himself and certainly he must have had a most wonderful escape	243.44540901763924
The count then hastened to us and took us into his house where he speedily recalled my poor Edward to life	161.43243825804436
He sent us home in his own carriage	37.07308361240077
Yours will be returned to you tomorrow	62.68133954396665
You will find your horses in bad condition from the results of this accident they seem thoroughly stupefied as if sulky and vexed at having been conquered by man	340.38709237924866
The count however has commissioned me to assure you that two or three days rest with plenty of barley for their sole food during that time will bring them back to as fine that is as terrifying a condition as they were in yesterday	183.83697213949893
Adieu I can not return you many thanks for the drive of yesterday but after all I ought not to blame you for the misconduct of your horses more especially as it procured me the pleasure of an introduction to the Count of Monte Cristoand certainly that illustrious personage apart from the millions he is said to be so very anxious to dispose of seemed to me one of those curiously interesting problems I for one delight in solving at any risk even if it were to necessitate another drive to the Bois behind your horses	194.5329644966656
Edward endured the accident with miraculous couragehe did not utter a single cry but fell lifeless into my arms nor did a tear fall from his eyes after it was over	103.23922949585396
I doubt not you will consider these praises the result of blind maternal affection but there is a soul of iron in that delicate fragile body	356.25387832505595
Valentine sends many affectionate remembrances to your dear Eugnie	47.20105252389323
I embrace you with all my heart	11.139945721591285
Do pray contrive some means for me to meet the Count of Monte Cristo at your house	12.368762677822167
I must and will see him again	13.006802419361032
de Villefort promise to call on him and I hope the visit will be returned	52.96336893985239
That night the adventure at Auteuil was talked of everywhere	385.00105284811286
Albert related it to his mother ChteauRenaud recounted it at the Jockey Club and Debray detailed it at length in the salons of the minister even Beauchamp accorded twenty lines in his journal to the relation of the counts courage and gallantry thereby celebrating him as the greatest hero of the day in the eyes of all the feminine members of the aristocracy	171.63459147797982
Vast was the crowd of visitors and inquiring friends who left their names at the residence of Madame de Villefort with the design of renewing their visit at the right moment of hearing from her lips all the interesting circumstances of this most romantic adventure	115.67985149488189
de Villefort he fulfilled the predictions of Hlose to the letterdonned his dress suit drew on a pair of white gloves ordered the servants to attend the carriage dressed in their full livery and drove that same night to No	189.9672386278946
30 in the Avenue des Champslyses	1.8427831018505458
If the Count of Monte Cristo had been for a long time familiar with the ways of Parisian society he would have appreciated better the significance of the step which M	94.63135676103141
Standing well at court whether the king regnant was of the older or younger branch whether the government was doctrinaire liberal or conservative looked upon by all as a man of talent since those who have never experienced a political check are generally so regarded hated by many but warmly supported by others without being really liked by anybody M	446.0264007929254
de Villefort held a high position in the magistracy and maintained his eminence like a Harlay or a Mol	262.68548651748125
His drawingroom under the regenerating influence of a young wife and a daughter by his first marriage scarcely eighteen was still one of the wellregulated Paris salons where the worship of traditional customs and the observance of rigid etiquette were carefully maintained	333.45548723013627
A freezing politeness a strict fidelity to government principles a profound contempt for theories and theorists a deepseated hatred of idealitythese were the elements of private and public life displayed by M	844.831451510211
de Villefort was not only a magistrate he was almost a diplomatist	117.52425647014665
His relations with the former court of which he always spoke with dignity and respect made him respected by the new one and he knew so many things that not only was he always carefully considered but sometimes consulted	150.18135895675627
Perhaps this would not have been so had it been possible to get rid of M	62.036541862978375
de Villefort but like the feudal barons who rebelled against their sovereign he dwelt in an impregnable fortress	965.8156027421408
This fortress was his post as kings attorney all the advantages of which he exploited with marvellous skill and which he would not have resigned but to be made deputy and thus to replace neutrality by opposition	172.10805514485727
de Villefort made and returned very few visits	1376.029094077283
His wife visited for him and this was the received thing in the world where the weighty and multifarious occupations of the magistrate were accepted as an excuse for what was really only calculated pride a manifestation of professed superiorityin fact the application of the axiom Pretend to think well of yourself and the world will think well of you an axiom a hundred times more useful in society nowadays than that of the Greeks Know thyself a knowledge for which in our days we have substituted the less difficult and more advantageous science of knowing others	290.3617182476651
de Villefort was a powerful protector to his enemies he was a silent but bitter opponent for those who were neither the one nor the other he was a statue of the lawmade man	152.02289953238414
He had a haughty bearing a look either steady and impenetrable or insolently piercing and inquisitorial	1030.520380527459
Four successive revolutions had built and cemented the pedestal upon which his fortune was based	244.79894373778052
de Villefort had the reputation of being the least curious and the least wearisome man in France	139.15383599355167
He gave a ball every year at which he appeared for a quarter of an hour onlythat is to say fiveandforty minutes less than the king is visible at his balls	146.3097473023737
He was never seen at the theatres at concerts or in any place of public resort	459.76022672731
Occasionally but seldom he played at whist and then care was taken to select partners worthy of himsometimes they were ambassadors sometimes archbishops or sometimes a prince or a president or some dowager duchess	679.6494179502681
Such was the man whose carriage had just now stopped before the Count of Monte Cristos door	36.225976523901636
The valet de chambre announced M	199.16320281679555
de Villefort at the moment when the count leaning over a large table was tracing on a map the route from St	136.69278784546358
The procureur entered with the same grave and measured step he would have employed in entering a court of justice	152.3245699682748
He was the same man or rather the development of the same man whom we have heretofore seen as assistant attorney at Marseilles	178.51791325930105
Nature according to her way had made no deviation in the path he had marked out for himself	122.68736496061166
From being slender he had now become meagre once pale he was now yellow his deepset eyes were hollow and the gold spectacles shielding his eyes seemed to be an integral portion of his face	276.5216953510999
He dressed entirely in black with the exception of his white tie and his funeral appearance was only mitigated by the slight line of red ribbon which passed almost imperceptibly through his buttonhole and appeared like a streak of blood traced with a delicate brush	168.43903817018887
Although master of himself Monte Cristo scrutinized with irrepressible curiosity the magistrate whose salute he returned and who distrustful by habit and especially incredulous as to social prodigies was much more despised to look upon the noble stranger as Monte Cristo was already called as an adventurer in search of new fields or an escaped criminal rather than as a prince of the Holy See or a sultan of the Thousand and One Nights	278.78785463330485
Sir said Villefort in the squeaky tone assumed by magistrates in their oratorical periods and of which they can not or will not divest themselves in society sir the signal service which you yesterday rendered to my wife and son has made it a duty for me to offer you my thanks	210.96721951947117
I have come therefore to discharge this duty and to express to you my overwhelming gratitude	308.8642283626374
And as he said this the eye severe of the magistrate had lost nothing of its habitual arrogance	220.88868145003974
He spoke in a voice of the procureurgeneral with the rigid inflexibility of neck and shoulders which caused his flatterers to say as we have before observed that he was the living statue of the law	144.0218616540851
Monsieur replied the count with a chilling air I am very happy to have been the means of preserving a son to his mother for they say that the sentiment of maternity is the most holy of all and the good fortune which occurred to me monsieur might have enabled you to dispense with a duty which in its discharge confers an undoubtedly great honor for I am aware that M	125.06551752019244
de Villefort is not usually lavish of the favor which he now bestows on mea favor which however estimable is unequal to the satisfaction which I have in my own consciousness	313.63654710517795
Villefort astonished at this reply which he by no means expected started like a soldier who feels the blow levelled at him over the armor he wears and a curl of his disdainful lip indicated that from that moment he noted in the tablets of his brain that the Count of Monte Cristo was by no means a highly bred gentleman	164.70591463341032
He glanced around in order to seize on something on which the conversation might turn and seemed to fall easily on a topic	185.62443201636293
He saw the map which Monte Cristo had been examining when he entered and said	30.564461836079463
You seem geographically engaged sir It is a rich study for you who as I learn have seen as many lands as are delineated on this map	199.56081632582703
Yes sir replied the count I have sought to make of the human race taken in the mass what you practice every day on individualsa physiological study	240.66024826680726
I have believed it was much easier to descend from the whole to a part than to ascend from a part to the whole	140.03125154186554
It is an algebraic axiom which makes us proceed from a known to an unknown quantity and not from an unknown to a known but sit down sir I beg of you	153.82261490104713
Monte Cristo pointed to a chair which the procureur was obliged to take the trouble to move forwards himself while the count merely fell back into his own on which he had been kneeling when M	89.07747764200195
Thus the count was halfway turned towards his visitor having his back towards the window his elbow resting on the geographical chart which furnished the theme of conversation for the momenta conversation which assumed as in the case of the interviews with Danglars and Morcerf a turn analogous to the persons if not to the situation	161.68201991471673
Ah you philosophize replied Villefort after a moments silence during which like a wrestler who encounters a powerful opponent he took breath well sir really if like you I had nothing else to do I should seek a more amusing occupation	199.1811388053725
Why in truth sir was Monte Cristos reply man is but an ugly caterpillar for him who studies him through a solar microscope but you said I think that I had nothing else to do	157.98560071679606
Now really let me ask sir have youdo you believe you have anything to do or to speak in plain terms do you really think that what you do deserves being called anything	170.7219219573149
Villeforts astonishment redoubled at this second thrust so forcibly made by his strange adversary	431.30484534171444
It was a long time since the magistrate had heard a paradox so strong or rather to say the truth more exactly it was the first time he had ever heard of it	44.55512102916671
The procureur exerted himself to reply	827.774242528094
Sir he responded you are a stranger and I believe you say yourself that a portion of your life has been spent in Oriental countries so you are not aware how human justice so expeditious in barbarous countries takes with us a prudent and wellstudied course	260.8857071391057
Oh yesyes I do sir it is the pede claudo of the ancients	286.0445909212874
I know all that for it is with the justice of all countries especially that I have occupied myselfit is with the criminal procedure of all nations that I have compared natural justice and I must say sir that it is the law of primitive nations that is the law of retaliation that I have most frequently found to be according to the law of God	120.99832852462391
If this law were adopted sir said the procureur it would greatly simplify our legal codes and in that case the magistrates would not as you just observed have much to do	152.9080871752329
It may perhaps come to this in time observed Monte Cristo you know that human inventions march from the complex to the simple and simplicity is always perfection	391.8034423749451
In the meanwhile continued the magistrate our codes are in full force with all their contradictory enactments derived from Gallic customs Roman laws and Frank usages the knowledge of all which you will agree is not to be acquired without extended labor it needs tedious study to acquire this knowledge and when acquired a strong power of brain to retain it	449.54795578148565
I agree with you entirely sir but all that even you know with respect to the French code I know not only in reference to that code but as regards the codes of all nations	132.17725820828352
The English Turkish Japanese Hindu laws are as familiar to me as the French laws and thus I was right when I said to you that relatively you know that everything is relative sirthat relatively to what I have done you have very little to do but that relatively to all I have learned you have yet a great deal to learn	128.4807526444438
But with what motive have you learned all this inquired Villefort in astonishment	122.92737956619348
Really sir he observed I see that in spite of the reputation which you have acquired as a superior man you look at everything from the material and vulgar view of society beginning with man and ending with manthat is to say in the most restricted most narrow view which it is possible for human understanding to embrace	177.5779828737596
Pray sir explain yourself said Villefort more and more astonished I really donotunderstand youperfectly	455.590498315595
I say sir that with the eyes fixed on the social organization of nations you see only the springs of the machine and lose sight of the sublime workman who makes them act I say that you do not recognize before you and around you any but those officeholders whose commissions have been signed by a minister or king and that the men whom God has put above those officeholders ministers and kings by giving them a mission to follow out instead of a post to fillI say that they escape your narrow limited field of observation	204.25927612394358
It is thus that human weakness fails from its debilitated and imperfect organs	1242.7676808786107
Tobias took the angel who restored him to light for an ordinary young man	174.19624165303264
The nations took Attila who was doomed to destroy them for a conqueror similar to other conquerors and it was necessary for both to reveal their missions that they might be known and acknowledged one was compelled to say I am the angel of the Lord and the other I am the hammer of God in order that the divine essence in both might be revealed	133.22635213531973
Then said Villefort more and more amazed and really supposing he was speaking to a mystic or a madman you consider yourself as one of those extraordinary beings whom you have mentioned	123.41035002600636
And why not said Monte Cristo coldly	12.089116112676692
Your pardon sir replied Villefort quite astounded but you will excuse me if when I presented myself to you I was unaware that I should meet with a person whose knowledge and understanding so far surpass the usual knowledge and understanding of men	119.761687202796
It is not usual with us corrupted wretches of civilization to find gentlemen like yourself possessors as you are of immense fortuneat least so it is saidand I beg you to observe that I do not inquire I merely repeatit is not usual I say for such privileged and wealthy beings to waste their time in speculations on the state of society in philosophical reveries intended at best to console those whom fate has disinherited from the goods of this world	346.47547134217973
Really sir retorted the count have you attained the eminent situation in which you are without having admitted or even without having met with exceptions and do you never use your eyes which must have acquired so much finesse and certainty to divine at a glance the kind of man by whom you are confronted Should not a magistrate be not merely the best administrator of the law but the most crafty expounder of the chicanery of his profession a steel probe to search hearts a touchstone to try the gold which in each soul is mingled with more or less of alloy	233.90380001470763
Sir said Villefort upon my word you overcome me	101.02641182800167
I really never heard a person speak as you do	63.94047642673205
Because you remain eternally encircled in a round of general conditions and have never dared to raise your wings into those upper spheres which God has peopled with invisible or exceptional beings	317.0989748639806
And you allow then sir that spheres exist and that these marked and invisible beings mingle amongst us	1155.2138534669148
Why should they not Can you see the air you breathe and yet without which you could not for a moment exist	76.3006589102406
Then we do not see those beings to whom you allude	202.1168020855698
Yes we do you see them whenever God pleases to allow them to assume a material form	320.4082617224781
You touch them come in contact with them speak to them and they reply to you	86.50992198985965
Ah said Villefort smiling I confess I should like to be warned when one of these beings is in contact with me	67.95765738460743
You have been served as you desire monsieur for you were warned just now and I now again warn you	141.928248520554
Then you yourself are one of these marked beings	157.8169361394569
Yes monsieur I believe so for until now no man has found himself in a position similar to mine	127.93351790518892
The dominions of kings are limited either by mountains or rivers or a change of manners or an alteration of language	292.5485459919546
My kingdom is bounded only by the world for I am not an Italian or a Frenchman or a Hindu or an American or a SpaniardI am a cosmopolite	132.088217497356
No country can say it saw my birth	1104.2146763545416
God alone knows what country will see me die	54.80832592779169
I adopt all customs speak all languages	4075.8350502474714
You believe me to be a Frenchman for I speak French with the same facility and purity as yourself	156.6627818219665
Well Ali my Nubian believes me to be an Arab Bertuccio my steward takes me for a Roman Hayde my slave thinks me a Greek	248.07068147353274
You may therefore comprehend that being of no country asking no protection from any government acknowledging no man as my brother not one of the scruples that arrest the powerful or the obstacles which paralyze the weak paralyzes or arrests me	428.5270153787093
I have only two adversariesI will not say two conquerors for with perseverance I subdue even themthey are time and distance	1030.4815362892848
There is a third and the most terriblethat is my condition as a mortal being	257.95866117059967
This alone can stop me in my onward career before I have attained the goal at which I aim for all the rest I have reduced to mathematical terms	277.8122540251238
What men call the chances of fatenamely ruin change circumstancesI have fully anticipated and if any of these should overtake me yet it will not overwhelm me	346.28033412559256
Unless I die I shall always be what I am and therefore it is that I utter the things you have never heard even from the mouths of kingsfor kings have need and other persons have fear of you	131.53459681271713
For who is there who does not say to himself in a society as incongruously organized as ours Perhaps some day I shall have to do with the kings attorney	89.06408568340224
But can you not say that sir The moment you become an inhabitant of France you are naturally subjected to the French law	122.22820152803207
I know it sir replied Monte Cristo but when I visit a country I begin to study by all the means which are available the men from whom I may have anything to hope or to fear till I know them as well as perhaps better than they know themselves	85.49494149013601
It follows from this that the kings attorney be he who he may with whom I should have to deal would assuredly be more embarrassed than I should	121.19522636097714
That is to say replied Villefort with hesitation that human nature being weak every man according to your creed has committed faults	291.05963177820854
Faults or crimes responded Monte Cristo with a negligent air	34.61935270240994
And that you alone amongst the men whom you do not recognize as your brothersfor you have said so observed Villefort in a tone that faltered somewhatyou alone are perfect	183.5530836882694
No not perfect was the counts reply only impenetrable that s all	604.3178279917604
But let us leave off this strain sir if the tone of it is displeasing to you I am no more disturbed by your justice than are you by my secondsight	114.1151422416557
No noby no means said Villefort who was afraid of seeming to abandon his ground	73.09165948855413
No by your brilliant and almost sublime conversation you have elevated me above the ordinary level we no longer talk we rise to dissertation	485.29571706291404
But you know how the theologians in their collegiate chairs and philosophers in their controversies occasionally say cruel truths let us suppose for the moment that we are theologizing in a social way or even philosophically and I will say to you rude as it may seem My brother you sacrifice greatly to pride you may be above others but above you there is God	350.8404708929238
Above us all sir was Monte Cristos response in a tone and with an emphasis so deep that Villefort involuntarily shuddered	128.41731028802826
I have my pride for menserpents always ready to threaten everyone who would pass without crushing them under foot	489.70742936718506
But I lay aside that pride before God who has taken me from nothing to make me what I am	41.20724774566287
Then count I admire you said Villefort who for the first time in this strange conversation used the aristocratic form to the unknown personage whom until now he had only called monsieur	130.26004566605755
Yes and I say to you if you are really strong really superior really pious or impenetrable which you were right in saying amounts to the same thingthen be proud sir for that is the characteristic of predominance	272.19805034660845
Yet you have unquestionably some ambition	2985.24241480885
I too as happens to every man once in his life have been taken by Satan into the highest mountain in the earth and when there he showed me all the kingdoms of the world and as he said before so said he to me Child of earth what wouldst thou have to make thee adore me I reflected long for a gnawing ambition had long preyed upon me and then I replied ListenI have always heard of Providence and yet I have never seen him or anything that resembles him or which can make me believe that he exists	144.4071229081408
I wish to be Providence myself for I feel that the most beautiful noblest most sublime thing in the world is to recompense and punish	153.3986637213863
Satan bowed his head and groaned	2088.099477083258
You mistake he said Providence does exist only you have never seen him because the child of God is as invisible as the parent	109.8050430556644
You have seen nothing that resembles him because he works by secret springs and moves by hidden ways	1111.326458820497
All I can do for you is to make you one of the agents of that Providence	61.35821254667512
I may sacrifice my soul but what matters it added Monte Cristo	82.4910822568573
If the thing were to do again I would again do it	75.70436621724986
Villefort looked at Monte Cristo with extreme amazement	91.71673422800812
Count he inquired have you any relations	793.7554810753611
No sir I am alone in the world	8.435571062629695
Because then you might witness a spectacle calculated to break down your pride	608.5231956422366
You say you fear nothing but death	207.4451568875429
I did not say that I feared it I only said that death alone could check the execution of my plans	131.1278206924461
My end will be achieved before I grow old	407.92508538829543
I have been nearly mad and you know the axiomnon bis in idem	527.2234134282431
It is an axiom of criminal law and consequently you understand its full application	396.32322655273697
Sir continued Villefort there is something to fear besides death old age and madness	159.8228990186576
For instance there is apoplexythat lightningstroke which strikes but does not destroy you and yet which brings everything to an end	394.46491683528234
You are still yourself as now and yet you are yourself no longer you who like Ariel verge on the angelic are but an inert mass which like Caliban verges on the brutal and this is called in human tongues as I tell you neither more nor less than apoplexy	289.87633598039645
Come if so you will count and continue this conversation at my house any day you may be willing to see an adversary capable of understanding and anxious to refute you and I will show you my father M	93.91741669294912
Noirtier de Villefort one of the most fiery Jacobins of the French Revolution that is to say he had the most remarkable audacity seconded by a most powerful organizationa man who has not perhaps like yourself seen all the kingdoms of the earth but who has helped to overturn one of the greatest in fact a man who believed himself like you one of the envoys not of God but of a supreme being not of Providence but of fate	137.39658197664968
Well sir the rupture of a bloodvessel on the lobe of the brain has destroyed all this not in a day not in an hour but in a second	90.64601623089912
Noirtier who on the previous night was the old Jacobin the old senator the old Carbonaro laughing at the guillotine the cannon and the daggerM	429.22411771723034
Noirtier for whom France was a vast chessboard from which pawns rooks knights and queens were to disappear so that the king was checkmatedM	427.1393673642826
Noirtier the redoubtable was the next morning poor M	275.88055410858124
Noirtier the helpless old man at the tender mercies of the weakest creature in the household that is his grandchild Valentine a dumb and frozen carcass in fact living painlessly on that time may be given for his frame to decompose without his consciousness of its decay	418.0840722073163
Alas sir said Monte Cristo this spectacle is neither strange to my eye nor my thought	214.71948946352617
I am something of a physician and have like my fellows sought more than once for the soul in living and in dead matter yet like Providence it has remained invisible to my eyes although present to my heart	257.086619111107
A hundred writers since Socrates Seneca St	44010.519831581274
Augustine and Gall have made in verse and prose the comparison you have made and yet I can well understand that a fathers sufferings may effect great changes in the mind of a son	196.73321785052516
I will call on you sir since you bid me contemplate for the advantage of my pride this terrible spectacle which must have been so great a source of sorrow to your family	66.5141940621757
It would have been so unquestionably had not God given me so large a compensation	525.7894770793655
In contrast with the old man who is dragging his way to the tomb are two children just entering into lifeValentine the daughter by my first wifeMademoiselle Rene de SaintMranand Edward the boy whose life you have this day saved	238.66204244011968
And what is your deduction from this compensation sir inquired Monte Cristo	64.83408223107692
My deduction is replied Villefort that my father led away by his passions has committed some fault unknown to human justice but marked by the justice of God	112.21624191077153
That God desirous in his mercy to punish but one person has visited this justice on him alone	169.02604942031365
Monte Cristo with a smile on his lips uttered in the depths of his soul a groan which would have made Villefort fly had he but heard it	64.75756895684869
Adieu sir said the magistrate who had risen from his seat I leave you bearing a remembrance of youa remembrance of esteem which I hope will not be disagreeable to you when you know me better for I am not a man to bore my friends as you will learn	69.55280928468294
Besides you have made an eternal friend of Madame de Villefort	19.040908869485495
The count bowed and contented himself with seeing Villefort to the door of his cabinet the procureur being escorted to his carriage by two footmen who on a signal from their master followed him with every mark of attention	87.86539735496818
When he had gone Monte Cristo breathed a profound sigh and said	89.55377167583623
Enough of this poison let me now seek the antidote	260.8356596574032
Then sounding his bell he said to Ali who entered	28.307648438064252
I am going to madames chamberhave the carriage ready at one oclock	346.8035186732635
It will be recollected that the new or rather old acquaintances of the Count of Monte Cristo residing in the Rue Meslay were no other than Maximilian Julie and Emmanuel	48.80201792836306
The very anticipations of delight to be enjoyed in his forthcoming visitsthe bright pure gleam of heavenly happiness it diffused over the almost deadly warfare in which he had voluntarily engaged illumined his whole countenance with a look of ineffable joy and calmness as immediately after Villeforts departure his thoughts flew back to the cheering prospect before him of tasting at least a brief respite from the fierce and stormy passions of his mind	309.7019148149808
Even Ali who had hastened to obey the Counts summons went forth from his masters presence in charmed amazement at the unusual animation and pleasure depicted on features ordinarily so stern and cold while as though dreading to put to flight the agreeable ideas hovering over his patrons meditations whatever they were the faithful Nubian walked on tiptoe towards the door holding his breath lest its faintest sound should dissipate his masters happy reverie	412.0197430248348
It was noon and Monte Cristo had set apart one hour to be passed in the apartments of Hayde as though his oppressed spirit could not all at once admit the feeling of pure and unmixed joy but required a gradual succession of calm and gentle emotions to prepare his mind to receive full and perfect happiness in the same manner as ordinary natures demand to be inured by degrees to the reception of strong or violent sensations	181.38348161606797
The young Greek as we have already said occupied apartments wholly unconnected with those of the count	224.87990720046463
The rooms had been fitted up in strict accordance with Oriental ideas the floors were covered with the richest carpets Turkey could produce the walls hung with brocaded silk of the most magnificent designs and texture while around each chamber luxurious divans were placed with piles of soft and yielding cushions that needed only to be arranged at the pleasure or convenience of such as sought repose	480.3677988171717
Hayde had three French maids and one who was a Greek	62.143884082359115
The first three remained constantly in a small waitingroom ready to obey the summons of a small golden bell or to receive the orders of the Romaic slave who knew just enough French to be able to transmit her mistresss wishes to the three other waitingwomen the latter had received most peremptory instructions from Monte Cristo to treat Hayde with all the deference they would observe to a queen	178.15502504803732
The young girl herself generally passed her time in the chamber at the farther end of her apartments	60.081064654262924
This was a sort of boudoir circular and lighted only from the roof which consisted of rosecolored glass	455.9686561559041
Hayde was reclining upon soft downy cushions covered with blue satin spotted with silver her head supported by one of her exquisitely moulded arms rested on the divan immediately behind her while the other was employed in adjusting to her lips the coral tube of a rich narghile through whose flexible pipe she drew the smoke fragrant by its passage through perfumed water	230.66357990950036
Her attitude though perfectly natural for an Eastern woman would in a European have been deemed too full of coquettish straining after effect	634.2457127291459
Her dress which was that of the women of Epirus consisted of a pair of white satin trousers embroidered with pink roses displaying feet so exquisitely formed and so delicately fair that they might well have been taken for Parian marble had not the eye been undeceived by their movements as they constantly shifted in and out of a pair of little slippers with upturned toes beautifully ornamented with gold and pearls	255.91966605910784
She wore a blue and whitestriped vest with long open sleeves trimmed with silver loops and buttons of pearls and a sort of bodice which closing only from the centre to the waist exhibited the whole of the ivory throat and upper part of the bosom it was fastened with three magnificent diamond clasps	237.66520961589262
The junction of the bodice and drawers was entirely concealed by one of the manycolored scarves whose brilliant hues and rich silken fringe have rendered them so precious in the eyes of Parisian belles	231.50406935852618
Tilted on one side of her head she had a small cap of goldcolored silk embroidered with pearls while on the other a purple rose mingled its glowing colors with the luxuriant masses of her hair of which the blackness was so intense that it was tinged with blue	148.5046135117887
The extreme beauty of the countenance that shone forth in loveliness that mocked the vain attempts of dress to augment it was peculiarly and purely Grecian there were the large dark melting eyes the finely formed nose the coral lips and pearly teeth that belonged to her race and country	429.0581782016257
And to complete the whole Hayde was in the very springtide and fulness of youthful charmsshe had not yet numbered more than nineteen or twenty summers	404.41790561881476
Monte Cristo summoned the Greek attendant and bade her inquire whether it would be agreeable to her mistress to receive his visit	103.30405735395038
Haydes only reply was to direct her servant by a sign to withdraw the tapestried curtain that hung before the door of her boudoir the framework of the opening thus made serving as a sort of border to the graceful tableau presented by the young girls picturesque attitude and appearance	173.4590788581729
As Monte Cristo approached she leaned upon the elbow of the arm that held the narghile and extending to him her other hand said with a smile of captivating sweetness in the sonorous language spoken by the women of Athens and Sparta	105.4268704963071
Why demand permission ere you enter Are you no longer my master or have I ceased to be your slave	78.51349814516865
Hayde said he you well know	52.04025458320492
Why do you address me so coldlyso distantly asked the young Greek	531.0931477455708
Have I by any means displeased you Oh if so punish me as you will but do notdo not speak to me in tones and manner so formal and constrained	202.8082975145479
Hayde replied the count you know that you are now in France and are free	30.865777004005196
Free to do what asked the young girl	5.77427853493335
Leave you Why should I leave you	13.273553370640629
That is not for me to say but we are now about to mix in societyto visit and be visited	326.82410814049916
I do nt wish to see anybody but you	140.52067633650466
And should you see one whom you could prefer I would not be so unjust	103.23168681234617
I have never seen anyone I preferred to you and I have never loved anyone but you and my father	28.483260538634852
My poor child replied Monte Cristo that is merely because your father and myself are the only men who have ever talked to you	43.67739965369969
I do nt want anybody else to talk to me	30.097822429188067
My father said I was his joyyou style me your loveand both of you have called me my child	473.6984292319488
Do you remember your father Hayde	2115.0568838197405
He is here and here said she touching her eyes and her heart	29.881910721413984
And where am I inquired Monte Cristo laughingly	103.51904991378377
You cried she with tones of thrilling tenderness you are everywhere Monte Cristo took the delicate hand of the young girl in his and was about to raise it to his lips when the simple child of nature hastily withdrew it and presented her cheek	79.80924938181106
You now understand Hayde said the count that from this moment you are absolutely free that here you exercise unlimited sway and are at liberty to lay aside or continue the costume of your country as it may suit your inclination	162.43110646353895
Within this mansion you are absolute mistress of your actions and may go abroad or remain in your apartments as may seem most agreeable to you	171.3730510284449
A carriage waits your orders and Ali and Myrtho will accompany you whithersoever you desire to go	259.58715710182406
There is but one favor I would entreat of you	124.65497212669713
Guard carefully the secret of your birth	248.38852278924267
Make no allusion to the past nor upon any occasion be induced to pronounce the names of your illustrious father or illfated mother	276.4617879305657
I have already told you my lord that I shall see no one	22.276569778737542
It is possible Hayde that so perfect a seclusion though conformable with the habits and customs of the East may not be practicable in Paris	213.10695327927735
Endeavor then to accustom yourself to our manner of living in these northern climes as you did to those of Rome Florence Milan and Madrid it may be useful to you one of these days whether you remain here or return to the East	156.32823663778598
The young girl raised her tearful eyes towards Monte Cristo as she said with touching earnestness Whether we return to the East you mean to say my lord do you not	87.08174093666716
My child returned Monte Cristo you know full well that whenever we part it will be no fault or wish of mine the tree forsakes not the flowerthe flower falls from the tree	314.8656070341784
My lord replied Hayde I never will leave you for I am sure I could not exist without you	42.68636567236608
My poor girl in ten years I shall be old and you will be still young	28.360112998842165
My father had a long white beard but I loved him he was sixty years old but to me he was handsomer than all the fine youths I saw	110.88127581376041
Then tell me Hayde do you believe you shall be able to accustom yourself to our present mode of life	62.77911889011306
Then what do you fear my lord	42.642782899133415
In the morning I shall rejoice in the prospect of your coming and in the evening dwell with delight on the happiness I have enjoyed in your presence then too when alone I can call forth mighty pictures of the past see vast horizons bounded only by the towering mountains of Pindus and Olympus	371.70430966373004
Oh believe me that when three great passions such as sorrow love and gratitude fill the heart ennui can find no place	389.71750028711733
You are a worthy daughter of Epirus Hayde and your charming and poetical ideas prove well your descent from that race of goddesses who claim your country as their birthplace	641.2123073373397
Depend on my care to see that your youth is not blighted or suffered to pass away in ungenial solitude and of this be well assured that if you love me as a father I love you as a child	98.16909701726543
The love I have for you is very different from the love I had for my father	78.55006813588273
My father died but I did not die	17.788253088490464
If you were to die I should die too	55.01944863100703
The count with a smile of profound tenderness extended his hand and she carried it to her lips	34.00354778390474
Monte Cristo thus attuned to the interview he proposed to hold with Morrel and his family departed murmuring as he went these lines of Pindar Youth is a flower of which love is the fruit happy is he who after having watched its silent growth is permitted to gather and call it his own	246.59425420323117
The carriage was prepared according to orders and stepping lightly into it the count drove off at his usual rapid pace	178.4644789193726
In a very few minutes the count reached No	65.33078253254462
The house was of white stone and in a small court before it were two small beds full of beautiful flowers	130.1548415409478
In the concierge that opened the gate the count recognized Cocles but as he had but one eye and that eye had become somewhat dim in the course of nine years Cocles did not recognize the count	84.24066126569932
The carriages that drove up to the door were compelled to turn to avoid a fountain that played in a basin of rockworkan ornament that had excited the jealousy of the whole quarter and had gained for the place the appellation of The Little Versailles	187.13661830462235
It is needless to add that there were gold and silver fish in the basin	126.54284873732205
The house with kitchens and cellars below had above the ground floor two stories and attics	563.51256519966
The whole of the property consisting of an immense workshop two pavilions at the bottom of the garden and the garden itself had been purchased by Emmanuel who had seen at a glance that he could make of it a profitable speculation	99.26856280015562
He had reserved the house and half the garden and building a wall between the garden and the workshops had let them upon lease with the pavilions at the bottom of the garden	126.3823617536437
So that for a trifling sum he was as well lodged and as perfectly shut out from observation as the inhabitants of the finest mansion in the Faubourg St	136.11154807475017
The breakfastroom was finished in oak the salon in mahogany and the furnishings were of blue velvet the bedroom was in citronwood and green damask	359.4821735579841
There was a study for Emmanuel who never studied and a musicroom for Julie who never played	442.1729654475893
The whole of the second story was set apart for Maximilian it was precisely similar to his sisters apartments except that for the breakfastparlor he had a billiardroom where he received his friends	228.4474623831391
He was superintending the grooming of his horse and smoking his cigar at the entrance of the garden when the counts carriage stopped at the gate	36.56829162366606
Cocles opened the gate and Baptistin springing from the box inquired whether Monsieur and Madame Herbault and Monsieur Maximilian Morrel would see his excellency the Count of Monte Cristo	169.24145310725672
The Count of Monte Cristo cried Morrel throwing away his cigar and hastening to the carriage I should think we would see him	72.69774887214123
Ah a thousand thanks count for not having forgotten your promise	95.64377754893464
And the young officer shook the counts hand so warmly that Monte Cristo could not be mistaken as to the sincerity of his joy and he saw that he had been expected with impatience and was received with pleasure	41.33619733325595
Come come said Maximilian I will serve as your guide such a man as you are ought not to be introduced by a servant	55.31099300436773
My sister is in the garden plucking the dead roses my brother is reading his two papers la Presse and les Dbats within six steps of her for wherever you see Madame Herbault you have only to look within a circle of four yards and you will find M	270.97313153434624
Emmanuel and reciprocally as they say at the Polytechnic School	578.6951641851687
At the sound of their steps a young woman of twenty to fiveandtwenty dressed in a silk morning gown and busily engaged in plucking the dead leaves off a noisette rosetree raised her head	357.2982829834139
This was Julie who had become as the clerk of the house of Thomson   French had predicted Madame Emmanuel Herbault	95.41751636994984
She uttered a cry of surprise at the sight of a stranger and Maximilian began to laugh	35.939438081740235
Do nt disturb yourself Julie said he	5.564358968546716
The count has only been two or three days in Paris but he already knows what a fashionable woman of the Marais is and if he does not you will show him	95.75424477671226
Ah monsieur returned Julie it is treason in my brother to bring you thus but he never has any regard for his poor sister	147.89656959100844
An old man who was digging busily at one of the beds stuck his spade in the earth and approached cap in hand striving to conceal a quid of tobacco he had just thrust into his cheek	208.8107614995973
A few locks of gray mingled with his hair which was still thick and matted while his bronzed features and determined glance well suited an old sailor who had braved the heat of the equator and the storms of the tropics	151.56605225900978
I think you hailed me Mademoiselle Julie said he	142.15770570005608
Penelon had still preserved the habit of calling his masters daughter Mademoiselle Julie and had never been able to change the name to Madame Herbault	107.09339531708169
Penelon replied Julie go and inform M	327.4403104874713
Emmanuel of this gentlemans visit and Maximilian will conduct him to the salon	52.482611068840555
Then turning to Monte CristoI hope you will permit me to leave you for a few minutes continued she and without awaiting any reply disappeared behind a clump of trees and escaped to the house by a lateral alley	89.39019048145099
I am sorry to see observed Monte Cristo to Morrel that I cause no small disturbance in your house	151.36124038632084
Look there said Maximilian laughing there is her husband changing his jacket for a coat	288.995419803962
I assure you you are well known in the Rue Meslay	19.08095585757466
Your family appears to be a very happy one said the count as if speaking to himself	52.36447686932613
Oh yes I assure you count they want nothing that can render them happy they are young and cheerful they are tenderly attached to each other and with twentyfive thousand francs a year they fancy themselves as rich as Rothschild	134.42715900725923
Fiveandtwenty thousand francs is not a large sum however replied Monte Cristo with a tone so sweet and gentle that it went to Maximilians heart like the voice of a father but they will not be content with that	52.034814893882235
Your brotherinlaw is a barrister a doctor	168.4606697591358
He was a merchant monsieur and had succeeded to the business of my poor father	44.133186952372775
Morrel at his death left 500000 francs which were divided between my sister and myself for we were his only children	152.18537744476717
Her husband who when he married her had no other patrimony than his noble probity his firstrate ability and his spotless reputation wished to possess as much as his wife	261.59933857729607
He labored and toiled until he had amassed 250000 francs six years sufficed to achieve this object	260.20320001166635
Oh I assure you sir it was a touching spectacle to see these young creatures destined by their talents for higher stations toiling together and through their unwillingness to change any of the customs of their paternal house taking six years to accomplish what less scrupulous people would have effected in two or three	272.2042220298303
Marseilles resounded with their wellearned praises	8282.026439809215
At last one day Emmanuel came to his wife who had just finished making up the accounts	49.89862562440183
Julie said he to her Cocles has just given me the last rouleau of a hundred francs that completes the 250000 francs we had fixed as the limits of our gains	163.54679877241307
Can you content yourself with the small fortune which we shall possess for the future Listen to me	90.29070480611651
Our house transacts business to the amount of a million a year from which we derive an income of 40000 francs	83.44497145667236
We can dispose of the business if we please in an hour for I have received a letter from M	45.929964672922374
Delaunay in which he offers to purchase the goodwill of the house to unite with his own for 300000 francs	66.63293012392913
Advise me what I had better do	899.9606120023666
Emmanuel returned my sister the house of Morrel can only be carried on by a Morrel	105.23936796633218
Is it not worth 300000 francs to save our fathers name from the chances of evil fortune and failure	89.59888790784231
I thought so replied Emmanuel but I wished to have your advice	40.76234825121633
This is my counselOur accounts are made up and our bills paid all we have to do is to stop the issue of any more and close our office	158.80278058463904
It was three oclock at a quarter past a merchant presented himself to insure two ships it was a clear profit of 15000 francs	130.74791212141605
Monsieur said Emmanuel have the goodness to address yourself to M	108.90025696491564
How long inquired the astonished merchant	5804.548392019127
A quarter of an hour was the reply	87.51088743709194
And this is the reason monsieur continued Maximilian of my sister and brotherinlaw having only 25000 francs a year	122.0191497241654
Maximilian had scarcely finished his story during which the counts heart had swelled within him when Emmanuel entered wearing a hat and coat	216.62298011125074
He saluted the count with the air of a man who is aware of the rank of his guest then after having led Monte Cristo around the little garden he returned to the house	30.088365155838655
A large vase of Japan porcelain filled with flowers that loaded the air with their perfume stood in the salon	157.16273827003945
Julie suitably dressed and her hair arranged she had accomplished this feat in less than ten minutes received the count on his entrance	79.82116092356529
The songs of the birds were heard in an aviary hard by and the branches of laburnums and rose acacias formed an exquisite framework to the blue velvet curtains	337.7742091290799
Everything in this charming retreat from the warble of the birds to the smile of the mistress breathed tranquillity and repose	172.62767731234337
The count had felt the influence of this happiness from the moment he entered the house and he remained silent and pensive forgetting that he was expected to renew the conversation which had ceased after the first salutations had been exchanged	83.67864632479976
The silence became almost painful when by a violent effort tearing himself from his pleasing reverie	127.57181849846877
Madame said he at length I pray you to excuse my emotion which must astonish you who are only accustomed to the happiness I meet here but contentment is so new a sight to me that I could never be weary of looking at yourself and your husband	118.11220221506876
We are very happy monsieur replied Julie but we have also known unhappiness and few have ever undergone more bitter sufferings than ourselves	483.61021853767005
The counts features displayed an expression of the most intense curiosity	37.52701970799631
Oh all this is a family history as ChteauRenaud told you the other day observed Maximilian	170.56716537952389
This humble picture would have but little interest for you accustomed as you are to behold the pleasures and the misfortunes of the wealthy and industrious but such as we are we have experienced bitter sorrows	217.03542960256758
And God has poured balm into your wounds as he does into those of all who are in affliction said Monte Cristo inquiringly	66.94784008519095
Yes count returned Julie we may indeed say he has for he has done for us what he grants only to his chosen he sent us one of his angels	162.9114049045686
The counts cheeks became scarlet and he coughed in order to have an excuse for putting his handkerchief to his mouth	66.21768905803704
Those born to wealth and who have the means of gratifying every wish said Emmanuel know not what is the real happiness of life just as those who have been tossed on the stormy waters of the ocean on a few frail planks can alone realize the blessings of fair weather	169.22319094648546
Monte Cristo rose and without making any answer for the tremulousness of his voice would have betrayed his emotion walked up and down the apartment with a slow step	59.484011087112385
Our magnificence makes you smile count said Maximilian who had followed him with his eyes	22.142793951308875
No no returned Monte Cristo pale as death pressing one hand on his heart to still its throbbings while with the other he pointed to a crystal cover beneath which a silken purse lay on a black velvet cushion	120.15271367395421
I was wondering what could be the significance of this purse with the paper at one end and the large diamond at the other	77.44549046209305
Count replied Maximilian with an air of gravity those are our most precious family treasures	193.68693809227045
The stone seems very brilliant answered the count	48.29461823121644
Oh my brother does not allude to its value although it has been estimated at 100000 francs he means that the articles contained in this purse are the relics of the angel I spoke of just now	211.57905777809933
This I do not comprehend and yet I may not ask for an explanation madame replied Monte Cristo bowing	40.38454753712865
Pardon me I had no intention of committing an indiscretion	563.7079857728223
Indiscretionoh you make us happy by giving us an excuse for expatiating on this subject	113.9184384794784
If we wanted to conceal the noble action this purse commemorates we should not expose it thus to view	391.7318954968465
Oh would we could relate it everywhere and to everyone so that the emotion of our unknown benefactor might reveal his presence	191.5819392524658
Ah really said Monte Cristo in a halfstifled voice	141.08969676610872
Monsieur returned Maximilian raising the glass cover and respectfully kissing the silken purse this has touched the hand of a man who saved my father from suicide us from ruin and our name from shame and disgracea man by whose matchless benevolence we poor children doomed to want and wretchedness can at present hear everyone envying our happy lot	454.1415004853441
This letter as he spoke Maximilian drew a letter from the purse and gave it to the countthis letter was written by him the day that my father had taken a desperate resolution and this diamond was given by the generous unknown to my sister as her dowry	73.73224322362468
Monte Cristo opened the letter and read it with an indescribable feeling of delight	26.833099678453546
It was the letter written as our readers know to Julie and signed Sinbad the Sailor	191.23887187489777
Unknown you say is the man who rendered you this serviceunknown to you	198.7873997933243
Yes we have never had the happiness of pressing his hand continued Maximilian	152.78466259604616
We have supplicated Heaven in vain to grant us this favor but the whole affair has had a mysterious meaning that we can not comprehendwe have been guided by an invisible handa hand as powerful as that of an enchanter	124.07244178979222
Oh cried Julie I have not lost all hope of some day kissing that hand as I now kiss the purse which he has touched	118.3643943834748
Four years ago Penelon was at TriestePenelon count is the old sailor you saw in the garden and who from quartermaster has become gardenerPenelon when he was at Trieste saw on the quay an Englishman who was on the point of embarking on board a yacht and he recognized him as the person who called on my father the fifth of June 1829 and who wrote me this letter on the fifth of September	140.7744916537772
He felt convinced of his identity but he did not venture to address him	66.2878627984106
An Englishman said Monte Cristo who grew uneasy at the attention with which Julie looked at him	94.68268744784834
Yes replied Maximilian an Englishman who represented himself as the confidential clerk of the house of Thomson   French at Rome	26.168062142470728
It was this that made me start when you said the other day at M	55.53049716370312
That happened as I told you in 1829	138.55383791357391
For Gods sake tell me did you know this Englishman	70.05549742824607
But you tell me also that the house of Thomson   French have constantly denied having rendered you this service	167.16958021662305
Then is it not probable that this Englishman may be someone who grateful for a kindness your father had shown him and which he himself had forgotten has taken this method of requiting the obligation	126.8243614346692
Everything is possible in this affair even a miracle	129.49730849771692
What was his name asked Monte Cristo	2.431267359150725
He gave no other name answered Julie looking earnestly at the count than that at the end of his letterSinbad the Sailor	111.42208481527533
Which is evidently not his real name but a fictitious one	141.8513537032746
Then noticing that Julie was struck with the sound of his voice	23.232732543572162
Tell me continued he was he not about my height perhaps a little taller with his chin imprisoned as it were in a high cravat his coat closely buttoned up and constantly taking out his pencil	250.9706954106504
Oh do you then know him cried Julie whose eyes sparkled with joy	39.53780074247815
No returned Monte Cristo I only guessed	232.9095024765964
I knew a Lord Wilmore who was constantly doing actions of this kind	191.31701003196733
He was an eccentric being and did not believe in the existence of gratitude	74.29856395773248
Oh Heaven exclaimed Julie clasping her hands in what did he believe then	53.22045908978203
He did not credit it at the period which I knew him said Monte Cristo touched to the heart by the accents of Julies voice but perhaps since then he has had proofs that gratitude does exist	148.1147926931842
And do you know this gentleman monsieur inquired Emmanuel	233.04554893117276
Oh if you do know him cried Julie can you tell us where he iswhere we can find him MaximilianEmmanuelif we do but discover him he must believe in the gratitude of the heart	118.0292200933828
Monte Cristo felt tears start into his eyes and he again walked hastily up and down the room	23.58507650172196
In the name of Heaven said Maximilian if you know anything of him tell us what it is	39.79608052974926
Alas cried Monte Cristo striving to repress his emotion if Lord Wilmore was your unknown benefactor I fear you will never see him again	67.45169051272133
I parted from him two years ago at Palermo and he was then on the point of setting out for the most remote regions so that I fear he will never return	76.99006182528412
Oh monsieur this is cruel of you said Julie much affected and the young ladys eyes swam with tears	88.90862382921749
Madame replied Monte Cristo gravely and gazing earnestly on the two liquid pearls that trickled down Julies cheeks had Lord Wilmore seen what I now see he would become attached to life for the tears you shed would reconcile him to mankind and he held out his hand to Julie who gave him hers carried away by the look and accent of the count	132.64331823110095
But continued she Lord Wilmore had a family or friends he must have known someone can we not	99.86317263125129
Oh it is useless to inquire returned the count perhaps after all he was not the man you seek for	134.85630130119543
He was my friend he had no secrets from me and if this had been so he would have confided in me	87.79973526924965
Nothing that would lead you to suppose	48.206569796401936
And yet you spoke of him at once	41.28094317679733
Ah in such a case one supposes	5465.428655364476
Sister sister said Maximilian coming to the counts aid monsieur is quite right	139.82363168832202
Recollect what our excellent father so often told us It was no Englishman that thus saved us	187.0394814865042
What did your father tell you M	30.18949656864878
My father thought that this action had been miraculously performedhe believed that a benefactor had arisen from the grave to save us	357.9604885746974
Oh it was a touching superstition monsieur and although I did not myself believe it I would not for the world have destroyed my fathers faith	154.90964729348462
How often did he muse over it and pronounce the name of a dear frienda friend lost to him forever and on his deathbed when the near approach of eternity seemed to have illumined his mind with supernatural light this thought which had until then been but a doubt became a conviction and his last words were Maximilian it was Edmond Dants	207.7702915526745
At these words the counts paleness which had for some time been increasing became alarming he could not speak he looked at his watch like a man who has forgotten the hour said a few hurried words to Madame Herbault and pressing the hands of Emmanuel and MaximilianMadame said he I trust you will allow me to visit you occasionally I value your friendship and feel grateful to you for your welcome for this is the first time for many years that I have thus yielded to my feelings and he hastily quitted the apartment	93.64274934192706
This Count of Monte Cristo is a strange man said Emmanuel	24.26027575350044
Yes answered Maximilian but I feel sure he has an excellent heart and that he likes us	114.74458327800238
His voice went to my heart observed Julie and two or three times I fancied that I had heard it before	63.5348466737932
About twothirds of the way along the Faubourg SaintHonor and in the rear of one of the most imposing mansions in this rich neighborhood where the various houses vie with each other for elegance of design and magnificence of construction extended a large garden where the widespreading chestnuttrees raised their heads high above the walls in a solid rampart and with the coming of every spring scattered a shower of delicate pink and white blossoms into the large stone vases that stood upon the two square pilasters of a curiously wrought iron gate that dated from the time of Louis XIII	236.79825528538032
This noble entrance however in spite of its striking appearance and the graceful effect of the geraniums planted in the two vases as they waved their variegated leaves in the wind and charmed the eye with their scarlet bloom had fallen into utter disuse	260.660584125609
The proprietors of the mansion had many years before thought it best to confine themselves to the possession of the house itself with its thickly planted courtyard opening into the Faubourg SaintHonor and to the garden shut in by this gate which formerly communicated with a fine kitchengarden of about an acre	167.38229113349476
For the demon of speculation drew a line or in other words projected a street at the farther side of the kitchengarden	206.6014394992725
The street was laid out a name was chosen and posted up on an iron plate but before construction was begun it occurred to the possessor of the property that a handsome sum might be obtained for the ground then devoted to fruits and vegetables by building along the line of the proposed street and so making it a branch of communication with the Faubourg SaintHonor itself one of the most important thoroughfares in the city of Paris	151.87419232327207
In matters of speculation however though man proposes yet money disposes	3937.031719244743
From some such difficulty the newly named street died almost in birth and the purchaser of the kitchengarden having paid a high price for it and being quite unable to find anyone willing to take his bargain off his hands without a considerable loss yet still clinging to the belief that at some future day he should obtain a sum for it that would repay him not only for his past outlay but also the interest upon the capital locked up in his new acquisition contented himself with letting the ground temporarily to some marketgardeners at a yearly rental of 500 francs	268.8040557364583
And so as we have said the iron gate leading into the kitchengarden had been closed up and left to the rust which bade fair before long to eat off its hinges while to prevent the ignoble glances of the diggers and delvers of the ground from presuming to sully the aristocratic enclosure belonging to the mansion the gate had been boarded up to a height of six feet	152.96102856966723
True the planks were not so closely adjusted but that a hasty peep might be obtained through their interstices but the strict decorum and rigid propriety of the inhabitants of the house left no grounds for apprehending that advantage would be taken of that circumstance	281.33824619862736
Horticulture seemed however to have been abandoned in the deserted kitchengarden and where cabbages carrots radishes peas and melons had once flourished a scanty crop of lucern alone bore evidence of its being deemed worthy of cultivation	1096.8667850592803
A small low door gave egress from the walled space we have been describing into the projected street the ground having been abandoned as unproductive by its various renters and had now fallen so completely in general estimation as to return not even the onehalf per cent it had originally paid	354.6363666965242
Towards the house the chestnuttrees we have before mentioned rose high above the wall without in any way affecting the growth of other luxuriant shrubs and flowers that eagerly dressed forward to fill up the vacant spaces as though asserting their right to enjoy the boon of light and air	345.35370473501627
At one corner where the foliage became so thick as almost to shut out day a large stone bench and sundry rustic seats indicated that this sheltered spot was either in general favor or particular use by some inhabitant of the house which was faintly discernible through the dense mass of verdure that partially concealed it though situated but a hundred paces off	407.69113286100065
Whoever had selected this retired portion of the grounds as the boundary of a walk or as a place for meditation was abundantly justified in the choice by the absence of all glare the cool refreshing shade the screen it afforded from the scorching rays of the sun that found no entrance there even during the burning days of hottest summer the incessant and melodious warbling of birds and the entire removal from either the noise of the street or the bustle of the mansion	248.1931487161837
On the evening of one of the warmest days spring had yet bestowed on the inhabitants of Paris might be seen negligently thrown upon the stone bench a book a parasol and a workbasket from which hung a partly embroidered cambric handkerchief while at a little distance from these articles was a young woman standing close to the iron gate endeavoring to discern something on the other side by means of the openings in the planksthe earnestness of her attitude and the fixed gaze with which she seemed to seek the object of her wishes proving how much her feelings were interested in the matter	138.43866692277288
At that instant the little sidegate leading from the waste ground to the street was noiselessly opened and a tall powerful young man appeared	185.76057724870788
He was dressed in a common gray blouse and velvet cap but his carefully arranged hair beard and moustache all of the richest and glossiest black ill accorded with his plebeian attire	600.4580772791685
After casting a rapid glance around him in order to assure himself that he was unobserved he entered by the small gate and carefully closing and securing it after him proceeded with a hurried step towards the barrier	81.58830890048361
At the sight of him she expected though probably not in such a costume the young woman started in terror and was about to make a hasty retreat	130.20823181907144
But the eye of love had already seen even through the narrow chinks of the wooden palisades the movement of the white robe and observed the fluttering of the blue sash	211.77892754918028
Pressing his lips close to the planks he exclaimed	85.12168686580023
Do nt be alarmed Valentineit is I	16.94155723253337
Again the timid girl found courage to return to the gate saying as she did so	70.28407759318426
And why do you come so late today It is almost dinnertime and I had to use no little diplomacy to get rid of my watchful stepmother my toodevoted maid and my troublesome brother who is always teasing me about coming to work at my embroidery which I am in a fair way never to get done	217.96003428264476
So pray excuse yourself as well as you can for having made me wait and after that tell me why I see you in a dress so singular that at first I did not recognize you	51.784396623519385
Dearest Valentine said the young man the difference between our respective stations makes me fear to offend you by speaking of my love but yet I can not find myself in your presence without longing to pour forth my soul and tell you how fondly I adore you	129.894965602704
If it be but to carry away with me the recollection of such sweet moments I could even thank you for chiding me for it leaves me a gleam of hope that if you did not expect me and that indeed would be worse than vanity to suppose at least I was in your thoughts	85.75308871384476
You asked me the cause of my being late and why I come disguised	93.21244172432195
I will candidly explain the reason of both and I trust to your goodness to pardon me	81.87429665264264
A trade Oh Maximilian how can you jest at a time when we have such deep cause for uneasiness	103.96330565724236
Heaven keep me from jesting with that which is far dearer to me than life itself But listen to me Valentine and I will tell you all about it	72.80505121499608
I became weary of ranging fields and scaling walls and seriously alarmed at the idea suggested by you that if caught hovering about here your father would very likely have me sent to prison as a thief	348.09257370715756
That would compromise the honor of the French army to say nothing of the fact that the continual presence of a captain of Spahis in a place where no warlike projects could be supposed to account for it might well create surprise so I have become a gardener and consequently adopted the costume of my calling	144.93191686496252
What excessive nonsense you talk Maximilian	568.4921685079148
Nonsense Pray do not call what I consider the wisest action of my life by such a name	89.49208696676246
Consider by becoming a gardener I effectually screen our meetings from all suspicion or danger	1207.2333702521373
I beseech of you Maximilian to cease trifling and tell me what you really mean	146.97293404107796
Simply that having ascertained that the piece of ground on which I stand was to let I made application for it was readily accepted by the proprietor and am now master of this fine crop of lucern	256.11885572691983
Think of that Valentine There is nothing now to prevent my building myself a little hut on my plantation and residing not twenty yards from you	233.880916955947
Only imagine what happiness that would afford me	82.74658049236372
I can scarcely contain myself at the bare idea	108.88947709387845
Such felicity seems above all priceas a thing impossible and unattainable	2440.6977771480338
But would you believe that I purchase all this delight joy and happiness for which I would cheerfully have surrendered ten years of my life at the small cost of 500 francs per annum paid quarterly Henceforth we have nothing to fear	113.67843525283432
I am on my own ground and have an undoubted right to place a ladder against the wall and to look over when I please without having any apprehensions of being taken off by the police as a suspicious character	137.31721634517646
I may also enjoy the precious privilege of assuring you of my fond faithful and unalterable affection whenever you visit your favorite bower unless indeed it offends your pride to listen to professions of love from the lips of a poor workingman clad in a blouse and cap	396.6802859035597
A faint cry of mingled pleasure and surprise escaped from the lips of Valentine who almost instantly said in a saddened tone as though some envious cloud darkened the joy which illumined her heart	115.18280504095308
Alas no Maximilian this must not be for many reasons	64.23703221816746
We should presume too much on our own strength and like others perhaps be led astray by our blind confidence in each others prudence	256.97854106979696
How can you for an instant entertain so unworthy a thought dear Valentine Have I not from the first blessed hour of our acquaintance schooled all my words and actions to your sentiments and ideas And you have I am sure the fullest confidence in my honor	168.11365506951995
When you spoke to me of experiencing a vague and indefinite sense of coming danger I placed myself blindly and devotedly at your service asking no other reward than the pleasure of being useful to you and have I ever since by word or look given you cause of regret for having selected me from the numbers that would willingly have sacrificed their lives for you You told me my dear Valentine that you were engaged to M	187.7285876252821
dpinay and that your father was resolved upon completing the match and that from his will there was no appeal as M	224.4161889935777
de Villefort was never known to change a determination once formed	527.8835961635996
I kept in the background as you wished and waited not for the decision of your heart or my own but hoping that Providence would graciously interpose in our behalf and order events in our favor	203.83951922290228
But what cared I for delays or difficulties Valentine as long as you confessed that you loved me and took pity on me If you will only repeat that avowal now and then I can endure anything	187.73144608181838
Ah Maximilian that is the very thing that makes you so bold and which renders me at once so happy and unhappy that I frequently ask myself whether it is better for me to endure the harshness of my stepmother and her blind preference for her own child or to be as I now am insensible to any pleasure save such as I find in these meetings so fraught with danger to both	134.74339421600519
I will not admit that word returned the young man it is at once cruel and unjust	111.74044957026759
Is it possible to find a more submissive slave than myself You have permitted me to converse with you from time to time Valentine but forbidden my ever following you in your walks or elsewherehave I not obeyed And since I found means to enter this enclosure to exchange a few words with you through this gateto be close to you without really seeing youhave I ever asked so much as to touch the hem of your gown or tried to pass this barrier which is but a trifle to one of my youth and strength Never has a complaint or a murmur escaped me	190.93541595738196
I have been bound by my promises as rigidly as any knight of olden times	863.4106296659041
Come come dearest Valentine confess that what I say is true lest I be tempted to call you unjust	114.09544490426505
It is true said Valentine as she passed the end of her slender fingers through a small opening in the planks and permitted Maximilian to press his lips to them and you are a true and faithful friend but still you acted from motives of selfinterest my dear Maximilian for you well knew that from the moment in which you had manifested an opposite spirit all would have been ended between us	118.65215356545214
You promised to bestow on me the friendly affection of a brother	88.85177866654938
For I have no friend but yourself upon earth who am neglected and forgotten by my father harassed and persecuted by my stepmother and left to the sole companionship of a paralyzed and speechless old man whose withered hand can no longer press mine and who can speak to me with the eye alone although there still lingers in his heart the warmest tenderness for his poor grandchild	171.79515827533368
Oh how bitter a fate is mine to serve either as a victim or an enemy to all who are stronger than myself while my only friend and supporter is a living corpse Indeed indeed Maximilian I am very miserable and if you love me it must be out of pity	114.57455071686682
Valentine replied the young man deeply affected I will not say you are all I love in the world for I dearly prize my sister and brotherinlaw but my affection for them is calm and tranquil in no manner resembling what I feel for you	119.59512976687803
When I think of you my heart beats fast the blood burns in my veins and I can hardly breathe but I solemnly promise you to restrain all this ardor this fervor and intensity of feeling until you yourself shall require me to render them available in serving or assisting you	233.72532662741762
Franz is not expected to return home for a year to come I am told in that time many favorable and unforeseen chances may befriend us	255.83191887342352
Let us then hope for the best hope is so sweet a comforter	239.81869346862112
Meanwhile Valentine while reproaching me with selfishness think a little what you have been to methe beautiful but cold resemblance of a marble Venus	431.8116157059586
What promise of future reward have you made me for all the submission and obedience I have evincednone whatever	210.71787447957522
Franz dpinay your betrothed lover and you shrink from the idea of being his wife but tell me Valentine is there no other sorrow in your heart You see me devoted to you body and soul my life and each warm drop that circles round my heart are consecrated to your service you know full well that my existence is bound up in yoursthat were I to lose you I would not outlive the hour of such crushing misery yet you speak with calmness of the prospect of your being the wife of another Oh Valentine were I in your place and did I feel conscious as you do of being worshipped adored with such a love as mine a hundred times at least should I have passed my hand between these iron bars and said Take this hand dearest Maximilian and believe that living or dead I am yoursyours only and forever	165.45499406437747
The poor girl made no reply but her lover could plainly hear her sobs and tears	85.06276762120808
A rapid change took place in the young mans feelings	18.001487826475056
Dearest dearest Valentine exclaimed he forgive me if I have offended you and forget the words I spoke if they have unwittingly caused you pain	150.63427216704417
No Maximilian I am not offended answered she but do you not see what a poor helpless being I am almost a stranger and an outcast in my fathers house where even he is seldom seen whose will has been thwarted and spirits broken from the age of ten years beneath the iron rod so sternly held over me oppressed mortified and persecuted day by day hour by hour minute by minute no person has cared for even observed my sufferings nor have I ever breathed one word on the subject save to yourself	253.24909502810087
Outwardly and in the eyes of the world I am surrounded by kindness and affection but the reverse is the case	68.78652165223286
The general remark is Oh it can not be expected that one of so stern a character as M	89.12807717519829
Villefort could lavish the tenderness some fathers do on their daughters	996.7060581791395
What though she has lost her own mother at a tender age she has had the happiness to find a second mother in Madame de Villefort	73.44706111759177
The world however is mistaken my father abandons me from utter indifference while my stepmother detests me with a hatred so much the more terrible because it is veiled beneath a continual smile	186.4324599930223
Hate you sweet Valentine exclaimed the young man how is it possible for anyone to do that	23.143733322577496
Alas replied the weeping girl I am obliged to own that my stepmothers aversion to me arises from a very natural sourceher overweening love for her own child my brother Edward	223.02963983351472
I do not know but though unwilling to introduce money matters into our present conversation I will just say this muchthat her extreme dislike to me has its origin there and I much fear she envies me the fortune I enjoy in right of my mother and which will be more than doubled at the death of M	203.62746022738213
de SaintMran whose sole heiress I am	20.89264867157765
Madame de Villefort has nothing of her own and hates me for being so richly endowed	185.2311850840356
Alas how gladly would I exchange the half of this wealth for the happiness of at least sharing my fathers love	214.99569413038182
God knows I would prefer sacrificing the whole so that it would obtain me a happy and affectionate home	206.6095056440135
I seem to myself as though living a life of bondage yet at the same time am so conscious of my own weakness that I fear to break the restraint in which I am held lest I fall utterly helpless	185.37868910818835
Then too my father is not a person whose orders may be infringed with impunity protected as he is by his high position and firmly established reputation for talent and unswerving integrity no one could oppose him he is allpowerful even with the king he would crush you at a word	210.3899484231837
Dear Maximilian believe me when I assure you that if I do not attempt to resist my fathers commands it is more on your account than my own	33.568779139664784
But why Valentine do you persist in anticipating the worstwhy picture so gloomy a future	809.764287483013
Because I judge it from the past	34.05794967870359
Still consider that although I may not be strictly speaking what is termed an illustrious match for you I am for many reasons not altogether so much beneath your alliance	161.4258811067431
The days when such distinctions were so nicely weighed and considered no longer exist in France and the first families of the monarchy have intermarried with those of the empire	159.46998480471242
The aristocracy of the lance has allied itself with the nobility of the cannon	88.71137185480579
Now I belong to this lastnamed class and certainly my prospects of military preferment are most encouraging as well as certain	846.6603274412096
My fortune though small is free and unfettered and the memory of my late father is respected in our country Valentine as that of the most upright and honorable merchant of the city I say our country because you were born not far from Marseilles	152.28899892739545
Do nt speak of Marseilles I beg of you Maximilian that one word brings back my mother to my recollectionmy angel mother who died too soon for myself and all who knew her but who after watching over her child during the brief period allotted to her in this world now I fondly hope watches from her home in heaven	167.9879799048628
Oh if my mother were still living there would be nothing to fear Maximilian for I would tell her that I loved you and she would protect us	68.78563356731728
I fear Valentine replied the lover that were she living I should never have had the happiness of knowing you you would then have been too happy to have stooped from your grandeur to bestow a thought on me	115.09460998093138
Now it is you who are unjust Maximilian cried Valentine but there is one thing I wish to know	68.47865364079237
And what is that inquired the young man perceiving that Valentine hesitated	59.077166503643795
Tell me truly Maximilian whether in former days when our fathers dwelt at Marseilles there was ever any misunderstanding between them	383.8579148531655
Not that I am aware of replied the young man unless indeed any illfeeling might have arisen from their being of opposite partiesyour father was as you know a zealous partisan of the Bourbons while mine was wholly devoted to the emperor there could not possibly be any other difference between them	207.68863751682795
I will tell you replied the young girl for it is but right you should know	54.57932003585883
Well on the day when your appointment as an officer of the Legion of Honor was announced in the papers we were all sitting with my grandfather M	79.62253990729306
Danglars was there alsoyou recollect M	114.33861496007943
Danglars do you not Maximilian the banker whose horses ran away with my stepmother and little brother and very nearly killed them While the rest of the company were discussing the approaching marriage of Mademoiselle Danglars I was reading the paper to my grandfather but when I came to the paragraph about you although I had done nothing else but read it over to myself all the morning you know you had told me all about it the previous evening I felt so happy and yet so nervous at the idea of speaking your name aloud and before so many people that I really think I should have passed it over but for the fear that my doing so might create suspicions as to the cause of my silence so I summoned up all my courage and read it as firmly and as steadily as I could	98.43617145125613
Well would you believe it directly my father caught the sound of your name he turned round quite hastily and like a poor silly thing I was so persuaded that everyone must be as much affected as myself by the utterance of your name that I was not surprised to see my father start and almost tremble but I even thought though that surely must have been a mistake that M	102.84413505602437
Morrel Morrel cried my father stop a bit then knitting his brows into a deep frown he added surely this can not be one of the Morrel family who lived at Marseilles and gave us so much trouble from their violent BonapartismI mean about the year 1815	221.50420924053793
Danglars I believe he is the son of the old shipowner	39.325511280818375
Indeed answered Maximilian and what did your father say then Valentine	112.1828094681272
Oh such a dreadful thing that I do nt dare to tell you	29.845250791227627
Always tell me everything said Maximilian with a smile	9.919359084715
Ah continued my father still frowning their idolized emperor treated these madmen as they deserved he called them food for cannon which was precisely all they were good for and I am delighted to see that the present government have adopted this salutary principle with all its pristine vigor if Algiers were good for nothing but to furnish the means of carrying so admirable an idea into practice it would be an acquisition well worthy of struggling to obtain	375.74372643833124
Though it certainly does cost France somewhat dear to assert her rights in that uncivilized country	765.0703650268993
said Maximilian but do nt attach any serious importance dear to what your father said	97.85931897930769
My father was not a bit behind yours in that sort of talk	406.5888321001926
Why said he does not the emperor who has devised so many clever and efficient modes of improving the art of war organize a regiment of lawyers judges and legal practitioners sending them in the hottest fire the enemy could maintain and using them to save better men You see my dear that for picturesque expression and generosity of spirit there is not much to choose between the language of either party	380.79232461102407
Danglars say to this outburst on the part of the procureur	14.755649228147831
Oh he laughed and in that singular manner so peculiar to himselfhalfmalicious halfferocious he almost immediately got up and took his leave then for the first time I observed the agitation of my grandfather and I must tell you Maximilian that I am the only person capable of discerning emotion in his paralyzed frame	117.62747493179529
And I suspected that the conversation that had been carried on in his presence for they always say and do what they like before the dear old man without the smallest regard for his feelings had made a strong impression on his mind for naturally enough it must have pained him to hear the emperor he so devotedly loved and served spoken of in that depreciating manner	158.84462347222467
Noirtier interposed Maximilian is celebrated throughout Europe he was a statesman of high standing and you may or may not know Valentine that he took a leading part in every Bonapartist conspiracy set on foot during the restoration of the Bourbons	261.09595599381686
Oh I have often heard whispers of things that seem to me most strangethe father a Bonapartist the son a Royalist what can have been the reason of so singular a difference in parties and politics But to resume my story I turned towards my grandfather as though to question him as to the cause of his emotion he looked expressively at the newspaper I had been reading	172.78632729110086
What is the matter dear grandfather said I are you pleased He gave me a sign in the affirmative	98.1331197453333
With what my father said just now He returned a sign in the negative	158.90997040496364
Danglars said Another sign in the negative	146.31846075554805
Oh then you were glad to hear that M	35.02615014716734
Morrel I did nt dare to say Maximilian had been made an officer of the Legion of Honor He signified assent only think of the poor old mans being so pleased to think that you who were a perfect stranger to him had been made an officer of the Legion of Honor Perhaps it was a mere whim on his part for he is falling they say into second childhood but I love him for showing so much interest in you	92.21984947347057
How singular murmured Maximilian your father hates me while your grandfather on the contraryWhat strange feelings are aroused by politics	275.0326916993752
Hush cried Valentine suddenly someone is coming Maximilian leaped at one bound into his crop of lucern which he began to pull up in the most ruthless way under the pretext of being occupied in weeding it	130.5534671481984
Mademoiselle mademoiselle exclaimed a voice from behind the trees	58.1241812375513
Madame is searching for you everywhere there is a visitor in the drawingroom	56.737899166482286
A visitor inquired Valentine much agitated who is it	137.00516328621242
Some grand personagea prince I believe they saidthe Count of Monte Cristo	69.25289077066822
I will come directly cried Valentine aloud	75.62796846877396
The name of Monte Cristo sent an electric shock through the young man on the other side of the iron gate to whom Valentines I am coming was the customary signal of farewell	82.73056031184632
Now then said Maximilian leaning on the handle of his spade I would give a good deal to know how it comes about that the Count of Monte Cristo is acquainted with M	36.353752751466125
It was really the Count of Monte Cristo who had just arrived at Madame de Villeforts for the purpose of returning the procureurs visit and at his name as may be easily imagined the whole house was in confusion	45.84934600589517
Madame de Villefort who was alone in her drawingroom when the count was announced desired that her son might be brought thither instantly to renew his thanks to the count and Edward who heard this great personage talked of for two whole days made all possible haste to come to him not from obedience to his mother or out of any feeling of gratitude to the count but from sheer curiosity and that some chance remark might give him the opportunity for making one of the impertinent speeches which made his mother say	143.97582067862763
Oh that naughty child But I ca nt be severe with him he is really so bright	79.56195052570192
After the usual civilities the count inquired after M	279.80408133028965
My husband dines with the chancellor replied the young lady he has just gone and I am sure hell be exceedingly sorry not to have had the pleasure of seeing you before he went	95.63417763166159
Two visitors who were there when the count arrived having gazed at him with all their eyes retired after that reasonable delay which politeness admits and curiosity requires	319.2806455155499
What is your sister Valentine doing inquired Madame de Villefort of Edward tell someone to bid her come here that I may have the honor of introducing her to the count	91.05104819670356
You have a daughter then madame inquired the count very young I presume	159.29849995845905
de Villefort by his first marriage replied the young wife a fine wellgrown girl	336.72964212124435
But melancholy interrupted Master Edward snatching the feathers out of the tail of a splendid paroquet that was screaming on its gilded perch in order to make a plume for his hat	195.87127260410904
Madame de Villefort merely cried Be still Edward She then added This young madcap is however very nearly right and merely reechoes what he has heard me say with pain a hundred times for Mademoiselle de Villefort is in spite of all we can do to rouse her of a melancholy disposition and taciturn habit which frequently injure the effect of her beauty	224.02520785677643
But what detains her Go Edward and see	27.42485193425202
Because they are looking for her where she is not to be found	63.68641754124855
And where are they looking for her	44.82299378937449
And do you think she is not there	38.130685219810424
No no no no no she is not there replied Edward singing his words	248.68374748204025
And where is she then If you know why do nt you tell	39.66762504286538
She is under the big chestnuttree replied the spoiled brat as he gave in spite of his mothers commands live flies to the parrot which seemed keenly to relish such fare	577.6603571364387
Madame de Villefort stretched out her hand to ring intending to direct her waitingmaid to the spot where she would find Valentine when the young lady herself entered the apartment	72.42825413113712
She appeared much dejected and any person who considered her attentively might have observed the traces of recent tears in her eyes	142.0669138237313
Valentine whom we have in the rapid march of our narrative presented to our readers without formally introducing her was a tall and graceful girl of nineteen with bright chestnut hair deep blue eyes and that reposeful air of quiet distinction which characterized her mother	310.8641590172052
Her white and slender fingers her pearly neck her cheeks tinted with varying hues reminded one of the lovely Englishwomen who have been so poetically compared in their manner to the gracefulness of a swan	167.35637308455262
She entered the apartment and seeing near her stepmother the stranger of whom she had already heard so much saluted him without any girlish awkwardness or even lowering her eyes and with an elegance that redoubled the counts attention	180.4302006179974
He rose to return the salutation	10049.226736980701
Mademoiselle de Villefort my stepdaughter said Madame de Villefort to Monte Cristo leaning back on her sofa and motioning towards Valentine with her hand	36.92495347064527
de Monte Cristo King of China Emperor of CochinChina said the young imp looking slyly towards his sister	497.1026241426956
Madame de Villefort at this really did turn pale and was very nearly angry with this household plague who answered to the name of Edward but the count on the contrary smiled and appeared to look at the boy complacently which caused the maternal heart to bound again with joy and enthusiasm	176.12515106568648
But madame replied the count continuing the conversation and looking by turns at Madame de Villefort and Valentine have I not already had the honor of meeting yourself and mademoiselle before I could not help thinking so just now the idea came over my mind and as mademoiselle entered the sight of her was an additional ray of light thrown on a confused remembrance excuse the remark	138.69713879428681
I do not think it likely sir Mademoiselle de Villefort is not very fond of society and we very seldom go out said the young lady	98.4386148267487
Then it was not in society that I met with mademoiselle or yourself madame or this charming little merry boy	342.056314458246
Besides the Parisian world is entirely unknown to me for as I believe I told you I have been in Paris but very few days	34.75602675630476
Nobut perhaps you will permit me to call to mindstay	72.48712700344922
The Count placed his hand on his brow as if to collect his thoughts	17.0275317550968
Noit was somewhereaway from hereit wasI do not knowbut it appears that this recollection is connected with a lovely sky and some religious fte mademoiselle was holding flowers in her hand the interesting boy was chasing a beautiful peacock in a garden and you madame were under the trellis of some arbor	307.40857372862143
Pray come to my aid madame do not these circumstances appeal to your memory	118.83006065631562
No indeed replied Madame de Villefort and yet it appears to me sir that if I had met you anywhere the recollection of you must have been imprinted on my memory	57.790982367863904
Perhaps the count saw us in Italy said Valentine timidly	149.50234929964702
Yes in Italy it was in Italy most probably replied Monte Cristo you have travelled then in Italy mademoiselle	226.81775192246707
Yes madame and I were there two years ago	63.27578361020191
The doctors anxious for my lungs had prescribed the air of Naples	402.08653111344745
We went by Bologna Perugia and Rome	358.8150504660648
Ah yestrue mademoiselle exclaimed Monte Cristo as if this simple explanation was sufficient to revive the recollection he sought	61.48604815537388
It was at Perugia on Corpus Christi Day in the garden of the Htel des Postes when chance brought us together you Madame de Villefort and her son I now remember having had the honor of meeting you	76.58246731484984
I perfectly well remember Perugia sir and the Htel des Postes and the festival of which you speak said Madame de Villefort but in vain do I tax my memory of whose treachery I am ashamed for I really do not recall to mind that I ever had the pleasure of seeing you before	53.242293268613096
It is strange but neither do I recollect meeting with you observed Valentine raising her beautiful eyes to the count	80.27359384523295
But I remember it perfectly interposed the darling Edward	3070.9866147498205
I will assist your memory madame continued the count the day had been burning hot you were waiting for horses which were delayed in consequence of the festival	181.55866684507546
Mademoiselle was walking in the shade of the garden and your son disappeared in pursuit of the peacock	83.27932487338755
And I caught it mamma do nt you remember interposed Edward and I pulled three such beautiful feathers out of his tail	301.2999592619268
You madame remained under the arbor do you not remember that while you were seated on a stone bench and while as I told you Mademoiselle de Villefort and your young son were absent you conversed for a considerable time with somebody	118.8516858885636
Yes in truth yes answered the young lady turning very red I do remember conversing with a person wrapped in a long woollen mantle he was a medical man I think	133.504995969592
Precisely so madame this man was myself for a fortnight I had been at that hotel during which period I had cured my valet de chambre of a fever and my landlord of the jaundice so that I really acquired a reputation as a skilful physician	139.01860113704282
We discoursed a long time madame on different subjects of Perugino of Raphael of manners customs of the famous aqua Tofana of which they had told you I think you said that certain individuals in Perugia had preserved the secret	314.66484109332015
Yes true replied Madame de Villefort somewhat uneasily I remember now	433.7746629920324
I do not recollect now all the various subjects of which we discoursed madame continued the count with perfect calmness but I perfectly remember that falling into the error which others had entertained respecting me you consulted me as to the health of Mademoiselle de Villefort	122.7868265082037
Yes really sir you were in fact a medical man said Madame de Villefort since you had cured the sick	95.86231087863811
Molire or Beaumarchais would reply to you madame that it was precisely because I was not that I had cured my patients for myself I am content to say to you that I have studied chemistry and the natural sciences somewhat deeply but still only as an amateur you understand	109.26470718893087
At this moment the clock struck six	77.91644338988372
It is six oclock said Madame de Villefort evidently agitated	56.165935428972865
Valentine will you not go and see if your grandpapa will have his dinner	54.81881418401584
Valentine rose and saluting the count left the apartment without speaking	66.42597138825964
Oh madame said the count when Valentine had left the room was it on my account that you sent Mademoiselle de Villefort away	50.57819033756927
By no means replied the young lady quickly but this is the hour when we usually give M	77.91811281254945
Noirtier the unwelcome meal that sustains his pitiful existence	2717.021524530015
You are aware sir of the deplorable condition of my husbands father	197.59641258423378
de Villefort spoke of it to mea paralysis I think	428.2400466892787
Alas yes the poor old gentleman is entirely helpless the mind alone is still active in this human machine and that is faint and flickering like the light of a lamp about to expire	215.23874357027503
But excuse me sir for talking of our domestic misfortunes I interrupted you at the moment when you were telling me that you were a skilful chemist	119.40595770157051
No madame I did not say as much as that replied the count with a smile quite the contrary	52.02184863482973
I have studied chemistry because having determined to live in eastern climates I have been desirous of following the example of King Mithridates	255.76619942652727
Mithridates rex Ponticus said the young scamp as he tore some beautiful portraits out of a splendid album the individual who took cream in his cup of poison every morning at breakfast	309.90374308549826
Edward you naughty boy exclaimed Madame de Villefort snatching the mutilated book from the urchins grasp you are positively past bearing you really disturb the conversation go leave us and join your sister Valentine in dear grandpapa Noirtiers room	298.0500502848433
How dare you tear out the drawings	466.45687049654066
I wo nt go unless you give me the album said the boy seating himself doggedly in an armchair according to his habit of never giving way	136.9176308938443
Take it then and pray disturb us no longer said Madame de Villefort giving the album to Edward who then went towards the door led by his mother	55.71296638115224
The count followed her with his eyes	6.104081442395421
Let us see if she shuts the door after him he muttered	127.18546791244029
Madame de Villefort closed the door carefully after the child the count appearing not to notice her then casting a scrutinizing glance around the chamber the young wife returned to her chair in which she seated herself	90.90512008828657
Allow me to observe madame said the count with that kind tone he could assume so well you are really very severe with that dear clever child	93.46704491839861
Oh sometimes severity is quite necessary replied Madame de Villefort with all a mothers real firmness	113.44603301791365
It was his Cornelius Nepos that Master Edward was repeating when he referred to King Mithridates continued the count and you interrupted him in a quotation which proves that his tutor has by no means neglected him for your son is really advanced for his years	209.48182553743436
The fact is count answered the mother agreeably flattered he has great aptitude and learns all that is set before him	513.5140303502782
He has but one fault he is somewhat wilful but really on referring for the moment to what he said do you truly believe that Mithridates used these precautions and that these precautions were efficacious	259.9907778148641
I think so madame because I myself have made use of them that I might not be poisoned at Naples at Palermo and at Smyrnathat is to say on three several occasions when but for these precautions I must have lost my life	101.77660075551233
Yes I remember now your mentioning to me at Perugia something of this sort	200.7398692741074
Indeed said the count with an air of surprise remarkably well counterfeited I really did not remember	243.1722604146709
I inquired of you if poisons acted equally and with the same effect on men of the North as on men of the South and you answered me that the cold and sluggish habits of the North did not present the same aptitude as the rich and energetic temperaments of the natives of the South	200.186189179859
And that is the case observed Monte Cristo	73.88769486068355
I have seen Russians devour without being visibly inconvenienced vegetable substances which would infallibly have killed a Neapolitan or an Arab	793.1323847499717
And you really believe the result would be still more sure with us than in the East and in the midst of our fogs and rains a man would habituate himself more easily than in a warm latitude to this progressive absorption of poison	194.06860144439938
Certainly it being at the same time perfectly understood that he should have been duly fortified against the poison to which he had not been accustomed	54.971088223696704
Yes I understand that and how would you habituate yourself for instance or rather how did you habituate yourself to it	88.44651888335551
Suppose you knew beforehand the poison that would be made use of against you suppose the poison was for instance brucine	136.69399384924077
Brucine is extracted from the false angostura8 is it not inquired Madame de Villefort	135.7014101886237
Precisely madame replied Monte Cristo but I perceive I have not much to teach you	49.07041847427823
Allow me to compliment you on your knowledge such learning is very rare among ladies	419.1351179184431
Oh I am aware of that said Madame de Villefort but I have a passion for the occult sciences which speak to the imagination like poetry and are reducible to figures like an algebraic equation but go on I beg of you what you say interests me to the greatest degree	156.91889011916018
Well replied Monte Cristo suppose then that this poison was brucine and you were to take a milligramme the first day two milligrammes the second day and so on	130.84617341423473
Well at the end of ten days you would have taken a centigramme at the end of twenty days increasing another milligramme you would have taken three hundred centigrammes that is to say a dose which you would support without inconvenience and which would be very dangerous for any other person who had not taken the same precautions as yourself	88.16921238620195
Well then at the end of a month when drinking water from the same carafe you would kill the person who drank with you without your perceiving otherwise than from slight inconvenience that there was any poisonous substance mingled with this water	223.83438754538926
Do you know any other counterpoisons	215618.3571319203
I have often read and read again the history of Mithridates said Madame de Villefort in a tone of reflection and had always considered it a fable	78.82047616147699
No madame contrary to most history it is true but what you tell me madame what you inquire of me is not the result of a chance query for two years ago you asked me the same questions and said then that for a very long time this history of Mithridates had occupied your mind	93.86037295896854
The two favorite studies of my youth were botany and mineralogy and subsequently when I learned that the use of simples frequently explained the whole history of a people and the entire life of individuals in the East as flowers betoken and symbolize a love affair I have regretted that I was not a man that I might have been a Flamel a Fontana or a Cabanis	209.0495397432609
And the more madame said Monte Cristo as the Orientals do not confine themselves as did Mithridates to make a cuirass of his poisons but they also made them a dagger	142.02477119256142
Science becomes in their hands not only a defensive weapon but still more frequently an offensive one the one serves against all their physical sufferings the other against all their enemies	386.1801897377523
With opium belladonna brucea snakewood and the cherrylaurel they put to sleep all who stand in their way	124.5343426204902
There is not one of those women Egyptian Turkish or Greek whom here you call good women who do not know how by means of chemistry to stupefy a doctor and in psychology to amaze a confessor	355.943590160284
Really said Madame de Villefort whose eyes sparkled with strange fire at this conversation	97.89863289967677
Oh yes indeed madame continued Monte Cristo the secret dramas of the East begin with a love philtre and end with a death potionbegin with paradise and end withhell	394.77224207617627
There are as many elixirs of every kind as there are caprices and peculiarities in the physical and moral nature of humanity and I will say furtherthe art of these chemists is capable with the utmost precision to accommodate and proportion the remedy and the bane to yearnings for love or desires for vengeance	337.274272299578
But sir remarked the young woman these Eastern societies in the midst of which you have passed a portion of your existence are as fantastic as the tales that come from their strange land	194.9051581990802
A man can easily be put out of the way there then it is indeed the Bagdad and Bassora of the Thousand and One Nights	123.36665015821931
The sultans and viziers who rule over society there and who constitute what in France we call the government are really HarounalRaschids and Giaffars who not only pardon a poisoner but even make him a prime minister if his crime has been an ingenious one and who under such circumstances have the whole story written in letters of gold to divert their hours of idleness and ennui	282.1275436049014
By no means madame the fanciful exists no longer in the East	395.56304669919007
There disguised under other names and concealed under other costumes are police agents magistrates attorneysgeneral and bailiffs	2653.691970638448
They hang behead and impale their criminals in the most agreeable possible manner but some of these like clever rogues have contrived to escape human justice and succeed in their fraudulent enterprises by cunning stratagems	345.68249970490405
Amongst us a simpleton possessed by the demon of hate or cupidity who has an enemy to destroy or some near relation to dispose of goes straight to the grocers or druggists gives a false name which leads more easily to his detection than his real one and under the pretext that the rats prevent him from sleeping purchases five or six grammes of arsenicif he is really a cunning fellow he goes to five or six different druggists or grocers and thereby becomes only five or six times more easily tracedthen when he has acquired his specific he administers duly to his enemy or near kinsman a dose of arsenic which would make a mammoth or mastodon burst and which without rhyme or reason makes his victim utter groans which alarm the entire neighborhood	375.50506480044504
Then arrive a crowd of policemen and constables	2675.088171340836
They fetch a doctor who opens the dead body and collects from the entrails and stomach a quantity of arsenic in a spoon	259.2047112278926
Next day a hundred newspapers relate the fact with the names of the victim and the murderer	68.53738305726863
The same evening the grocer or grocers druggist or druggists come and say It was I who sold the arsenic to the gentleman and rather than not recognize the guilty purchaser they will recognize twenty	311.98566657940376
Then the foolish criminal is taken imprisoned interrogated confronted confounded condemned and cut off by hemp or steel or if she be a woman of any consideration they lock her up for life	733.5824440281084
This is the way in which you Northerns understand chemistry madame	1095.8245500833123
Desrues was however I must confess more skilful	1660.7827522450546
What would you have sir said the lady laughing we do what we can	47.66593585730242
All the world has not the secret of the Medicis or the Borgias	159.858336393677
Now replied the count shrugging his shoulders shall I tell you the cause of all these stupidities It is because at your theatres by what at least I could judge by reading the pieces they play they see persons swallow the contents of a phial or suck the button of a ring and fall dead instantly	141.8107976363515
Five minutes afterwards the curtain falls and the spectators depart	639.3180793183055
They are ignorant of the consequences of the murder they see neither the police commissary with his badge of office nor the corporal with his four men and so the poor fools believe that the whole thing is as easy as lying	161.39142305807823
But go a little way from Francego either to Aleppo or Cairo or only to Naples or Rome and you will see people passing by you in the streetspeople erect smiling and freshcolored of whom Asmodeus if you were holding on by the skirt of his mantle would say That man was poisoned three weeks ago he will be a dead man in a month	235.54284614020818
Then remarked Madame de Villefort they have again discovered the secret of the famous aqua Tofana that they said was lost at Perugia	243.5642494579978
Ah but madame does mankind ever lose anything The arts change about and make a tour of the world things take a different name and the vulgar do not follow themthat is all but there is always the same result	180.1064735444326
Poisons act particularly on some organ or anotherone on the stomach another on the brain another on the intestines	395.3167716170365
Well the poison brings on a cough the cough an inflammation of the lungs or some other complaint catalogued in the book of science which however by no means precludes it from being decidedly mortal and if it were not would be sure to become so thanks to the remedies applied by foolish doctors who are generally bad chemists and which will act in favor of or against the malady as you please and then there is a human being killed according to all the rules of art and skill and of whom justice learns nothing as was said by a terrible chemist of my acquaintance the worthy Abb Adelmonte of Taormina in Sicily who has studied these national phenomena very profoundly	237.8046295536034
It is quite frightful but deeply interesting said the young lady motionless with attention	201.99483925316977
I thought I must confess that these tales were inventions of the Middle Ages	395.52142318573453
Yes no doubt but improved upon by ours	1022.1187743946999
What is the use of time rewards of merit medals crosses Monthyon prizes if they do not lead society towards more complete perfection Yet man will never be perfect until he learns to create and destroy he does know how to destroy and that is half the battle	745.890954255135
So added Madame de Villefort constantly returning to her object the poisons of the Borgias the Medicis the Renes the Ruggieris and later probably that of Baron de Trenck whose story has been so misused by modern drama and romance	519.2851840839961
Were objects of art madame and nothing more replied the count	51.17204361888036
Do you suppose that the real savant addresses himself stupidly to the mere individual By no means	1274.6581093738812
Science loves eccentricities leaps and bounds trials of strength fancies if I may be allowed so to term them	439.19165366479564
Thus for instance the excellent Abb Adelmonte of whom I spoke just now made in this way some marvellous experiments	122.04732751311074
Yes I will mention one to you	19.280931032851157
He had a remarkably fine garden full of vegetables flowers and fruit	330.87853114210543
From amongst these vegetables he selected the most simplea cabbage for instance	857.9668044193961
For three days he watered this cabbage with a distillation of arsenic on the third the cabbage began to droop and turn yellow	339.6492271484874
At that moment he cut it	58.39569349191444
In the eyes of everybody it seemed fit for table and preserved its wholesome appearance	367.1483531398396
It was only poisoned to the Abb Adelmonte	206.91589885361273
He then took the cabbage to the room where he had rabbitsfor the Abb Adelmonte had a collection of rabbits cats and guineapigs fully as fine as his collection of vegetables flowers and fruit	277.77656860297236
Well the Abb Adelmonte took a rabbit and made it eat a leaf of the cabbage	208.32802603381742
What magistrate would find or even venture to insinuate anything against this What procureur has ever ventured to draw up an accusation against M	212.58725447113625
Flourens in consequence of the rabbits cats and guineapigs they have killednot one	1422.6690893437294
So then the rabbit dies and justice takes no notice	198.00344802467822
This rabbit dead the Abb Adelmonte has its entrails taken out by his cook and thrown on the dunghill on this dunghill is a hen who pecking these intestines is in her turn taken ill and dies next day	297.0370189627324
At the moment when she is struggling in the convulsions of death a vulture is flying by there are a good many vultures in Adelmontes country this bird darts on the dead fowl and carries it away to a rock where it dines off its prey	391.1585800530621
Three days afterwards this poor vulture which has been very much indisposed since that dinner suddenly feels very giddy while flying aloft in the clouds and falls heavily into a fishpond	467.9471662395736
The pike eels and carp eat greedily always as everybody knowswell they feast on the vulture	1360.4864036398635
Now suppose that next day one of these eels or pike or carp poisoned at the fourth remove is served up at your table	402.1263696377445
Well then your guest will be poisoned at the fifth remove and die at the end of eight or ten days of pains in the intestines sickness or abscess of the pylorus	171.1748952576754
The doctors open the body and say with an air of profound learning The subject has died of a tumor on the liver or of typhoid fever	173.96127424035896
But remarked Madame de Villefort all these circumstances which you link thus to one another may be broken by the least accident the vulture may not see the fowl or may fall a hundred yards from the fishpond	149.51787355962264
Ah that is where the art comes in	590.5952072879936
To be a great chemist in the East one must direct chance and this is to be achieved	169.37776434357698
Madame de Villefort was in deep thought yet listened attentively	235.40208039789846
But she exclaimed suddenly arsenic is indelible indestructible in whatsoever way it is absorbed it will be found again in the body of the victim from the moment when it has been taken in sufficient quantity to cause death	133.22099702230082
Precisely so cried Monte Cristoprecisely so and this is what I said to my worthy Adelmonte	137.2804804760473
He reflected smiled and replied to me by a Sicilian proverb which I believe is also a French proverb My son the world was not made in a daybut in seven	189.764537237949
On the Sunday following I did return to him	78.1336358033218
Instead of having watered his cabbage with arsenic he had watered it this time with a solution of salts having their basis in strychnine strychnos colubrina as the learned term it	868.4701021455335
Now the cabbage had not the slightest appearance of disease in the world and the rabbit had not the smallest distrust yet five minutes afterwards the rabbit was dead	167.37289003287455
The fowl pecked at the rabbit and the next day was a dead hen	225.10377038221293
This time we were the vultures so we opened the bird and this time all special symptoms had disappeared there were only general symptoms	564.677762550206
There was no peculiar indication in any organan excitement of the nervous systemthat was it a case of cerebral congestionnothing more	513.948653937567
The fowl had not been poisonedshe had died of apoplexy	852.8843781601448
Apoplexy is a rare disease among fowls I believe but very common among men	425.77633624086303
Madame de Villefort appeared more and more thoughtful	98.67629226737552
It is very fortunate she observed that such substances could only be prepared by chemists otherwise all the world would be poisoning each other	179.43070600432605
By chemists and persons who have a taste for chemistry said Monte Cristo carelessly	77.1038129886565
And then said Madame de Villefort endeavoring by a struggle and with effort to get away from her thoughts however skilfully it is prepared crime is always crime and if it avoid human scrutiny it does not escape the eye of God	156.18569573426234
The Orientals are stronger than we are in cases of conscience and very prudently have no hellthat is the point	224.73325976996802
Really madame this is a scruple which naturally must occur to a pure mind like yours but which would easily yield before sound reasoning	456.0320386462705
The bad side of human thought will always be defined by the paradox of Jean Jacques Rousseauyou rememberthe mandarin who is killed five hundred leagues off by raising the tip of the finger	275.1488798235407
Mans whole life passes in doing these things and his intellect is exhausted by reflecting on them	262.25489270586684
You will find very few persons who will go and brutally thrust a knife in the heart of a fellowcreature or will administer to him in order to remove him from the surface of the globe on which we move with life and animation that quantity of arsenic of which we just now talked	123.78554390210394
Such a thing is really out of ruleeccentric or stupid	577.1362010689081
To attain such a point the blood must be heated to thirtysix degrees the pulse be at least at ninety and the feelings excited beyond the ordinary limit	645.9114952768734
But suppose one pass as is permissible in philology from the word itself to its softened synonym then instead of committing an ignoble assassination you make an elimination you merely and simply remove from your path the individual who is in your way and that without shock or violence without the display of the sufferings which in the case of becoming a punishment make a martyr of the victim and a butcher in every sense of the word of him who inflicts them	259.81891485434704
Then there will be no blood no groans no convulsions and above all no consciousness of that horrid and compromising moment of accomplishing the actthen one escapes the clutch of the human law which says Do not disturb society This is the mode in which they manage these things and succeed in Eastern climes where there are grave and phlegmatic persons who care very little for the questions of time in conjunctures of importance	327.07768994523735
Yet conscience remains remarked Madame de Villefort in an agitated voice and with a stifled sigh	27.155915760075487
Yes answered Monte Cristo happily yes conscience does remain and if it did not how wretched we should be After every action requiring exertion it is conscience that saves us for it supplies us with a thousand good excuses of which we alone are judges and these reasons howsoever excellent in producing sleep would avail us but very little before a tribunal when we were tried for our lives	380.72448324518444
for instance was marvellously served by his conscience after the putting away of the two children of Edward IV	113.54302339081437
in fact he could say These two children of a cruel and persecuting king who have inherited the vices of their father which I alone could perceive in their juvenile propensitiesthese two children are impediments in my way of promoting the happiness of the English people whose unhappiness they the children would infallibly have caused	294.0407167279169
Thus was Lady Macbeth served by her conscience when she sought to give her son and not her husband whatever Shakespeare may say a throne	115.57215231167163
Ah maternal love is a great virtue a powerful motiveso powerful that it excuses a multitude of things even if after Duncans death Lady Macbeth had been at all pricked by her conscience	628.6756087034881
Madame de Villefort listened with avidity to these appalling maxims and horrible paradoxes delivered by the count with that ironical simplicity which was peculiar to him	325.5651904961327
After a moments silence the lady inquired	5915.232278696194
Do you know my dear count she said that you are a very terrible reasoner and that you look at the world through a somewhat distempered medium Have you really measured the world by scrutinies or through alembics and crucibles For you must indeed be a great chemist and the elixir you administered to my son which recalled him to life almost instantaneously	219.5022791209836
Oh do not place any reliance on that madame one drop of that elixir sufficed to recall life to a dying child but three drops would have impelled the blood into his lungs in such a way as to have produced most violent palpitations six would have suspended his respiration and caused syncope more serious than that in which he was ten would have destroyed him	230.2335032810041
You know madame how suddenly I snatched him from those phials which he so imprudently touched	372.594706476253
Is it then so terrible a poison	131.09282144936418
Oh no In the first place let us agree that the word poison does not exist because in medicine use is made of the most violent poisons which become according as they are employed most salutary remedies	258.7778380857359
A skilful preparation of my friends the worthy Abb Adelmonte who taught me the use of it	90.85445142665363
Oh observed Madame de Villefort it must be an admirable antispasmodic	304.8705458551656
Perfect madame as you have seen replied the count and I frequently make use of itwith all possible prudence though be it observed he added with a smile of intelligence	129.2947785341888
Most assuredly responded Madame de Villefort in the same tone	6.5869871068194135
As for me so nervous and so subject to fainting fits I should require a Doctor Adelmonte to invent for me some means of breathing freely and tranquillizing my mind in the fear I have of dying some fine day of suffocation	413.40375953844216
In the meanwhile as the thing is difficult to find in France and your abb is not probably disposed to make a journey to Paris on my account I must continue to use Monsieur Planches antispasmodics and mint and Hoffmans drops are among my favorite remedies	214.66950026840024
Here are some lozenges which I have made up on purpose they are compounded doubly strong	239.37978732485232
Monte Cristo opened the tortoiseshell box which the lady presented to him and inhaled the odor of the lozenges with the air of an amateur who thoroughly appreciated their composition	123.42804796467775
They are indeed exquisite he said but as they are necessarily submitted to the process of deglutitiona function which it is frequently impossible for a fainting person to accomplishI prefer my own specific	392.16303369891784
Undoubtedly and so should I prefer it after the effects I have seen produced but of course it is a secret and I am not so indiscreet as to ask it of you	66.4501075896636
But I said Monte Cristo rising as he spokeI am gallant enough to offer it you	228.82824361321428
Only remember one thinga small dose is a remedy a large one is poison	384.8161151634304
One drop will restore life as you have seen five or six will inevitably kill and in a way the more terrible inasmuch as poured into a glass of wine it would not in the slightest degree affect its flavor	129.43820756269946
But I say no more madame it is really as if I were prescribing for you	86.34424467207123
The clock struck halfpast six and a lady was announced a friend of Madame de Villefort who came to dine with her	32.87751126285516
If I had had the honor of seeing you for the third or fourth time count instead of only for the second said Madame de Villefort if I had had the honor of being your friend instead of only having the happiness of being under an obligation to you I should insist on detaining you to dinner and not allow myself to be daunted by a first refusal	63.33060254889185
A thousand thanks madame replied Monte Cristo but I have an engagement which I can not break	19.620595547890066
I have promised to escort to the Acadmie a Greek princess of my acquaintance who has never seen your grand opera and who relies on me to conduct her thither	132.34749970395245
Adieu then sir and do not forget the prescription	98.88939034524155
Ah in truth madame to do that I must forget the hours conversation I have had with you which is indeed impossible	110.20142711678866
Monte Cristo bowed and left the house	15.246664594646584
Madame de Villefort remained immersed in thought	229.50304665285353
He is a very strange man she said and in my opinion is himself the Adelmonte he talks about	160.87633646964468
As to Monte Cristo the result had surpassed his utmost expectations	1155.8691539568392
Good said he as he went away this is a fruitful soil and I feel certain that the seed sown will not be cast on barren ground	333.69798622642054
Next morning faithful to his promise he sent the prescription requested	487.8762791455749
The pretext of an opera engagement was so much the more feasible as there chanced to be on that very night a more than ordinary attraction at the Acadmie Royale	356.87486476006325
Levasseur who had been suffering under severe illness made his reappearance in the character of Bertram and as usual the announcement of the most admired production of the favorite composer of the day had attracted a brilliant and fashionable audience	254.21822338392874
Morcerf like most other young men of rank and fortune had his orchestra stall with the certainty of always finding a seat in at least a dozen of the principal boxes occupied by persons of his acquaintance he had moreover his right of entry into the omnibus box	155.5757542062565
ChteauRenaud rented a stall beside his own while Beauchamp as a journalist had unlimited range all over the theatre	218.71396997824004
It happened that on this particular night the ministers box was placed at the disposal of Lucien Debray who offered it to the Comte de Morcerf who again upon his rejection of it by Mercds sent it to Danglars with an intimation that he should probably do himself the honor of joining the baroness and her daughter during the evening in the event of their accepting the box in question	90.87427227725563
The ladies received the offer with too much pleasure to dream of a refusal	96.0178216516891
To no class of persons is the presentation of a gratuitous operabox more acceptable than to the wealthy millionaire who still hugs economy while boasting of carrying a kings ransom in his waistcoat pocket	543.7533083651598
Danglars had however protested against showing himself in a ministerial box declaring that his political principles and his parliamentary position as member of the opposition party would not permit him so to commit himself the baroness had therefore despatched a note to Lucien Debray bidding him call for them it being wholly impossible for her to go alone with Eugnie to the opera	214.90963882305607
There is no gainsaying the fact that a very unfavorable construction would have been put upon the circumstance if the two women had gone without escort while the addition of a third in the person of her mothers admitted lover enabled Mademoiselle Danglars to defy malice and illnature	238.6365113433886
One must take the world as one finds it	277.4136570270531
The curtain rose as usual to an almost empty house it being one of the absurdities of Parisian fashion never to appear at the opera until after the beginning of the performance so that the first act is generally played without the slightest attention being paid to it that part of the audience already assembled being too much occupied in observing the fresh arrivals while nothing is heard but the noise of opening and shutting doors and the buzz of conversation	204.07366948255924
Surely said Albert as the door of a box on the first circle opened that must be the Countess G	112.53781192750093
And who is the Countess G inquired ChteauRenaud	219.14505689944224
What a question Now do you know baron I have a great mind to pick a quarrel with you for asking it as if all the world did not know who the Countess G was	85.24891859574467
Ah to be sure replied ChteauRenaud the lovely Venetian is it not	152.55043535457534
At this moment the countess perceived Albert and returned his salutation with a smile	77.70743107713719
You know her it seems said ChteauRenaud	30.18977728169201
Franz introduced me to her at Rome replied Albert	308.8142014285451
Well then will you do as much for me in Paris as Franz did for you in Rome	117.78986459553437
There was a cry of Shut up from the audience	221.04715188150954
This manifestation on the part of the spectators of their wish to be allowed to hear the music produced not the slightest effect on the two young men who continued their conversation	47.505772987799006
The countess was present at the races in the ChampdeMars said ChteauRenaud	110.94039901981877
Bless me I quite forgot the races	616.3508254675103
Oh merely a paltry fifty louis	41.993705628252485
But there were three races were there not	75.79100697655409
Yes there was the prize given by the Jockey Cluba gold cup you knowand a very singular circumstance occurred about that race	569.6525572570424
Oh shut up again interposed some of the audience	54.651787756188746
Why it was won by a horse and rider utterly unknown on the course	175.0643236852704
The fact was nobody had observed a horse entered by the name of Vampa or that of a jockey styled Job when at the last moment a splendid roan mounted by a jockey about as big as your fist presented themselves at the startingpost	214.74985770532282
They were obliged to stuff at least twenty pounds weight of shot in the small riders pockets to make him weight but with all that he outstripped Ariel and Barbare against whom he ran by at least three whole lengths	466.30182704469485
And was it not found out at last to whom the horse and jockey belonged	326.8377134197098
You say that the horse was entered under the name of Vampa	73.79378410588107
Then answered Albert I am better informed than you are and know who the owner of that horse was	55.88490193147473
Shut up there cried the pit in chorus	852.9782060032788
And this time the tone and manner in which the command was given betokened such growing hostility that the two young men perceived for the first time that the mandate was addressed to them	112.50689294140332
Leisurely turning round they calmly scrutinized the various countenances around them as though demanding some one person who would take upon himself the responsibility of what they deemed excessive impertinence but as no one responded to the challenge the friends turned again to the front of the theatre and affected to busy themselves with the stage	198.10670408724766
At this moment the door of the ministers box opened and Madame Danglars accompanied by her daughter entered escorted by Lucien Debray who assiduously conducted them to their seats	122.71073739261122
Ha ha said ChteauRenaud here come some friends of yours viscount What are you looking at there do nt you see they are trying to catch your eye	100.56902434342652
Albert turned round just in time to receive a gracious wave of the fan from the baroness as for Mademoiselle Eugnie she scarcely vouchsafed to waste the glances of her large black eyes even upon the business of the stage	133.7023068357003
I tell you what my dear fellow said ChteauRenaud I can not imagine what objection you can possibly have to Mademoiselle Danglarsthat is setting aside her want of ancestry and somewhat inferior rank which by the way I do nt think you care very much about	141.71322224666793
Now barring all that I mean to say she is a deuced fine girl	119.20619228669544
Handsome certainly replied Albert but not to my taste which I confess inclines to something softer gentler and more feminine	644.4770197128898
Ah well exclaimed ChteauRenaud who because he had seen his thirtieth summer fancied himself duly warranted in assuming a sort of paternal air with his more youthful friend you young people are never satisfied why what would you have more your parents have chosen you a bride built on the model of Diana the huntress and yet you are not content	245.45695648195306
No for that very resemblance affrights me I should have liked something more in the manner of the Venus of Milo or Capua but this chaseloving Diana continually surrounded by her nymphs gives me a sort of alarm lest she should some day bring on me the fate of Acton	289.83212225226464
And indeed it required but one glance at Mademoiselle Danglars to comprehend the justness of Morcerfs remark	298.185873416447
She was beautiful but her beauty was of too marked and decided a character to please a fastidious taste her hair was raven black but its natural waves seemed somewhat rebellious her eyes of the same color as her hair were surmounted by wellarched brows whose great defect however consisted in an almost habitual frown while her whole physiognomy wore that expression of firmness and decision so little in accordance with the gentler attributes of her sexher nose was precisely what a sculptor would have chosen for a chiselled Juno	368.5056195287644
Her mouth which might have been found fault with as too large displayed teeth of pearly whiteness rendered still more conspicuous by the brilliant carmine of her lips contrasting vividly with her naturally pale complexion	622.7441268548358
But that which completed the almost masculine look Morcerf found so little to his taste was a dark mole of much larger dimensions than these freaks of nature generally are placed just at the corner of her mouth and the effect tended to increase the expression of selfdependence that characterized her countenance	318.0537553109965
The rest of Mademoiselle Eugnies person was in perfect keeping with the head just described she indeed reminded one of Diana as ChteauRenaud observed but her bearing was more haughty and resolute	393.4872499368115
As regarded her attainments the only fault to be found with them was the same that a fastidious connoisseur might have found with her beauty that they were somewhat too erudite and masculine for so young a person	214.12818539924217
She was a perfect linguist a firstrate artist wrote poetry and composed music to the study of the latter she professed to be entirely devoted following it with an indefatigable perseverance assisted by a schoolfellowa young woman without fortune whose talent promised to develop into remarkable powers as a singer	526.7030067887132
It was rumored that she was an object of almost paternal interest to one of the principal composers of the day who excited her to spare no pains in the cultivation of her voice which might hereafter prove a source of wealth and independence	120.22998356452044
But this counsel effectually decided Mademoiselle Danglars never to commit herself by being seen in public with one destined for a theatrical life and acting upon this principle the bankers daughter though perfectly willing to allow Mademoiselle Louise dArmilly that was the name of the young virtuosa to practice with her through the day took especial care not to be seen in her company	163.6008887576693
Still though not actually received at the Htel Danglars in the light of an acknowledged friend Louise was treated with far more kindness and consideration than is usually bestowed on a governess	232.12858623350974
The curtain fell almost immediately after the entrance of Madame Danglars into her box the band quitted the orchestra for the accustomed halfhours interval allowed between the acts and the audience were left at liberty to promenade the salon or lobbies or to pay and receive visits in their respective boxes	302.7436792732165
Morcerf and ChteauRenaud were amongst the first to avail themselves of this permission	77.42345531197861
For an instant the idea struck Madame Danglars that this eagerness on the part of the young viscount arose from his impatience to join her party and she whispered her expectations to her daughter that Albert was hurrying to pay his respects to them	70.49105919763008
Mademoiselle Eugnie however merely returned a dissenting movement of the head while with a cold smile she directed the attention of her mother to an opposite box on the first circle in which sat the Countess G and where Morcerf had just made his appearance	98.00820780662357
So we meet again my travelling friend do we cried the countess extending her hand to him with all the warmth and cordiality of an old acquaintance it was really very good of you to recognize me so quickly and still more so to bestow your first visit on me	108.54281901440167
Be assured replied Albert that if I had been aware of your arrival in Paris and had known your address I should have paid my respects to you before this	39.652265415865585
Allow me to introduce my friend Baron de ChteauRenaud one of the few true gentlemen now to be found in France and from whom I have just learned that you were a spectator of the races in the ChampdeMars yesterday	84.15921267410059
So you were at the races baron inquired the countess eagerly	1450.6741323939054
Well then pursued Madame G with considerable animation you can probably tell me who won the Jockey Club stakes	227.17642741312244
I am sorry to say I can not replied the baron and I was just asking the same question of Albert	59.2229723017609
Are you very anxious to know countess asked Albert	488.33727422389535
The name of the owner of the winning horse	177.3923505323389
Excessively only imaginebut do tell me viscount whether you really are acquainted with it or no	96.77009829423073
I beg your pardon madame but you were about to relate some story were you not You said only imagineand then paused	308.1001486247442
You must know I felt so interested in the splendid roan horse with his elegant little rider so tastefully dressed in a pink satin jacket and cap that I could not help praying for their success with as much earnestness as though the half of my fortune were at stake and when I saw them outstrip all the others and come to the winningpost in such gallant style I actually clapped my hands with joy	194.62960173644504
Imagine my surprise when upon returning home the first object I met on the staircase was the identical jockey in the pink jacket I concluded that by some singular chance the owner of the winning horse must live in the same hotel as myself but as I entered my apartments I beheld the very gold cup awarded as a prize to the unknown horse and rider	171.2835260738755
Inside the cup was a small piece of paper on which were written these wordsFrom Lord Ruthven to Countess G	138.33757499293296
Precisely I was sure of it said Morcerf	25.756082593071373
That the owner of the horse was Lord Ruthven himself	228.0006148655129
What Lord Ruthven do you mean	22.728302939127754
Why our Lord Ruthventhe Vampire of the Salle Argentina	193.70166874865419
Is it possible exclaimed the countess is he here in Paris	97.8715119924718
And you visit himmeet him at your own house and elsewhere	56.07112110108544
I assure you he is my most intimate friend and M	89.50038673266747
de ChteauRenaud has also the honor of his acquaintance	21.09753353565826
But why are you so sure of his being the winner of the Jockey Club prize	364.8050991347579
Was not the winning horse entered by the name of Vampa	57.84865017200499
Why do you not recollect the name of the celebrated bandit by whom I was made prisoner	127.65119492506604
And from whose hands the count extricated me in so wonderful a manner	180.72420351826383
To be sure I remember it all now	57.36662658088048
You see its evident where the count got the name	48.78130406386857
But what could have been his motive for sending the cup to me	91.82887734834566
In the first place because I had spoken much of you to him as you may believe and in the second because he delighted to see a countrywoman take so lively an interest in his success	140.91696818735232
I trust and hope you never repeated to the count all the foolish remarks we used to make about him	132.48454149730173
I should not like to affirm upon oath that I have not	138.7293273162683
Besides his presenting you the cup under the name of Lord Ruthven	87.31911493015927
Oh but that is dreadful Why the man must owe me a fearful grudge	192.47608967713634
Does his action appear like that of an enemy	26.386057126932954
And so he is in Paris	28.009823671018413
And what effect does he produce	11764.612592030815
Why said Albert he was talked about for a week then the coronation of the queen of England took place followed by the theft of Mademoiselle Marss diamonds and so people talked of something else	150.5135749555519
My good fellow said ChteauRenaud the count is your friend and you treat him accordingly	81.38340061337435
Do not believe what Albert is telling you countess so far from the sensation excited in the Parisian circles by the appearance of the Count of Monte Cristo having abated I take upon myself to declare that it is as strong as ever	60.67310202758503
His first astounding act upon coming amongst us was to present a pair of horses worth 32000 francs to Madame Danglars his second the almost miraculous preservation of Madame de Villeforts life now it seems that he has carried off the prize awarded by the Jockey Club	135.49229721708272
I therefore maintain in spite of Morcerf that not only is the count the object of interest at this present moment but also that he will continue to be so for a month longer if he pleases to exhibit an eccentricity of conduct which after all may be his ordinary mode of existence	126.26375489817848
Perhaps you are right said Morcerf meanwhile who is in the Russian ambassadors box	593.9468113939652
Which box do you mean asked the countess	22.120742322854532
The one between the pillars on the first tierit seems to have been fitted up entirely afresh	341.2618836344966
Did you observe anyone during the first act asked ChteauRenaud	61.53346803816446
No replied the countess it was certainly empty during the first act then resuming the subject of their previous conversation she said And so you really believe it was your mysterious Count of Monte Cristo that gained the prize	104.69528308478729
And who afterwards sent the cup to me	38.90734380156712
But I do nt know him said the countess I have a great mind to return it	40.066120218594676
Do no such thing I beg of you he would only send you another formed of a magnificent sapphire or hollowed out of a gigantic ruby	177.1608979517153
It is his way and you must take him as you find him	37.90129001736852
At this moment the bell rang to announce the drawing up of the curtain for the second act	62.257684401776785
Albert rose to return to his place	47.44542765984629
Shall I see you again asked the countess	19.112285917893715
At the end of the next act with your permission I will come and inquire whether there is anything I can do for you in Paris	66.82437080005586
Pray take notice said the countess that my present residence is 22 Rue de Rivoli and that I am at home to my friends every Saturday evening	168.22418300819766
So now you are both forewarned	56117.90641229722
The young men bowed and quitted the box	130.1184097149055
Upon reaching their stalls they found the whole of the audience in the parterre standing up and directing their gaze towards the box formerly possessed by the Russian ambassador	183.72350632821676
A man of from thirtyfive to forty years of age dressed in deep black had just entered accompanied by a young woman dressed after the Eastern style	69.39828486703841
The lady was surpassingly beautiful while the rich magnificence of her attire drew all eyes upon her	182.72288146657004
Hullo said Albert it is Monte Cristo and his Greek	115.72783591108825
The strangers were indeed no other than the count and Hayde	47.998878856152984
In a few moments the young girl had attracted the attention of the whole house and even the occupants of the boxes leaned forward to scrutinize her magnificent diamonds	105.56461138178507
The second act passed away during one continued buzz of voicesone deep whisperintimating that some great and universally interesting event had occurred all eyes all thoughts were occupied with the young and beautiful woman whose gorgeous apparel and splendid jewels made a most extraordinary spectacle	451.7679781551098
Upon this occasion an unmistakable sign from Madame Danglars intimated her desire to see Albert in her box directly the curtain fell on the second act and neither the politeness nor good taste of Morcerf would permit his neglecting an invitation so unequivocally given	203.88910473524928
At the close of the act he therefore went to the baroness	95.98638531457438
Having bowed to the two ladies he extended his hand to Debray	58.86480382173777
By the baroness he was most graciously welcomed while Eugnie received him with her accustomed coldness	639.4106026319907
My dear fellow said Debray you have come in the nick of time	75.87056755389655
There is madame overwhelming me with questions respecting the count she insists upon it that I can tell her his birth education and parentage where he came from and whither he is going	178.70012906121525
Being no disciple of Cagliostro I was wholly unable to do this so by way of getting out of the scrape I said Ask Morcerf he has got the whole history of his beloved Monte Cristo at his fingers ends whereupon the baroness signified her desire to see you	119.29157149038637
Is it not almost incredible said Madame Danglars that a person having at least half a million of secretservice money at his command should possess so little information	123.65342615931084
Let me assure you madame said Lucien that had I really the sum you mention at my disposal I would employ it more profitably than in troubling myself to obtain particulars respecting the Count of Monte Cristo whose only merit in my eyes consists in his being twice as rich as a nabob	132.0128566512548
However I have turned the business over to Morcerf so pray settle it with him as may be most agreeable to you for my own part I care nothing about the count or his mysterious doings	145.29247042989613
I am very sure no nabob would have sent me a pair of horses worth 32000 francs wearing on their heads four diamonds valued at 5000 francs each	147.1305860313228
He seems to have a mania for diamonds said Morcerf smiling and I verily believe that like Potemkin he keeps his pockets filled for the sake of strewing them along the road as Tom Thumb did his flint stones	442.4687720805521
Perhaps he has discovered some mine said Madame Danglars	64.45543666267434
I suppose you know he has an order for unlimited credit on the barons banking establishment	281.624239023313
I was not aware of it replied Albert but I can readily believe it	43.22562900596697
And further that he stated to M	28.251713157884964
Danglars his intention of only staying a year in Paris during which time he proposed to spend six millions	120.08863623732424
He must be the Shah of Persia travelling incog	2346.374835568574
Have you noticed the remarkable beauty of the young woman M	58.25501389048289
I really never met with one woman so ready to do justice to the charms of another as yourself responded Lucien raising his lorgnette to his eye	155.29468209263993
A most lovely creature upon my soul was his verdict	377.50857103614544
Who is this young person M	192.83926783389407
de Morcerf inquired Eugnie does anybody know	1282.7076908132071
Mademoiselle said Albert replying to this direct appeal I can give you very exact information on that subject as well as on most points relative to the mysterious person of whom we are now conversingthe young woman is a Greek	156.73357068715325
So I should suppose by her dress if you know no more than that everyone here is as wellinformed as yourself	83.209444564487
I am extremely sorry you find me so ignorant a cicerone replied Morcerf but I am reluctantly obliged to confess I have nothing further to communicateyes stay I do know one thing more namely that she is a musician for one day when I chanced to be breakfasting with the count I heard the sound of a guzlait is impossible that it could have been touched by any other finger than her own	113.68045971774019
Then your count entertains visitors does he asked Madame Danglars	97.06357605896476
Indeed he does and in a most lavish manner I can assure you	49.59959836262088
I must try and persuade M	399.04958178140174
Danglars to invite him to a ball or dinner or something of the sort that he may be compelled to ask us in return	107.22135042527721
What said Debray laughing do you really mean you would go to his house	22.06925503185204
Why not my husband could accompany me	32.98321022026322
But do you know this mysterious count is a bachelor	360.66584717396626
You have ample proof to the contrary if you look opposite said the baroness as she laughingly pointed to the beautiful Greek	128.29350391186978
No no exclaimed Debray that girl is not his wife he told us himself she was his slave	143.5945493479845
Do you not recollect Morcerf his telling us so at your breakfast	314.96304127212835
Well then said the baroness if slave she be she has all the air and manner of a princess	223.06287485485274
If you like but tell me my dear Lucien what it is that constitutes a princess	131.3179241501144
Why diamondsand she is covered with them	23.716717836769558
To me she seems overloaded observed Eugnie she would look far better if she wore fewer and we should then be able to see her finely formed throat and wrists	305.8665925949169
See how the artist peeps out exclaimed Madame Danglars	98.6352185743177
My poor Eugnie you must conceal your passion for the fine arts	166.97262348845234
I admire all that is beautiful returned the young lady	138.33324119342254
What do you think of the count inquired Debray he is not much amiss according to my ideas of good looks	190.64495460338225
The count repeated Eugnie as though it had not occurred to her to observe him sooner the countoh he is so dreadfully pale	165.82225618617275
I quite agree with you said Morcerf and the secret of that very pallor is what we want to find out	80.78585603736542
The Countess G insists upon it that he is a vampire	63.52886085763604
Then the Countess G has returned to Paris has she inquired the baroness	44.25123749199193
Is that she mamma asked Eugnie almost opposite to us with that profusion of beautiful light hair	169.75192569677344
Yes said Madame Danglars that is she	49.71247762593339
Shall I tell you what you ought to do Morcerf	44.53633010923654
Well then you should go and bring your Count of Monte Cristo to us	22.844206788805796
What for Why to converse with him of course	65.18753869019491
Have you really no desire to meet him	16.875716909604733
He will very probably come of his own accord said Morcerf	78.62941415584281
There do you see madame he recognizes you and bows	439.7279014552397
The baroness returned the salute in the most smiling and graceful manner	84.34209239505667
Well said Morcerf I may as well be magnanimous and tear myself away to forward your wishes	359.2861024821869
Adieu I will go and try if there are any means of speaking to him	72.13255416361774
Go straight to his box that will be the simplest plan	306.6892333584085
But I have never been presented	236.90675525523275
You say she is only a slave	115.2075008352464
While you assert that she is a queen or at least a princess	43.891442599187435
No I hope that when he sees me leave you he will come out	42.5219088033132
I am going said Albert as he made his parting bow	92.51513023809153
Just as he was passing the counts box the door opened and Monte Cristo came forth	40.5243240057355
After giving some directions to Ali who stood in the lobby the count took Alberts arm	73.14115647100944
Carefully closing the box door Ali placed himself before it while a crowd of spectators assembled round the Nubian	134.72071557526235
Upon my word said Monte Cristo Paris is a strange city and the Parisians a very singular people	104.47869313268369
See that cluster of persons collected around poor Ali who is as much astonished as themselves really one might suppose he was the only Nubian they had ever beheld	247.7296787327121
Now I can promise you that a Frenchman might show himself in public either in Tunis Constantinople Bagdad or Cairo without being treated in that way	236.00069530289468
That shows that the Eastern nations have too much good sense to waste their time and attention on objects undeserving of either	360.1124576818814
However as far as Ali is concerned I can assure you the interest he excites is merely from the circumstance of his being your attendantyou who are at this moment the most celebrated and fashionable person in Paris	148.5965466295049
Really and what has procured me so flattering a distinction	156.83775726657424
What why yourself to be sure You give away horses worth a thousand louis you save the lives of ladies of high rank and beauty under the name of Major Black you run thoroughbreds ridden by tiny urchins not larger than marmots then when you have carried off the golden trophy of victory instead of setting any value on it you give it to the first handsome woman you think of	303.4542913466716
And who has filled your head with all this nonsense	119.70600247830201
Why in the first place I heard it from Madame Danglars who by the by is dying to see you in her box or to have you seen there by others secondly I learned it from Beauchamps journal and thirdly from my own imagination	134.09979340629621
Why if you sought concealment did you call your horse Vampa	225.22888204897916
That was an oversight certainly replied the count but tell me does the Count of Morcerf never visit the Opera I have been looking for him but without success	54.73649104368426
In what part of the house	175.6587757044218
In the baronesss box I believe	400.4559523608373
That charming young woman with her is her daughter	82.28617406749656
We will discuss that subject at length some future time said he	67.80283406012066
But what do you think of the music	97.8027930251672
Why the music you have been listening to	50.93927617964632
Oh it is well enough as the production of a human composer sung by featherless bipeds to quote the late Diogenes	737.4588355146116
From which it would seem my dear count that you can at pleasure enjoy the seraphic strains that proceed from the seven choirs of paradise	431.0538254653649
You are right in some degree when I wish to listen to sounds more exquisitely attuned to melody than mortal ear ever yet listened to I go to sleep	211.51122392133027
Then sleep here my dear count	3.4638002134446286
The conditions are favorable what else was opera invented for	916.7904551529813
To sleep after the manner I speak of absolute calm and silence are necessary and then a certain preparation	261.43656289502394
So my dear viscount whenever you wish to be regaled with music come and sup with me	93.79249814326295
I have already enjoyed that treat when breakfasting with you said Morcerf	454.8443321026714
Ah then I suppose you heard Haydes guzla the poor exile frequently beguiles a weary hour in playing over to me the airs of her native land	1424.9397772272043
Morcerf did not pursue the subject and Monte Cristo himself fell into a silent reverie	89.04027564371476
The bell rang at this moment for the rising of the curtain	36.58577028501672
You will excuse my leaving you said the count turning in the direction of his box	19.775574557603182
Pray say everything that is kind to Countess G on the part of her friend the vampire	133.6424185206231
And what message shall I convey to the baroness	102.21404102307388
That with her permission I shall do myself the honor of paying my respects in the course of the evening	28.777519230794397
The third act had begun and during its progress the Count of Morcerf according to his promise made his appearance in the box of Madame Danglars	50.4080296171802
The Count of Morcerf was not a person to excite either interest or curiosity in a place of public amusement his presence therefore was wholly unnoticed save by the occupants of the box in which he had just seated himself	115.8374667778737
The quick eye of Monte Cristo however marked his coming and a slight though meaning smile passed over his lips	110.63898693054726
Hayde whose soul seemed centred in the business of the stage like all unsophisticated natures delighted in whatever addressed itself to the eye or ear	324.02216589957004
The third act passed off as usual	71.82861485762677
Mesdemoiselles Noblet Julia and Leroux executed the customary pirouettes Robert duly challenged the Prince of Granada and the royal father of the princess Isabella taking his daughter by the hand swept round the stage with majestic strides the better to display the rich folds of his velvet robe and mantle	315.1141643265081
After which the curtain again fell and the spectators poured forth from the theatre into the lobbies and salon	189.02686119068483
The count left his box and a moment later was saluting the Baronne Danglars who could not restrain a cry of mingled pleasure and surprise	132.26500387372215
You are welcome count she exclaimed as he entered	46.045503160141195
I have been most anxious to see you that I might repeat orally the thanks writing can so ill express	457.67168327496444
Surely so trifling a circumstance can not deserve a place in your remembrance	95.84003554217307
Believe me madame I had entirely forgotten it	216.4868958780571
But it is not so easy to forget monsieur that the very next day after your princely gift you saved the life of my dear friend Madame de Villefort which was endangered by the very animals your generosity restored to me	117.16589017244178
This time at least I do not deserve your thanks	97.73604898330002
It was Ali my Nubian slave who rendered this service to Madame de Villefort	49.97160707018644
Was it Ali asked the Count of Morcerf who rescued my son from the hands of bandits	39.05075088859124
No count replied Monte Cristo taking the hand held out to him by the general in this instance I may fairly and freely accept your thanks but you have already tendered them and fully discharged your debtif indeed there existed oneand I feel almost mortified to find you still reverting to the subject	280.87412101040155
May I beg of you baroness to honor me with an introduction to your daughter	88.81513532837675
Oh you are no strangerat least not by name replied Madame Danglars and the last two or three days we have really talked of nothing but you	59.65807234699218
Eugnie continued the baroness turning towards her daughter this is the Count of Monte Cristo	12.665033609479305
The count bowed while Mademoiselle Danglars bent her head slightly	27.143763587767204
You have a charming young person with you tonight count said Eugnie	175.84054649688062
No mademoiselle said Monte Cristo astonished at the coolness and freedom of the question	125.71339423385372
She is a poor unfortunate Greek left under my care	761.7382908890355
A Greek murmured the Count of Morcerf	4.261280183276376
Yes indeed count said Madame Danglars and tell me did you ever see at the court of Ali Tepelini whom you so gloriously and valiantly served a more exquisite beauty or richer costume	143.50496550469694
Did I hear rightly monsieur said Monte Cristo that you served at Yanina	28.97076018972214
I was inspectorgeneral of the pashas troops replied Morcerf and it is no secret that I owe my fortune such as it is to the liberality of the illustrious Albanese chief	143.659780689691
There said Monte Cristo placing his arms around the count and leaning with him over the front of the box just as Hayde whose eyes were occupied in examining the theatre in search of her guardian perceived his pale features close to Morcerfs face	80.34926650662429
It was as if the young girl beheld the head of Medusa	128.19999669963562
She bent forwards as though to assure herself of the reality of what she saw then uttering a faint cry threw herself back in her seat	77.83225030583073
The sound was heard by the people about Ali who instantly opened the boxdoor	327.30344711726286
Why count exclaimed Eugnie what has happened to your ward she seems to have been taken suddenly ill	119.87876828328089
But do not be alarmed on her account	64.5083567172108
Haydes nervous system is delicately organized and she is peculiarly susceptible to the odors even of flowersnay there are some which cause her to faint if brought into her presence	578.8379190105005
However continued Monte Cristo drawing a small phial from his pocket I have an infallible remedy	58.91451828454122
So saying he bowed to the baroness and her daughter exchanged a parting shake of the hand with Debray and the count and left Madame Danglars box	73.07314817391655
Upon his return to Hayde he found her still very pale	132.01691787531468
As soon as she saw him she seized his hand her own hands were moist and icy cold	92.89924557310354
Who was it you were talking with over there she asked	203.6853095793561
With the Count of Morcerf answered Monte Cristo	29.222165182255164
He tells me he served your illustrious father and that he owes his fortune to him	58.38395980226086
Wretch exclaimed Hayde her eyes flashing with rage he sold my father to the Turks and the fortune he boasts of was the price of his treachery Did not you know that my dear lord	125.22156403265538
Something of this I heard in Epirus said Monte Cristo but the particulars are still unknown to me	46.36546017982528
You shall relate them to me my child	35.65234023527901
They are no doubt both curious and interesting	761.7330725726587
Yes yes but let us go	9.96483356974573
I feel as though it would kill me to remain long near that dreadful man	115.34058335625369
So saying Hayde arose and wrapping herself in her burnouse of white cashmere embroidered with pearls and coral she hastily quitted the box at the moment when the curtain was rising upon the fourth act	146.65925884575287
Do you observe said the Countess G to Albert who had returned to her side that man does nothing like other people he listens most devoutly to the third act of Robert le Diable and when the fourth begins takes his departure	269.57185726669877
Some days after this meeting Albert de Morcerf visited the Count of Monte Cristo at his house in the Champslyses which had already assumed that palacelike appearance which the counts princely fortune enabled him to give even to his most temporary residences	105.78881854898097
He came to renew the thanks of Madame Danglars which had been already conveyed to the count through the medium of a letter signed Baronne Danglars ne Hermine de Servieux	118.96621812129999
Albert was accompanied by Lucien Debray who joining in his friends conversation added some passing compliments the source of which the counts talent for finesse easily enabled him to guess	314.5026088824942
He was convinced that Luciens visit was due to a double feeling of curiosity the larger half of which sentiment emanated from the Rue de la Chausse dAntin	98.95274786314533
In short Madame Danglars not being able personally to examine in detail the domestic economy and household arrangements of a man who gave away horses worth 30000 francs and who went to the opera with a Greek slave wearing diamonds to the amount of a million of money had deputed those eyes by which she was accustomed to see to give her a faithful account of the mode of life of this incomprehensible person	146.07976336739566
But the count did not appear to suspect that there could be the slightest connection between Luciens visit and the curiosity of the baroness	120.75817993716576
You are in constant communication with the Baron Danglars the count inquired of Albert de Morcerf	55.174573934476456
Yes count you know what I told you	15.343017632371689
All remains the same then in that quarter	66.81227975519242
It is more than ever a settled thing said Lucienand considering that this remark was all that he was at that time called upon to make he adjusted the glass to his eye and biting the top of his gold headed cane began to make the tour of the apartment examining the arms and the pictures	147.0697429095212
Ah said Monte Cristo I did not expect that the affair would be so promptly concluded	60.103060988533386
Oh things take their course without our assistance	326.28779805860586
While we are forgetting them they are falling into their appointed order and when again our attention is directed to them we are surprised at the progress they have made towards the proposed end	190.8670613392924
Danglars served together in Spain my father in the army and M	34.55077714212646
It was there that my father ruined by the revolution and M	177.54033798109762
Danglars who never had possessed any patrimony both laid the foundations of their different fortunes	715.9951145322932
Yes said Monte Cristo I think M	99.49623747996455
Danglars mentioned that in a visit which I paid him and continued he casting a sideglance at Lucien who was turning over the leaves of an album Mademoiselle Eugnie is prettyI think I remember that to be her name	190.9529915452148
Very pretty or rather very beautiful replied Albert but of that style of beauty which I do not appreciate I am an ungrateful fellow	136.1367103463027
You speak as if you were already her husband	81.17656939564964
Ah returned Albert in his turn looking around to see what Lucien was doing	154.49649110901768
Really said Monte Cristo lowering his voice you do not appear to me to be very enthusiastic on the subject of this marriage	28.232305432321226
Mademoiselle Danglars is too rich for me replied Morcerf and that frightens me	96.68195375773158
Bah exclaimed Monte Cristo that s a fine reason to give	36.89464504413829
My fathers income is about 50000 francs per annum and he will give me perhaps ten or twelve thousand when I marry	48.89077149421554
That perhaps might not be considered a large sum in Paris especially said the count but everything does not depend on wealth and it is a fine thing to have a good name and to occupy a high station in society	79.61481237004539
Your name is celebrated your position magnificent and then the Comte de Morcerf is a soldier and it is pleasing to see the integrity of a Bayard united to the poverty of a Duguesclin disinterestedness is the brightest ray in which a noble sword can shine	155.0801429043069
As for me I consider the union with Mademoiselle Danglars a most suitable one she will enrich you and you will ennoble her	107.37161875479359
Albert shook his head and looked thoughtful	395.5780017866426
There is still something else said he	16.199429175773982
I confess observed Monte Cristo that I have some difficulty in comprehending your objection to a young lady who is both rich and beautiful	89.20604969812283
Oh said Morcerf this repugnance if repugnance it may be called is not all on my side	132.71979601020237
Whence can it arise then for you told me your father desired the marriage	85.81291994616318
It is my mother who dissents she has a clear and penetrating judgment and does not smile on the proposed union	478.48773122975507
I can not account for it but she seems to entertain some prejudice against the Danglars	205.65830763250355
Ah said the count in a somewhat forced tone that may be easily explained the Comtesse de Morcerf who is aristocracy and refinement itself does not relish the idea of being allied by your marriage with one of ignoble birth that is natural enough	121.31708100730172
I do not know if that is her reason said Albert but one thing I do know that if this marriage be consummated it will render her quite miserable	113.11646625893698
There was to have been a meeting six weeks ago in order to talk over and settle the affair but I had such a sudden attack of indisposition	138.07874373922292
Oh real enough from anxiety doubtlessat any rate they postponed the matter for two months	458.754723845
There is no hurry you know	27.437393645317034
I am not yet twentyone and Eugnie is only seventeen but the two months expire next week	320.56687017132595
My dear count you can not imagine how my mind is harassed	116.38810440334399
How happy you are in being exempt from all this	237.04442164817493
Well and why should not you be free too What prevents you from being so	217.07825625878328
Oh it will be too great a disappointment to my father if I do not marry Mademoiselle Danglars	39.06990186304807
Marry her then said the count with a significant shrug of the shoulders	57.26608243059374
Yes replied Morcerf but that will plunge my mother into positive grief	547.8974349729576
Then do not marry her said the count	8.260162124302603
I will try and think over what is the best thing to be done you will give me your advice will you not and if possible extricate me from my unpleasant position I think rather than give pain to my dear mother I would run the risk of offending the count	86.29409693511641
Monte Cristo turned away he seemed moved by this last remark	225.85899034332684
Ah said he to Debray who had thrown himself into an easychair at the farthest extremity of the salon and who held a pencil in his right hand and an account book in his left what are you doing there Are you making a sketch after Poussin	109.77299613671855
Oh no was the tranquil response I am too fond of art to attempt anything of that sort	182.2542893471708
I am doing a little sum in arithmetic	654.766288820892
Yes I am calculatingby the way Morcerf that indirectly concerns youI am calculating what the house of Danglars must have gained by the last rise in Haiti bonds from 206 they have risen to 409 in three days and the prudent banker had purchased at 206 therefore he must have made 300000 livres	406.85115203783613
That is not his biggest scoop said Morcerf did he not make a million in Spaniards this last year	144.1984306843368
My dear fellow said Lucien here is the Count of Monte Cristo who will say to you as the Italians do	21.1736086409285
When they tell me such things I only shrug my shoulders and say nothing	208.1029056337246
But you were speaking of Haitians said Monte Cristo	45.82064448534796
Ah Haitiansthat is quite another thing Haitians are the cart of French stockjobbing	589.790235758622
We may like bouillotte delight in whist be enraptured with boston and yet grow tired of them all but we always come back to cartit is not only a game it is a horsduvre M	343.20085349008446
Danglars sold yesterday at 405 and pockets 300000 francs	244.77134466661872
Had he but waited till today the price would have fallen to 205 and instead of gaining 300000 francs he would have lost 20 or 25000	178.5402387975225
And what has caused the sudden fall from 409 to 206 asked Monte Cristo	332.80027300277953
I am profoundly ignorant of all these stockjobbing intrigues	714.5021119691669
Because said Albert laughing one piece of news follows another and there is often great dissimilarity between them	540.2127981214418
Ah said the count I see that M	36.23802387791115
Danglars is accustomed to play at gaining or losing 300000 francs in a day he must be enormously rich	236.91557508418498
It is not he who plays exclaimed Lucien it is Madame Danglars she is indeed daring	188.81546782744314
But you who are a reasonable being Lucien and who knows how little dependence is to be placed on the news since you are at the fountainhead surely you ought to prevent it said Morcerf with a smile	68.12778624442784
How can I if her husband fails in controlling her asked Lucien you know the character of the baronessno one has any influence with her and she does precisely what she pleases	214.73050188925296
Ah if I were in your place said Albert	28.62109424477695
I would reform her it would be rendering a service to her future soninlaw	187.10299119995076
How would you set about it	37.88015306272138
Ah that would be easy enoughI would give her a lesson	349.6702945720906
Your position as secretary to the minister renders your authority great on the subject of political news you never open your mouth but the stockbrokers immediately stenograph your words	461.70695674508636
Cause her to lose a hundred thousand francs and that would teach her prudence	90.53869837224748
I do not understand stammered Lucien	1198.42071617259
It is very clear notwithstanding replied the young man with an artlessness wholly free from affectation tell her some fine morning an unheardof piece of intelligencesome telegraphic despatch of which you alone are in possession for instance that Henri IV	260.19666767915305
That would boom the market she will buy heavily and she will certainly lose when Beauchamp announces the following day in his gazette The report circulated by some usually wellinformed persons that the king was seen yesterday at Gabrielles house is totally without foundation	517.3930573954078
We can positively assert that his majesty did not quit the PontNeuf	112.06929650620391
Monte Cristo although apparently indifferent had not lost one word of this conversation and his penetrating eye had even read a hidden secret in the embarrassed manner of the secretary	103.84408327430164
This embarrassment had completely escaped Albert but it caused Lucien to shorten his visit he was evidently ill at ease	317.05316556732686
The count in taking leave of him said something in a low voice to which he answered Willingly count I accept	106.13121601541702
The count returned to young Morcerf	11517.4853842735
Do you not think on reflection said he to him that you have done wrong in thus speaking of your motherinlaw in the presence of M	90.06465240783999
My dear count said Morcerf I beg of you not to apply that title so prematurely	77.63852110706254
Now speaking without any exaggeration is your mother really so very much averse to this marriage	201.24941995066092
So much so that the baroness very rarely comes to the house and my mother has not I think visited Madame Danglars twice in her whole life	113.26505637092585
Then said the count I am emboldened to speak openly to you	219.37100268811105
de Villefort has overwhelmed me with politeness in return for a service which a casual piece of good fortune enabled me to render him	107.2975624626848
I predict from all this an avalanche of dinners and routs	1528.8188977854813
Now in order not to presume on this and also to be beforehand with them I have if agreeable to you thought of inviting M	222.75888682813778
and Madame de Villefort to my countryhouse at Auteuil	741.111891570101
If I were to invite you and the Count and Countess of Morcerf to this dinner I should give it the appearance of being a matrimonial meeting or at least Madame de Morcerf would look upon the affair in that light especially if Baron Danglars did me the honor to bring his daughter	90.28686670278117
In that case your mother would hold me in aversion and I do not at all wish that on the contrary I desire to stand high in her esteem	101.79775322778151
Indeed count said Morcerf I thank you sincerely for having used so much candor towards me and I gratefully accept the exclusion which you propose	258.31803608842216
You say you desire my mothers good opinion I assure you it is already yours to a very unusual extent	141.37872120016402
Do you think so said Monte Cristo with interest	21.288873183301742
Oh I am sure of it we talked of you an hour after you left us the other day	78.33939168924523
But to return to what we were saying	46.61785565112099
If my mother could know of this attention on your partand I will venture to tell herI am sure that she will be most grateful to you it is true that my father will be equally angry	70.23247582425334
Well said he to Morcerf but I think your father will not be the only angry one M	58.17382644617455
and Madame Danglars will think me a very illmannered person	223.0896480683544
They know that I am intimate with youthat you are in fact one of the oldest of my Parisian acquaintancesand they will not find you at my house they will certainly ask me why I did not invite you	71.04401846235962
Be sure to provide yourself with some previous engagement which shall have a semblance of probability and communicate the fact to me by a line in writing	162.81854552355009
You know that with bankers nothing but a written document will be valid	580.6344802347821
I will do better than that said Albert my mother is wishing to go to the seasidewhat day is fixed for your dinner	143.6855399083246
This is Tuesdaywell tomorrow evening we leave and the day after we shall be at Trport	64.14672934291227
Really count you have a delightful way of setting people at their ease	304.07043761284484
Indeed you give me more credit than I deserve I only wish to do what will be agreeable to you that is all	52.106040163520746
When shall you send your invitations	28694.002205525296
Well I will immediately call on M	70.20442328320438
Danglars and tell him that my mother and myself must leave Paris tomorrow	116.49494081176611
I have not seen you consequently I know nothing of your dinner	140.229637122598
How foolish you are Have you forgotten that M	68.33946539259811
Debray has just seen you at my house	24.659525119469176
I have seen you and invited you without any ceremony when you instantly answered that it would be impossible for you to accept as you were going to Trport	102.41659497098681
Well then that is settled but you will come and call on my mother before tomorrow	62.31246439921456
Before tomorrowthat will be a difficult matter to arrange besides I shall just be in the way of all the preparations for departure	98.49427624468947
You were only a charming man before but if you accede to my proposal you will be adorable	119.82277625600035
What must I do to attain such sublimity	3964.3850329122433
You are today free as aircome and dine with me we shall be a small partyonly yourself my mother and I	177.0722878238971
You have scarcely seen my mother you shall have an opportunity of observing her more closely	88.4655241707215
She is a remarkable woman and I only regret that there does not exist another like her about twenty years younger in that case I assure you there would very soon be a Countess and Viscountess of Morcerf	115.93293410711425
As to my father you will not see him he is officially engaged and dines with the chief referendary	218.32668058904142
We will talk over our travels and you who have seen the whole world will relate your adventuresyou shall tell us the history of the beautiful Greek who was with you the other night at the Opera and whom you call your slave and yet treat like a princess	80.52522288531556
We will talk Italian and Spanish	12909.087479283726
Come accept my invitation and my mother will thank you	49.3034162544943
A thousand thanks said the count your invitation is most gracious and I regret exceedingly that it is not in my power to accept it	72.74307576923432
I am not so much at liberty as you suppose on the contrary I have a most important engagement	55.31014459506354
Ah take care you were teaching me just now how in case of an invitation to dinner one might creditably make an excuse	333.3730224322063
I require the proof of a preengagement	864.4313119728625
I am not a banker like M	177.3203126742643
Danglars but I am quite as incredulous as he is	137.69656720859305
I am going to give you a proof replied the count and he rang the bell	22.94859754602794
Humph said Morcerf this is the second time you have refused to dine with my mother it is evident that you wish to avoid her	34.75925192724355
Oh you do not mean that said he besides here comes the confirmation of my assertion	245.05488942532142
Baptistin entered and remained standing at the door	4.790847338614134
I had no previous knowledge of your visit had I	60.421440264148394
Indeed you are such an extraordinary person that I would not answer for it	46.77970279541199
At all events I could not guess that you would invite me to dinner	56.985158871058616
Well listen Baptistin what did I tell you this morning when I called you into my laboratory	60.56611276098534
To close the door against visitors as soon as the clock struck five replied the valet	80.4541899659121
Ah my dear count said Albert	129.96971529937795
No no I wish to do away with that mysterious reputation that you have given me my dear viscount it is tiresome to be always acting Manfred	133.0718480847831
I wish my life to be free and open	187.6397371799189
Then to admit no one except Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti and his son	139.26522130055426
You hearMajor Bartolomeo Cavalcantia man who ranks amongst the most ancient nobility of Italy whose name Dante has celebrated in the tenth canto of The Inferno you remember it do you not Then there is his son Andrea a charming young man about your own age viscount bearing the same title as yourself and who is making his entry into the Parisian world aided by his fathers millions	148.34482751731207
The major will bring his son with him this evening the contino as we say in Italy he confides him to my care	181.56286468308454
If he proves himself worthy of it I will do what I can to advance his interests	46.02425262739507
You will assist me in the work will you not	46.60268525972525
This Major Cavalcanti is an old friend of yours then	41.30450641428988
He is a perfect nobleman very polite modest and agreeable such as may be found constantly in Italy descendants of very ancient families	471.9095359391432
I have met him several times at Florence Bologna and Lucca and he has now communicated to me the fact of his arrival in Paris	118.7025687834645
The acquaintances one makes in travelling have a sort of claim on one they everywhere expect to receive the same attention which you once paid them by chance as though the civilities of a passing hour were likely to awaken any lasting interest in favor of the man in whose society you may happen to be thrown in the course of your journey	132.7815712143815
This good Major Cavalcanti is come to take a second view of Paris which he only saw in passing through in the time of the Empire when he was on his way to Moscow	78.30312080181108
I shall give him a good dinner he will confide his son to my care I will promise to watch over him I shall let him follow in whatever path his folly may lead him and then I shall have done my part	88.4353950645572
Certainly I see you are a model Mentor said Albert Goodbye we shall return on Sunday	593.7682992021046
By the way I have received news of Franz	244.83054146191373
Have you Is he still amusing himself in Italy	358.4599660966792
I believe so however he regrets your absence extremely	7601.11462435809
He says you were the sun of Rome and that without you all appears dark and cloudy I do not know if he does not even go so far as to say that it rains	95.02377467030875
His opinion of me is altered for the better then	139.91833705305316
No he still persists in looking upon you as the most incomprehensible and mysterious of beings	234.25180419406064
He is a charming young man said Monte Cristo and I felt a lively interest in him the very first evening of my introduction when I met him in search of a supper and prevailed upon him to accept a portion of mine	82.01224776758596
He is I think the son of General dpinay	49.74310304491911
The same who was so shamefully assassinated in 1815	2429.259578558665
Really I like him extremely is there not also a matrimonial engagement contemplated for him	595.6957914363985
Yes he is to marry Mademoiselle de Villefort	8.13705236370667
And you know I am to marry Mademoiselle Danglars said Albert laughing	20.603625625988588
I smile because there appears to me to be about as much inclination for the consummation of the engagement in question as there is for my own	83.54610967611319
But really my dear count we are talking as much of women as they do of us it is unpardonable	140.53524687510054
Really that is a good ideatwo hours have I been boring you to death with my company and then you with the greatest politeness ask me if I am going	151.55365665677303
Indeed count you are the most polished man in the world	35.964866047001074
And your servants too how very well behaved they are there is quite a style about them	185.8380359066083
Monsieur Baptistin especially I could never get such a man as that	69.88444789090647
My servants seem to imitate those you sometimes see in a play who because they have only a word or two to say aquit themselves in the most awkward manner possible	238.03136892149024
Therefore if you part with M	150.13611564417423
Baptistin give me the refusal of him	23.045790485695466
That is not all give my compliments to your illustrious Luccanese Cavalcante of the Cavalcanti and if by any chance he should be wishing to establish his son find him a wife very rich very noble on her mothers side at least and a baroness in right of her father I will help you in the search	127.19081020836298
Ah ha you will do as much as that will you	25.302822825747228
Well really nothing is certain in this world	27.33394429514971
Oh count what a service you might render me I should like you a hundred times better if by your intervention I could manage to remain a bachelor even were it only for ten years	124.67223275188653
Nothing is impossible gravely replied Monte Cristo and taking leave of Albert he returned into the house and struck the gong three times	48.73332651539886
Monsieur Bertuccio you understand that I intend entertaining company on Saturday at Auteuil	788.4951765443337
I shall require your services to see that all be properly arranged	193.02925729676457
It is a beautiful house or at all events may be made so	53.35094609629524
There must be a good deal done before it can deserve that title your excellency for the tapestried hangings are very old	283.27450551947345
Let them all be taken away and changed then with the exception of the sleepingchamber which is hung with red damask you will leave that exactly as it is	78.82734147450246
You will not touch the garden either as to the yard you may do what you please with it I should prefer that being altered beyond all recognition	167.0602979659021
I will do everything in my power to carry out your wishes your excellency	54.034770212102636
I should be glad however to receive your excellencys commands concerning the dinner	401.3759713906666
Bertuccio said the count since you have been in Paris you have become quite nervous and apparently out of your element you no longer seem to understand me	63.615194475467256
But surely your excellency will be so good as to inform me whom you are expecting to receive	32.68839902125312
I do not yet know myself neither is it necessary that you should do so	46.57460636172933
Lucullus dines with Lucullus that is quite sufficient	89.39744832641159
Bertuccio bowed and left the room	2.2542438457193517
Both the count and Baptistin had told the truth when they announced to Morcerf the proposed visit of the major which had served Monte Cristo as a pretext for declining Alberts invitation	194.77665445543022
Seven oclock had just struck and M	136.9672857806977
Bertuccio according to the command which had been given him had two hours before left for Auteuil when a cab stopped at the door and after depositing its occupant at the gate immediately hurried away as if ashamed of its employment	128.53753439384124
The visitor was about fiftytwo years of age dressed in one of the green surtouts ornamented with black frogs which have so long maintained their popularity all over Europe	148.87076896503203
He wore trousers of blue cloth boots tolerably clean but not of the brightest polish and a little too thick in the soles buckskin gloves a hat somewhat resembling in shape those usually worn by the gendarmes and a black cravat striped with white which if the proprietor had not worn it of his own free will might have passed for a halter so much did it resemble one	301.293281472756
Such was the picturesque costume of the person who rang at the gate and demanded if it was not at No	64.48702651513408
30 in the Avenue des Champslyses that the Count of Monte Cristo lived and who being answered by the porter in the affirmative entered closed the gate after him and began to ascend the steps	37.538044031798826
The small and angular head of this man his white hair and thick gray moustaches caused him to be easily recognized by Baptistin who had received an exact description of the expected visitor and who was awaiting him in the hall	96.51664431179618
Therefore scarcely had the stranger time to pronounce his name before the count was apprised of his arrival	80.52002401248261
He was ushered into a simple and elegant drawingroom and the count rose to meet him with a smiling air	62.274054358215274
Ah my dear sir you are most welcome I was expecting you	69.46264544440123
Indeed said the Italian was your excellency then aware of my visit	226.0824599798397
Yes I had been told that I should see you today at seven oclock	31.630121041438368
Then you have received full information concerning my arrival	178.03478293757559
Ah so much the better I feared this little precaution might have been forgotten	140.82001317660104
That of informing you beforehand of my coming	111.50513437216416
But you are sure you are not mistaken	14.872360564825716
It really was I whom your excellency expected at seven oclock this evening	85.49875688741282
I will prove it to you beyond a doubt	140.22522100470553
Oh no never mind that said the Italian it is not worth the trouble	45.45961804191733
Let me see said the count are you not the Marquis Bartolomeo Cavalcanti	86.93421105218367
Bartolomeo Cavalcanti joyfully replied the Italian yes I am really he	102.78673788836791
Was I a major timidly asked the old soldier	50.52024410378546
Yes said Monte Cristo you were a major that is the title the French give to the post which you filled in Italy	151.31907331792237
Very good said the major I do not demand more you understand	58.422904625942145
Your visit here today is not of your own suggestion is it said Monte Cristo	52.12968477648235
You were sent by some other person	121.6796293160074
Exactly so said the delighted major	18802.468986011114
And Monte Cristo took the letter which he opened and read	34.47448501906712
The major looked at the count with his large staring eyes and then took a survey of the apartment but his gaze almost immediately reverted to the proprietor of the room	70.54877564178987
Major Cavalcanti a worthy patrician of Lucca a descendant of the Cavalcanti of Florence continued Monte Cristo reading aloud possessing an income of half a million	171.16443477924585
Monte Cristo raised his eyes from the paper and bowed	59.4106846681823
Half a million said he magnificent	112712.54600046185
Half a million is it said the major	47.75857559232621
Yes in so many words and it must be so for the abb knows correctly the amount of all the largest fortunes in Europe	97.17643293435137
Be it half a million then but on my word of honor I had no idea that it was so much	41.56894087464562
Because you are robbed by your steward	207.6925487247455
You must make some reformation in that quarter	37.83565174458648
You have opened my eyes said the Italian gravely I will show the gentlemen the door	86.15516027143795
Monte Cristo resumed the perusal of the letter	10.00165885722932
And who only needs one thing more to make him happy	52.38893327321476
Yes indeed but one said the major with a sigh	21.000133988975925
Which is to recover a lost and adored son	1295.1758337691897
Stolen away in his infancy either by an enemy of his noble family or by the gypsies	110.07083376600708
At the age of five years said the major with a deep sigh and raising his eye to heaven	20.907918856353838
I have given him renewed life and hope in the assurance that you have the power of restoring the son whom he has vainly sought for fifteen years	82.83658648269261
The major looked at the count with an indescribable expression of anxiety	16.337212282797694
I have the power of so doing said Monte Cristo	39.141739851403884
So then said he the letter was true to the end	69.90143006315637
Did you doubt it my dear Monsieur Bartolomeo	150.7919764600985
No indeed certainly not a good man a man holding religious office as does the Abb Busoni could not condescend to deceive or play off a joke but your excellency has not read all	218.0297831868583
Ah true said Monte Cristo there is a postscript	71.73284464392897
Yes yes repeated the major yesthereisapostscript	94423.6054955062
In order to save Major Cavalcanti the trouble of drawing on his banker I send him a draft for 2000 francs to defray his travelling expenses and credit on you for the further sum of 48000 francs which you still owe me	114.96436889119191
The major awaited the conclusion of the postscript apparently with great anxiety	162.30291217586304
He said very good muttered the major thensir replied he	434.0254882202166
Then the postscript is as favorably received by you as the rest of the letter	81.41807056263758
Certainly the Abb Busoni and myself have a small account open between us	174.27524001240025
I do not remember if it is exactly 48000 francs which I am still owing him but I dare say we shall not dispute the difference	89.37415400424375
You attached great importance then to this postscript my dear Monsieur Cavalcanti	191.82139127104978
I must explain to you said the major that fully confiding in the signature of the Abb Busoni I had not provided myself with any other funds so that if this resource had failed me I should have found myself very unpleasantly situated in Paris	97.15363659374837
Is it possible that a man of your standing should be embarrassed anywhere said Monte Cristo	111.03265353964974
Why really I know no one said the major	15.379844776340258
But then you yourself are known to others	181.4176820339926
Yes I am known so that	38.981981531602024
So that you will remit to me these 48000 francs	69.01328122315455
The majors eyes dilated with pleasing astonishment	344.44282944838716
But sit down said Monte Cristo really I do not know what I have been thinking ofI have positively kept you standing for the last quarter of an hour	53.26339400303947
The major drew an armchair towards him and proceeded to seat himself	51.023608753116974
Now said the count what will you takea glass of sherry port or Alicante	541.5806856349863
Alicante if you please it is my favorite wine	123.77589766657833
I have some that is very good	38.27616450900265
You will take a biscuit with it will you not	31.218122289581753
Yes I will take a biscuit as you are so obliging	218.13787259651176
The count advanced to meet him	3.03765697933286
Well said he in a low voice	3.112176536524633
The young man is here said the valet de chambre in the same tone	10.682204231845065
Into what room did you take him	26.136248646784406
Into the blue drawingroom according to your excellencys orders	293.9366337109408
That s right now bring the Alicante and some biscuits	645.6530216948248
Really said the major I am quite ashamed of the trouble I am giving you	90.0918126903281
Pray do nt mention such a thing said the count	16.74585529513864
Baptistin reentered with glasses wine and biscuits	623.3490502040148
The count filled one glass but in the other he only poured a few drops of the rubycolored liquid	124.35524195114935
The bottle was covered with spiders webs and all the other signs which indicate the age of wine more truly than do wrinkles on a mans face	334.2157361423055
The major made a wise choice he took the full glass and a biscuit	109.9294180607159
The count told Baptistin to leave the plate within reach of his guest who began by sipping the Alicante with an expression of great satisfaction and then delicately steeped his biscuit in the wine	159.17513362828944
So sir you lived at Lucca did you You were rich noble held in great esteemhad all that could render a man happy	375.29519044720894
All said the major hastily swallowing his biscuit positively all	2671.7416949107082
And yet there was one thing wanting in order to complete your happiness	183.7696262829672
Only one thing said the Italian	366.4244574617473
And that one thing your lost child	713.9602194363346
Ah said the major taking a second biscuit that consummation of my happiness was indeed wanting	293.2994909528531
The worthy major raised his eyes to heaven and sighed	16.511409777729742
Let me hear then said the count who this deeply regretted son was for I always understood you were a bachelor	176.68419760467629
That was the general opinion sir said the major and I	24.29105703890221
Yes replied the count and you confirmed the report	115.49898440233494
A youthful indiscretion I suppose which you were anxious to conceal from the world at large	146.5135338273351
The major recovered himself and resumed his usual calm manner at the same time casting his eyes down either to give himself time to compose his countenance or to assist his imagination all the while giving an underlook at the count the protracted smile on whose lips still announced the same polite curiosity	178.30498993990423
Yes said the major I did wish this fault to be hidden from every eye	177.9356993642122
Not on your own account surely replied Monte Cristo for a man is above that sort of thing	81.24934521959948
Oh no certainly not on my own account said the major with a smile and a shake of the head	23.97711466928032
But for the sake of the mother said the count	34.36814907974663
Yes for the mothers sakehis poor mother cried the major taking a third biscuit	207.43434493055915
Take some more wine my dear Cavalcanti said the count pouring out for him a second glass of Alicante your emotion has quite overcome you	92.44659907464734
His poor mother murmured the major trying to get the lachrymal gland in operation so as to moisten the corner of his eye with a false tear	196.65040362881814
She belonged to one of the first families in Italy I think did she not	82.84758006917514
She was of a noble family of Fiesole count	372.95264310342526
Do you desire to know her name	123.65018422299764
Oh said Monte Cristo it would be quite superfluous for you to tell me for I already know it	55.8774719167577
The count knows everything said the Italian bowing	141.89808372621346
And you married her at last notwithstanding the opposition of her family	109.31276225772055
Yes that was the way it ended	2930.6283855675556
And you have doubtless brought all your papers with you said Monte Cristo	21.373622098035295
The certificate of your marriage with Oliva Corsinari and the register of your childs birth	398.34871509783204
The register of my childs birth	1145.9324171640624
The register of the birth of Andrea Cavalcantiof your son is not his name Andrea	134.82865454212177
I believe so said the major	491.21071377133705
I dare not positively assert it as he has been lost for so long a time	23.181434662808808
Well then said Monte Cristo you have all the documents with you	49.28133652282562
Your excellency I regret to say that not knowing it was necessary to come provided with these papers I neglected to bring them	109.23210564958605
That is unfortunate returned Monte Cristo	1.002474069630473
The major passed his hand across his brow	8.470517067136038
Certainly they were supposing there were to be doubts raised as to the validity of your marriage or the legitimacy of your child	109.82974776326934
True said the major there might be doubts raised	564.3825384279829
In that case your son would be very unpleasantly situated	434.5394553790464
It would be fatal to his interests	317.312993827229
It might cause him to fail in some desirable matrimonial alliance	1595.2288255166272
You must know that in France they are very particular on these points it is not sufficient as in Italy to go to the priest and say We love each other and want you to marry us	76.33564919177832
Marriage is a civil affair in France and in order to marry in an orthodox manner you must have papers which undeniably establish your identity	179.96265823253515
That is the misfortune You see I have not these necessary papers	175.90310172279166
Fortunately I have them though said Monte Cristo	6.875662754910823
Ah indeed said the major who seeing the object of his journey frustrated by the absence of the papers feared also that his forgetfulness might give rise to some difficulty concerning the 48000 francsah indeed that is a fortunate circumstance yes that really is lucky for it never occurred to me to bring them	175.19103023145536
I do not at all wonder at itone can not think of everything but happily the Abb Busoni thought for you	195.07332090699754
He is extremely prudent and thoughtful	25411.030080719873
He is an admirable man said the major and he sent them to you	41.47922471217279
The major clasped his hands in token of admiration	32.471169727976374
You married Oliva Corsinari in the church of San Paolo del MonteCattini here is the priests certificate	391.47747222341803
Yes indeed there it is truly said the Italian looking on with astonishment	149.59637422760838
And here is Andrea Cavalcantis baptismal register given by the cur of Saravezza	627.8612948177682
Take these documents then they do not concern me	30.13717864332304
You will give them to your son who will of course take great care of them	111.03993008152266
I should think so indeed If he were to lose them	111.4206264436215
Well and if he were to lose them said Monte Cristo	26.791316621582066
In that case replied the major it would be necessary to write to the cur for duplicates and it would be some time before they could be obtained	69.3051368644621
It would be a difficult matter to arrange said Monte Cristo	59.81611189651421
Almost an impossibility replied the major	163.60890702048852
I am very glad to see that you understand the value of these papers	47.44686648886719
Now said Monte Cristo as to the mother of the young man	17.285738290663293
As to the mother of the young man repeated the Italian with anxiety	53.250449854582826
Really said the major difficulties seem to thicken upon us will she be wanted in any way	206.08060322264407
No sir replied Monte Cristo besides has she not	277.3014226544203
Yes sir said the major she has	879.6370904201311
Paid the last debt of nature	844.3735646782462
I knew that said Monte Cristo she has been dead these ten years	70.88918355308202
And I am still mourning her loss exclaimed the major drawing from his pocket a checked handkerchief and alternately wiping first the left and then the right eye	209.62953710890517
What would you have said Monte Cristo we are all mortal	30.294792009079792
Now you understand my dear Monsieur Cavalcanti that it is useless for you to tell people in France that you have been separated from your son for fifteen years	37.046503971728875
Stories of gypsies who steal children are not at all in vogue in this part of the world and would not be believed	69.57052999923533
You sent him for his education to a college in one of the provinces and now you wish him to complete his education in the Parisian world	117.90142563944322
That is the reason which has induced you to leave Via Reggio where you have lived since the death of your wife	103.43542476291908
If they should hear of the separation	228.60509695353008
Ah yes what could I say	81.77165470535414
That an unfaithful tutor bought over by the enemies of your family	53.92586113677825
Had stolen away this child in order that your name might become extinct	188.06331843509614
That is reasonable since he is an only son	62.825224691474
Well now that all is arranged do not let these newly awakened remembrances be forgotten	893.8259903818386
You have doubtless already guessed that I was preparing a surprise for you	68.62915103856365
An agreeable one asked the Italian	293.6801654304768
Ah I see the eye of a father is no more to be deceived than his heart	34.21215275049903
Someone has told you the secret or perhaps you guessed that he was here	124.16366770023369
I did guess it replied the major with the greatest possible coolness	103.16726317100559
He is said Monte Cristo when the valet de chambre came in just now he told me of his arrival	47.69601680609451
Ah very well very well said the major clutching the buttons of his coat at each exclamation	110.69432880129101
My dear sir said Monte Cristo I understand your emotion you must have time to recover yourself	62.16301218788301
I will in the meantime go and prepare the young man for this muchdesired interview for I presume that he is not less impatient for it than yourself	134.6521857567441
I should quite imagine that to be the case said Cavalcanti	67.05899032325999
Well in a quarter of an hour he shall be with you	25.894127227589394
You will bring him then You carry your goodness so far as even to present him to me yourself	102.93840869460023
No I do not wish to come between a father and son	154.82030823712785
But do not be uneasy even if the powerful voice of nature should be silent you can not well mistake him he will enter by this door	136.84143794887893
He is a fine young man of fair complexiona little too fair perhapspleasing in manners but you will see and judge for yourself	257.14703021571916
By the way said the major you know I have only the 2000 francs which the Abb Busoni sent me this sum I have expended upon travelling expenses and	100.60761043207441
And you want money that is a matter of course my dear M	50.965883427327604
Well here are 8000 francs on account	161.2103874244281
It is 40000 francs which I now owe you said Monte Cristo	21.511431162644087
Does your excellency wish for a receipt said the major at the same time slipping the money into the inner pocket of his coat	53.97135213555655
I thought you might want it to show the Abb Busoni	60.414029175667864
Well when you receive the remaining 40000 you shall give me a receipt in full	222.8793167613322
Between honest men such excessive precaution is I think quite unnecessary	402.50927316635574
Yes so it is between perfectly upright people	7606.824741869782
One word more said Monte Cristo	1.0012661218997359
You will permit me to make one remark	181.24466469887415
Then I should advise you to leave off wearing that style of dress	247.41037775803903
Indeed said the major regarding himself with an air of complete satisfaction	70.14193281804508
It may be worn at Via Reggio but that costume however elegant in itself has long been out of fashion in Paris	547.2127857212793
Oh if you really are attached to your old mode of dress you can easily resume it when you leave Paris	124.45744726329674
What you find in your trunks	20595.520984465886
In my trunks I have but one portmanteau	801.7199143941104
I dare say you have nothing else with you	22.171538594503946
What is the use of boring ones self with so many things Besides an old soldier always likes to march with as little baggage as possible	351.05323719176556
That is just the caseprecisely so	220.24006812721615
But you are a man of foresight and prudence therefore you sent your luggage on before you	340.41818700355367
It has arrived at the Htel des Princes Rue de Richelieu	25.504216113595366
It is there you are to take up your quarters	187.08961819868495
I presume you have given orders to your valet de chambre to put in all you are likely to needyour plain clothes and your uniform	129.64811896964187
On grand occasions you must wear your uniform that will look very well	184.353681051723
They still laugh at them in France and yet always wear them for all that	126.5349730605282
Very well very well said the major who was in ecstasy at the attention paid him by the count	76.07392993981327
Now said Monte Cristo that you have fortified yourself against all painful excitement prepare yourself my dear M	172.94387234509296
Cavalcanti to meet your lost Andrea	508.6222835766901
Saying which Monte Cristo bowed and disappeared behind the tapestry leaving the major fascinated beyond expression with the delightful reception which he had received at the hands of the count	81.78045279273617
The Count of Monte Cristo entered the adjoining room which Baptistin had designated as the drawingroom and found there a young man of graceful demeanor and elegant appearance who had arrived in a cab about half an hour previously	67.14920807032226
Baptistin had not found any difficulty in recognizing the person who presented himself at the door for admittance	95.49277912363031
He was certainly the tall young man with light hair red beard black eyes and brilliant complexion whom his master had so particularly described to him	63.10574843722836
When the count entered the room the young man was carelessly stretched on a sofa tapping his boot with the goldheaded cane which he held in his hand	44.527142578745604
On perceiving the count he rose quickly	62.15489724079693
The Count of Monte Cristo I believe said he	73.07502264636294
Yes sir and I think I have the honor of addressing Count Andrea Cavalcanti	26.39209317459721
Count Andrea Cavalcanti repeated the young man accompanying his words with a bow	68.41695333929731
You are charged with a letter of introduction addressed to me are you not said the count	26.710334517459742
I did not mention that because the signature seemed to me so strange	85.73986765061545
The letter signed Sinbad the Sailor is it not	25.949451798369704
Now as I have never known any Sinbad with the exception of the one celebrated in the Thousand and One Nights	124.6027110230807
Well it is one of his descendants and a great friend of mine he is a very rich Englishman eccentric almost to insanity and his real name is Lord Wilmore	122.58985375788285
Ah indeed Then that explains everything that is extraordinary said Andrea	90.1844307335037
He is then the same Englishman whom I metatahyes indeed	411.76645751153546
Well monsieur I am at your service	15.59537055007913
If what you say be true replied the count smiling perhaps you will be kind enough to give me some account of yourself and your family	42.049371153806064
Certainly I will do so said the young man with a quickness which gave proof of his ready invention	111.92535617561563
I am as you have said the Count Andrea Cavalcanti son of Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti a descendant of the Cavalcanti whose names are inscribed in the golden book at Florence	88.1321129951256
Our family although still rich for my fathers income amounts to half a million has experienced many misfortunes and I myself was at the age of five years taken away by the treachery of my tutor so that for fifteen years I have not seen the author of my existence	86.97208302091849
Since I have arrived at years of discretion and become my own master I have been constantly seeking him but all in vain	183.62274851560736
At length I received this letter from your friend which states that my father is in Paris and authorizes me to address myself to you for information respecting him	71.76046648663875
Really all you have related to me is exceedingly interesting said Monte Cristo observing the young man with a gloomy satisfaction and you have done well to conform in everything to the wishes of my friend Sinbad for your father is indeed here and is seeking you	59.47949249723026
The count from the moment of first entering the drawingroom had not once lost sight of the expression of the young mans countenance he had admired the assurance of his look and the firmness of his voice but at these words so natural in themselves Your father is indeed here and is seeking you young Andrea started and exclaimed My father Is my father here	75.28103613511699
Most undoubtedly replied Monte Cristo your father Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti	208.89044759233494
The expression of terror which for the moment had overspread the features of the young man had now disappeared	36.4431363882804
Ah yes that is the name certainly	1221.431908822165
And you really mean to say monsieur that my dear father is here	60.44223507531422
Yes sir and I can even add that I have only just left his company	131.5071154205575
The history which he related to me of his lost son touched me to the quick indeed his griefs hopes and fears on that subject might furnish material for a most touching and pathetic poem	398.7820577715993
At length he one day received a letter stating that the abductors of his son now offered to restore him or at least to give notice where he might be found on condition of receiving a large sum of money by way of ransom	96.58507415663378
Your father did not hesitate an instant and the sum was sent to the frontier of Piedmont with a passport signed for Italy	113.47782879993837
You were in the south of France I think	15.969605506055405
Yes replied Andrea with an embarrassed air I was in the south of France	83.28446960135922
A carriage was to await you at Nice	507.2409736154422
Precisely so and it conveyed me from Nice to Genoa from Genoa to Turin from Turin to Chambry from Chambry to PontdeBeauvoisin and from PontdeBeauvoisin to Paris	567.6742614952306
Indeed Then your father ought to have met with you on the road for it is exactly the same route which he himself took and that is how we have been able to trace your journey to this place	59.51858112622501
But said Andrea if my father had met me I doubt if he would have recognized me I must be somewhat altered since he last saw me	83.61465623447576
Oh the voice of nature said Monte Cristo	7.706489561492794
True interrupted the young man I had not looked upon it in that light	58.0109511118016
Now replied Monte Cristo there is only one source of uneasiness left in your fathers mind which is thishe is anxious to know how you have been employed during your long absence from him how you have been treated by your persecutors and if they have conducted themselves towards you with all the deference due to your rank	100.30777146283005
Finally he is anxious to see if you have been fortunate enough to escape the bad moral influence to which you have been exposed and which is infinitely more to be dreaded than any physical suffering he wishes to discover if the fine abilities with which nature had endowed you have been weakened by want of culture and in short whether you consider yourself capable of resuming and retaining in the world the high position to which your rank entitles you	175.29287463186822
Sir exclaimed the young man quite astounded I hope no false report	456.8837368763896
As for myself I first heard you spoken of by my friend Wilmore the philanthropist	304.65242117081846
I believe he found you in some unpleasant position but do not know of what nature for I did not ask not being inquisitive	143.73614712927312
Your misfortunes engaged his sympathies so you see you must have been interesting	62.224306860218505
He told me that he was anxious to restore you to the position which you had lost and that he would seek your father until he found him	75.09363189673323
He did seek and has found him apparently since he is here now and finally my friend apprised me of your coming and gave me a few other instructions relative to your future fortune	131.13019127615328
I am quite aware that my friend Wilmore is peculiar but he is sincere and as rich as a gold mine consequently he may indulge his eccentricities without any fear of their ruining him and I have promised to adhere to his instructions	133.21331258411655
Now sir pray do not be offended at the question I am about to put to you as it comes in the way of my duty as your patron	48.31951851891989
I would wish to know if the misfortunes which have happened to youmisfortunes entirely beyond your control and which in no degree diminish my regard for youI would wish to know if they have not in some measure contributed to render you a stranger to the world in which your fortune and your name entitle you to make a conspicuous figure	191.46607260844078
Sir returned the young man with a reassurance of manner make your mind easy on this score	173.6753919412957
Those who took me from my father and who always intended sooner or later to sell me again to my original proprietor as they have now done calculated that in order to make the most of their bargain it would be politic to leave me in possession of all my personal and hereditary worth and even to increase the value if possible	136.31695827448164
I have therefore received a very good education and have been treated by these kidnappers very much as the slaves were treated in Asia Minor whose masters made them grammarians doctors and philosophers in order that they might fetch a higher price in the Roman market	361.55961080485605
Monte Cristo smiled with satisfaction it appeared as if he had not expected so much from M	35.23108182636136
Besides continued the young man if there did appear some defect in education or offence against the established forms of etiquette I suppose it would be excused in consideration of the misfortunes which accompanied my birth and followed me through my youth	228.83196073048776
Well said Monte Cristo in an indifferent tone you will do as you please count for you are the master of your own actions and are the person most concerned in the matter but if I were you I would not divulge a word of these adventures	70.17476257237585
Your history is quite a romance and the world which delights in romances in yellow covers strangely mistrusts those which are bound in living parchment even though they be gilded like yourself	848.9791634313003
This is the kind of difficulty which I wished to represent to you my dear count	64.44896592616762
You would hardly have recited your touching history before it would go forth to the world and be deemed unlikely and unnatural	235.29442177547241
You would be no longer a lost child found but you would be looked upon as an upstart who had sprung up like a mushroom in the night	139.37680089077546
You might excite a little curiosity but it is not everyone who likes to be made the centre of observation and the subject of unpleasant remark	114.12062259990228
I agree with you monsieur said the young man turning pale and in spite of himself trembling beneath the scrutinizing look of his companion such consequences would be extremely unpleasant	78.02153763944027
Nevertheless you must not exaggerate the evil said Monte Cristo for by endeavoring to avoid one fault you will fall into another	91.62871010882962
You must resolve upon one simple and single line of conduct and for a man of your intelligence this plan is as easy as it is necessary you must form honorable friendships and by that means counteract the prejudice which may attach to the obscurity of your former life	175.10735038504788
I would offer myself as your surety and friendly adviser said Monte Cristo did I not possess a moral distrust of my best friends and a sort of inclination to lead others to doubt them too therefore in departing from this rule I should as the actors say be playing a part quite out of my line and should therefore run the risk of being hissed which would be an act of folly	214.52774890794467
However your excellency said Andrea in consideration of Lord Wilmore by whom I was recommended to you	52.175470656286265
Yes certainly interrupted Monte Cristo but Lord Wilmore did not omit to inform me my dear M	75.33971823784876
Andrea that the season of your youth was rather a stormy one	248.05239525254711
Ah said the count watching Andreas countenance I do not demand any confession from you it is precisely to avoid that necessity that your father was sent for from Lucca	130.12565406641866
He is a little stiff and pompous in his manner and he is disfigured by his uniform but when it becomes known that he has been for eighteen years in the Austrian service all that will be pardoned	122.4027278719641
We are not generally very severe with the Austrians	413.49875667901966
In short you will find your father a very presentable person I assure you	92.43811515344369
Ah sir you have given me confidence it is so long since we were separated that I have not the least remembrance of him and besides you know that in the eyes of the world a large fortune covers all defects	72.04574014073393
He is a millionairehis income is 500000 francs	62.691310739784214
Then said the young man with anxiety I shall be sure to be placed in an agreeable position	62.32166428514936
One of the most agreeable possible my dear sir he will allow you an income of 50000 livres per annum during the whole time of your stay in Paris	26.454965846693415
Then in that case I shall always choose to remain there	132.00685665897393
You can not control circumstances my dear sir man proposes and God disposes	728.5429869213683
But said he so long as I do remain in Paris and nothing forces me to quit it do you mean to tell me that I may rely on receiving the sum you just now mentioned to me	47.18197367203469
Shall I receive it from my father asked Andrea with some uneasiness	35.95518417503797
Yes you will receive it from your father personally but Lord Wilmore will be the security for the money	64.1495579337973
He has at the request of your father opened an account of 5000 francs a month at M	42.80920958618459
Danglars which is one of the safest banks in Paris	241.54197931310924
And does my father mean to remain long in Paris asked Andrea	156.09310264863623
Only a few days replied Monte Cristo	3.1719844194998252
His service does not allow him to absent himself more than two or three weeks together	51.646529932977444
Ah my dear father exclaimed Andrea evidently charmed with the idea of his speedy departure	186.71956435918034
Therefore said Monte Cristo feigning to mistake his meaningtherefore I will not for another instant retard the pleasure of your meeting	249.1100986198209
Are you prepared to embrace your worthy father	174.62609504041785
I hope you do not doubt it	54.96503726987874
Go then into the drawingroom my young friend where you will find your father awaiting you	81.17360344897699
Andrea made a low bow to the count and entered the adjoining room	12.380823218859517
Monte Cristo watched him till he disappeared and then touched a spring in a panel made to look like a picture which in sliding partly from the frame discovered to view a small opening so cleverly contrived that it revealed all that was passing in the drawingroom now occupied by Cavalcanti and Andrea	120.18738054591172
The young man closed the door behind him and advanced towards the major who had risen when he heard steps approaching him	52.48777797169559
Ah my dear father said Andrea in a loud voice in order that the count might hear him in the next room is it really you	31.589902561810884
How do you do my dear son said the major gravely	40.93695060524878
After so many years of painful separation said Andrea in the same tone of voice and glancing towards the door what a happiness it is to meet again	55.56718363348631
Indeed it is after so long a separation	136.30171183330617
Will you not embrace me sir said Andrea	45.81658006807282
If you wish it my son said the major and the two men embraced each other after the fashion of actors on the stage that is to say each rested his head on the others shoulder	76.19633930300307
Then we are once more reunited said Andrea	690.1318859635267
Why as to thatI think my dear son you must be by this time so accustomed to France as to look upon it almost as a second country	82.09551062093377
The fact is said the young man that I should be exceedingly grieved to leave it	71.38723755163511
As for me you must know I can not possibly live out of Lucca therefore I shall return to Italy as soon as I can	65.19882261519149
But before you leave France my dear father I hope you will put me in possession of the documents which will be necessary to prove my descent	38.1965500813881
Certainly I am come expressly on that account it has cost me much trouble to find you but I had resolved on giving them into your hands and if I had to recommence my search it would occupy all the few remaining years of my life	95.42591964563165
Andrea seized the certificate of his fathers marriage and his own baptismal register and after having opened them with all the eagerness which might be expected under the circumstances he read them with a facility which proved that he was accustomed to similar documents and with an expression which plainly denoted an unusual interest in the contents	104.98206066277402
When he had perused the documents an indefinable expression of pleasure lighted up his countenance and looking at the major with a most peculiar smile he said in very excellent Tuscan	153.8746372936806
Then there is no longer any such thing in Italy as being condemned to the galleys	118.86121099005068
The major drew himself up to his full height	57.20975573595371
Whywhat do you mean by that question	42.98984977083324
I mean that if there were it would be impossible to draw up with impunity two such deeds as these	89.55565393194927
In France my dear sir half such a piece of effrontery as that would cause you to be quickly despatched to Toulon for five years for change of air	167.88052812161737
Will you be good enough to explain your meaning said the major endeavoring as much as possible to assume an air of the greatest majesty	90.12439260406993
Cavalcanti said Andrea taking the major by the arm in a confidential manner how much are you paid for being my father	97.19797883181964
The major was about to speak when Andrea continued in a low voice	59.981056407287646
Nonsense I am going to set you an example of confidence they give me 50000 francs a year to be your son consequently you can understand that it is not at all likely I shall ever deny my parent	78.71955859884322
The major looked anxiously around him	10.674308860081279
Make yourself easy we are quite alone said Andrea besides we are conversing in Italian	147.0635808392274
Well then replied the major they paid me 50000 francs down	178.02742033863973
Monsieur Cavalcanti said Andrea do you believe in fairy tales	233.54654266137388
I used not to do so but I really feel now almost obliged to have faith in them	92.60436593226501
You have then been induced to alter your opinion you have had some proofs of their truth The major drew from his pocket a handful of gold	83.55389857291719
Most palpable proofs said he as you may perceive	91.1099555217762
You think then that I may rely on the counts promises	112.76330702906685
You are sure he will keep his word with me	23.68184021981779
To the letter but at the same time remember we must continue to play our respective parts	101.22806413286769
And I as a dutiful son as they choose that I shall be descended from you	95.38297502353174
Whom do you mean by they	795.7871729908521
Ma foi I can hardly tell but I was alluding to those who wrote the letter you received one did you not	91.14009701177156
Have you any knowledge of him	39.240390374250445
No I have never seen him	6.359603605270466
What did he say in the letter	53.3927432149668
You will promise not to betray me	72.35909298407772
Rest assured of that you well know that our interests are the same	73.2128431052488
Then read for yourself and the major gave a letter into the young mans hand	62.1978483037877
Andrea read in a low voice	1.3220000079236416
You are poor a miserable old age awaits you	351.59396614468
Would you like to become rich or at least independent Set out immediately for Paris and demand of the Count of Monte Cristo Avenue des Champslyses No	73.91014656792096
30 the son whom you had by the Marchesa Corsinari and who was taken from you at five years of age	78.14933364649757
This son is named Andrea Cavalcanti	11.422044384005371
In order that you may not doubt the kind intention of the writer of this letter you will find enclosed an order for 2400 francs payable in Florence at Signor Gozzis also a letter of introduction to the Count of Monte Cristo on whom I give you a draft of 48000 francs	79.5180304738403
Remember to go to the count on the 26th May at seven oclock in the evening	31.781817783174684
What do you mean said the major	30.372620325693003
I was going to say that I received a letter almost to the same effect	43.78526528811883
From an Englishman called Lord Wilmore who takes the name of Sinbad the Sailor	37.41003418210837
And of whom you have no more knowledge than I of the Abb Busoni	45.40514020670765
You are mistaken there I am ahead of you	109.95410809404183
Ah that is just what I can not tell you if I did I should make you as wise as myself which it is not my intention to do	33.2419252636851
And what did the letter contain	240342.6884789409
You are poor and your future prospects are dark and gloomy	203.34076403145022
Do you wish for a name should you like to be rich and your own master	78.89877905188034
Parbleu said the young man was it possible there could be two answers to such a question	136.37382654283408
Take the postchaise which you will find waiting at the Porte de Gnes as you enter Nice pass through Turin Chambry and PontdeBeauvoisin	357.6872875926096
Go to the Count of Monte Cristo Avenue des Champslyses on the 26th of May at seven oclock in the evening and demand of him your father	28.5957567799738
You are the son of the Marchese Cavalcanti and the Marchesa Oliva Corsinari	501.6749203183199
The marquis will give you some papers which will certify this fact and authorize you to appear under that name in the Parisian world	167.56807875532388
As to your rank an annual income of 50000 livres will enable you to support it admirably	179.17083658129243
I enclose a draft for 5000 livres payable on M	73.46267039609518
Ferrea banker at Nice and also a letter of introduction to the Count of Monte Cristo whom I have directed to supply all your wants	39.776266813495205
Humph said the major very good	59.94509671731395
You have seen the count you say	85.26910744843636
I have only just left him	25.469704838183926
And has he conformed to all that the letter specified	392.56316284857064
At all events it is neither you nor I	119.28672898563929
Why it does not much concern us do you think it does	75.19522942823713
No I agree with you there	144.80597252195238
We must play the game to the end and consent to be blindfolded	78.72668535388597
Ah you shall see I promise you I will sustain my part to admiration	131.99806377684686
I never once doubted your doing so	189.2515419019337
Monte Cristo chose this moment for reentering the drawingroom	492.67150417299956
On hearing the sound of his footsteps the two men threw themselves in each others arms and while they were in the midst of this embrace the count entered	39.82218284881133
Well marquis said Monte Cristo you appear to be in no way disappointed in the son whom your good fortune has restored to you	64.67726753855526
Ah your excellency I am overwhelmed with delight	352.0399754318905
And what are your feelings said Monte Cristo turning to the young man	6.410465248901668
As for me my heart is overflowing with happiness	335.8548459293928
Happy father happy son said the count	3.257941261197273
There is only one thing which grieves me observed the major and that is the necessity for my leaving Paris so soon	183.02986925198033
Cavalcanti I trust you will not leave before I have had the honor of presenting you to some of my friends	31.53043372252188
I am at your service sir replied the major	25.70257191361234
Now sir said Monte Cristo addressing Andrea make your confession	573.3152595967545
Cavalcanti something of the state of your finances	264.770355102491
Ma foi monsieur you have touched upon a tender chord	384.4105347656447
Do you hear what he says major	2348.5211898866282
Your son says he requires money	186.34203543472483
Well what would you have me do said the major	101.12137620001235
You should furnish him with some of course replied Monte Cristo	45.75116366247726
Yes you said the count at the same time advancing towards Andrea and slipping a packet of banknotes into the young mans hand	59.103715617628694
Yes did you not tell him just now that you wanted money Well then he deputes me to give you this	115.96100796566513
Am I to consider this as part of my income on account	162.54207627648523
No it is for the first expenses of your settling in Paris	167.6057377281731
Ah how good my dear father is	76.94127687162488
Silence said Monte Cristo he does not wish you to know that it comes from him	26.475463920702126
I fully appreciate his delicacy said Andrea cramming the notes hastily into his pocket	196.79991276010134
And now gentlemen I wish you goodmorning said Monte Cristo	48.27056575903206
And when shall we have the honor of seeing you again your excellency asked Cavalcanti	45.633192095288216
Ah said Andrea when may we hope for that pleasure	109.51759427009223
Let me seeSaturdayI am to dine at my country house at Auteuil on that day Rue de la Fontaine No	65.24835440570581
Several persons are invited and among others M	252.69811832461238
I will introduce you to him for it will be necessary he should know you as he is to pay your money	46.03190015158214
Full dress said the major half aloud	405.48912374604055
Oh yes certainly said the count uniform cross kneebreeches	4694.918140714568
And how shall I be dressed demanded Andrea	479.16891595122104
Oh very simply black trousers patent leather boots white waistcoat either a black or blue coat and a long cravat	233.68596610254733
Go to Blin or Vronique for your clothes	77.19282886942254
Baptistin will tell you where if you do not know their address	40.57987306778576
The less pretension there is in your attire the better will be the effect as you are a rich man	67.60556034094745
If you mean to buy any horses get them of Devedeux and if you purchase a phaeton go to Baptiste for it	225.5017470927666
At what hour shall we come asked the young man	13.354488183899075
We will be with you at that time said the major	45.35620457133865
The two Cavalcanti bowed to the count and left the house	9.9770437546307
Monte Cristo went to the window and saw them crossing the street arm in arm	121.7417998590978
There go two miscreants said he it is a pity they are not really related Then after an instant of gloomy reflection Come I will go to see the Morrels said he I think that disgust is even more sickening than hatred	137.06923548423197
Our readers must now allow us to transport them again to the enclosure surrounding M	113.49308987348427
de Villeforts house and behind the gate half screened from view by the large chestnuttrees which on all sides spread their luxuriant branches we shall find some people of our acquaintance	127.88736894685645
This time Maximilian was the first to arrive	98.68110742635407
He was intently watching for a shadow to appear among the trees and awaiting with anxiety the sound of a light step on the gravel walk	104.71862517139189
At length the longdesired sound was heard and instead of one figure as he had expected he perceived that two were approaching him	92.91967731040057
The delay had been occasioned by a visit from Madame Danglars and Eugnie which had been prolonged beyond the time at which Valentine was expected	79.51015722276176
That she might not appear to fail in her promise to Maximilian she proposed to Mademoiselle Danglars that they should take a walk in the garden being anxious to show that the delay which was doubtless a cause of vexation to him was not occasioned by any neglect on her part	93.71701742494197
The young man with the intuitive perception of a lover quickly understood the circumstances in which she was involuntarily placed and he was comforted	243.2501110302229
Besides although she avoided coming within speaking distance Valentine arranged so that Maximilian could see her pass and repass and each time she went by she managed unperceived by her companion to cast an expressive look at the young man which seemed to say Have patience You see it is not my fault	108.30192857063697
And Maximilian was patient and employed himself in mentally contrasting the two girlsone fair with soft languishing eyes a figure gracefully bending like a weeping willow the other a brunette with a fierce and haughty expression and as straight as a poplar	423.6831578008356
It is unnecessary to state that in the eyes of the young man Valentine did not suffer by the contrast	28.311679522342544
In about half an hour the girls went away and Maximilian understood that Mademoiselle Danglars visit had at last come to an end	143.49731570100036
In a few minutes Valentine reentered the garden alone	232.99937421595382
For fear that anyone should be observing her return she walked slowly and instead of immediately directing her steps towards the gate she seated herself on a bench and carefully casting her eyes around to convince herself that she was not watched she presently arose and proceeded quickly to join Maximilian	134.7583384678583
Goodevening Valentine said a wellknown voice	14.639326871860744
Goodevening Maximilian I know I have kept you waiting but you saw the cause of my delay	62.387634468903556
I was not aware that you were so intimate with her	45.69811312448493
Who told you we were intimate Maximilian	1028.1181414553432
No one but you appeared to be so	23.019603551592354
From the manner in which you walked and talked together one would have thought you were two schoolgirls telling your secrets to each other	216.5191052679724
We were having a confidential conversation returned Valentine she was owning to me her repugnance to the marriage with M	197.3621901327132
de Morcerf and I on the other hand was confessing to her how wretched it made me to think of marrying M	127.63649261054043
That will account to you for the unreserved manner which you observed between me and Eugnie as in speaking of the man whom I could not love my thoughts involuntarily reverted to him on whom my affections were fixed	145.60564169672335
Ah how good you are to say so Valentine You possess a quality which can never belong to Mademoiselle Danglars	117.56801659158322
It is that indefinable charm which is to a woman what perfume is to the flower and flavor to the fruit for the beauty of either is not the only quality we seek	150.41722665830432
It is your love which makes you look upon everything in that light	84.46155018481022
No Valentine I assure you such is not the case	98.55629979246527
I was observing you both when you were walking in the garden and on my honor without at all wishing to depreciate the beauty of Mademoiselle Danglars I can not understand how any man can really love her	71.31559419191129
The fact is Maximilian that I was there and my presence had the effect of rendering you unjust in your comparison	135.58524612652153
No but tell meit is a question of simple curiosity and which was suggested by certain ideas passing in my mind relative to Mademoiselle Danglars	137.7992474759416
I dare say it is something disparaging which you are going to say	131.46303964648413
It only proves how little indulgence we may expect from your sex interrupted Valentine	253.43041311488747
You can not at least deny that you are very harsh judges of each other	126.3223079092309
If we are so it is because we generally judge under the influence of excitement	84.82910906440702
Does Mademoiselle Danglars object to this marriage with M	32.0915808404602
de Morcerf on account of loving another	4482.925946154442
I told you I was not on terms of strict intimacy with Eugnie	195.78365763120942
Yes but girls tell each other secrets without being particularly intimate own now that you did question her on the subject	203.17190739283058
Ah I see you are smiling	1556.9482599433109
If you are already aware of the conversation that passed the wooden partition which interposed between us and you has proved but a slight security	185.7572784054417
She told me that she loved no one said Valentine that she disliked the idea of being married that she would infinitely prefer leading an independent and unfettered life and that she almost wished her father might lose his fortune that she might become an artist like her friend Mademoiselle Louise dArmilly	142.1748014389334
Well what does that prove asked Valentine	121.14872046285383
Why you know very well that you are reflecting on yourself Valentine	74.99756267309023
Do you want me to go away	82.3430188310473
But do not let us lose time you are the subject on which I wish to speak	47.0414719586741
True we must be quick for we have scarcely ten minutes more to pass together	69.98648734841973
Ma foi said Maximilian in consternation	1548.3622836753577
Yes you are right I am but a poor friend to you	39.20648015440051
What a life I cause you to lead poor Maximilian you who are formed for happiness I bitterly reproach myself I assure you	168.64051143035388
Well what does it signify Valentine so long as I am satisfied and feel that even this long and painful suspense is amply repaid by five minutes of your society or two words from your lips And I have also a deep conviction that heaven would not have created two hearts harmonizing as ours do and almost miraculously brought us together to separate us at last	160.5269967804645
Those are kind and cheering words	21492.454337484614
You must hope for us both Maximilian that will make me at least partly happy	113.34075069927232
But why must you leave me so soon	18.516626990869124
I can only tell you that Madame de Villefort sent to request my presence as she had a communication to make on which a part of my fortune depended	87.8617016739025
Let them take my fortune I am already too rich and perhaps when they have taken it they will leave me in peace and quietness	83.08384147285349
You would love me as much if I were poor would you not Maximilian	119.64000639376802
Oh I shall always love you	7.3094422774852585
What should I care for either riches or poverty if my Valentine was near me and I felt certain that no one could deprive me of her But do you not fear that this communication may relate to your marriage	82.67323845262395
I do not think that is the case	38.47261194655786
However it may be Valentine you must not be alarmed	26.39443167846885
I assure you that as long as I live I shall never love anyone else	47.58674772056185
Do you think to reassure me when you say that Maximilian	35.19478109552816
But I was going to tell you that I met M	21.824496362051406
Monsieur Franz is his friend you know	25.67656035916506
Monsieur de Morcerf has received a letter from Franz announcing his immediate return	260.4859138976242
Valentine turned pale and leaned her hand against the gate	37.32260055808334
Ah heavens if it were that But no the communication would not come through Madame de Villefort	78.92704387345962
BecauseI scarcely know whybut it has appeared as if Madame de Villefort secretly objected to the marriage although she did not choose openly to oppose it	124.8062914739011
Is it so Then I feel as if I could adore Madame de Villefort	45.130629239582994
Do not be in such a hurry to do that said Valentine with a sad smile	24.20562428223105
If she objects to your marrying M	1661.5289112107268
dpinay she would be all the more likely to listen to any other proposition	143.3677300602031
No Maximilian it is not suitors to which Madame de Villefort objects it is marriage itself	330.1303842438284
Marriage If she dislikes that so much why did she ever marry herself	95.19770999568435
You do not understand me Maximilian	296.0659623843346
About a year ago I talked of retiring to a convent	418.5716109885157
Madame de Villefort in spite of all the remarks which she considered it her duty to make secretly approved of the proposition my father consented to it at her instigation and it was only on account of my poor grandfather that I finally abandoned the project	138.09852159265157
You can form no idea of the expression of that old mans eye when he looks at me the only person in the world whom he loves and I had almost said by whom he is beloved in return	59.6823070824071
When he learned my resolution I shall never forget the reproachful look which he cast on me and the tears of utter despair which chased each other down his lifeless cheeks	124.41312125720772
Ah Maximilian I experienced at that moment such remorse for my intention that throwing myself at his feet I exclaimedForgive me pray forgive me my dear grandfather they may do what they will with me I will never leave you	87.07529612628929
When I had ceased speaking he thankfully raised his eyes to heaven but without uttering a word	36.56255343201778
Ah Maximilian I may have much to suffer but I feel as if my grandfathers look at that moment would more than compensate for all	97.61171260064066
Dear Valentine you are a perfect angel and I am sure I do not know what Isabring right and left among the Bedouinscan have done to merit your being revealed to me unless indeed Heaven took into consideration the fact that the victims of my sword were infidels	165.36804291138967
But tell me what interest Madame de Villefort can have in your remaining unmarried	214.37339600257596
Did I not tell you just now that I was rich Maximiliantoo rich I possess nearly 50000 livres in right of my mother my grandfather and my grandmother the Marquis and Marquise de SaintMran will leave me as much and M	171.40499511222342
Noirtier evidently intends making me his heir	144.29395037673592
My brother Edward who inherits nothing from his mother will therefore be poor in comparison with me	110.60605310320315
Now if I had taken the veil all this fortune would have descended to my father and in reversion to his son	88.31985720003655
Ah how strange it seems that such a young and beautiful woman should be so avaricious	106.13003145879519
It is not for herself that she is so but for her son and what you regard as a vice becomes almost a virtue when looked at in the light of maternal love	175.94899542893782
But could you not compromise matters and give up a portion of your fortune to her son	95.47939160405267
How could I make such a proposition especially to a woman who always professes to be so entirely disinterested	248.45632040736982
Valentine I have always regarded our love in the light of something sacred consequently I have covered it with the veil of respect and hid it in the innermost recesses of my soul	108.94787942452683
No human being not even my sister is aware of its existence	96.81484566034808
Valentine will you permit me to make a confidant of a friend and reveal to him the love I bear you	68.46043064265591
A friend Maximilian and who is this friend I tremble to give my permission	135.3634175578377
Have you never experienced for anyone that sudden and irresistible sympathy which made you feel as if the object of it had been your old and familiar friend though in reality it was the first time you had ever met Nay further have you never endeavored to recall the time place and circumstances of your former intercourse and failing in this attempt have almost believed that your spirits must have held converse with each other in some state of being anterior to the present and that you are only now occupied in a reminiscence of the past	133.56419456016746
Well that is precisely the feeling which I experienced when I first saw that extraordinary man	168.85659968847884
You have known him for some time then	32.84720012293688
Scarcely longer than eight or ten days	21.901126555739335
And do you call a man your friend whom you have only known for eight or ten days Ah Maximilian I had hoped you set a higher value on the title of friend	82.47085605330051
Your logic is most powerful Valentine but say what you will I can never renounce the sentiment which has instinctively taken possession of my mind	134.15837128110172
I feel as if it were ordained that this man should be associated with all the good which the future may have in store for me and sometimes it really seems as if his eye was able to see what was to come and his hand endowed with the power of directing events according to his own will	93.01373009599915
He must be a prophet then said Valentine smiling	25.502087014724683
Indeed said Maximilian I have often been almost tempted to attribute to him the gift of prophecy at all events he has a wonderful power of foretelling any future good	209.57857221549062
Ah said Valentine in a mournful tone do let me see this man Maximilian he may tell me whether I shall ever be loved sufficiently to make amends for all I have suffered	76.7787371164082
My poor girl you know him already	269.84834010931166
Yes it was he who saved the life of your stepmother and her son	39.76659194741626
Ah cried Valentine he is too much the friend of Madame de Villefort ever to be mine	52.78893425291244
The friend of Madame de Villefort It can not be surely Valentine you are mistaken	73.39384690204523
No indeed I am not for I assure you his power over our household is almost unlimited	271.71394456665183
Courted by my stepmother who regards him as the epitome of human wisdom admired by my father who says he has never before heard such sublime ideas so eloquently expressed idolized by Edward who notwithstanding his fear of the counts large black eyes runs to meet him the moment he arrives and opens his hand in which he is sure to find some delightful presentM	206.2286581131495
de Monte Cristo appears to exert a mysterious and almost uncontrollable influence over all the members of our family	151.65568560959883
If such be the case my dear Valentine you must yourself have felt or at all events will soon feel the effects of his presence	76.90145589485925
He meets Albert de Morcerf in Italyit is to rescue him from the hands of the banditti he introduces himself to Madame Danglarsit is that he may give her a royal present your stepmother and her son pass before his doorit is that his Nubian may save them from destruction	184.44936556329918
This man evidently possesses the power of influencing events both as regards men and things	328.7975857042505
I never saw more simple tastes united to greater magnificence	3306.0921702112646
His smile is so sweet when he addresses me that I forget it ever can be bitter to others	231.39683805005808
Ah Valentine tell me if he ever looked on you with one of those sweet smiles if so depend on it you will be happy	63.27564293226674
Me said the young girl he never even glances at me on the contrary if I accidentally cross his path he appears rather to avoid me	210.1308989746812
Ah he is not generous neither does he possess that supernatural penetration which you attribute to him for if he did he would have perceived that I was unhappy and if he had been generous seeing me sad and solitary he would have used his influence to my advantage and since as you say he resembles the sun he would have warmed my heart with one of his lifegiving rays	123.17621611303464
You say he loves you Maximilian how do you know that he does All would pay deference to an officer like you with a fierce moustache and a long sabre but they think they may crush a poor weeping girl with impunity	147.939520215445
Ah Valentine I assure you you are mistaken	45.33253942259207
If it were otherwiseif he treated me diplomaticallythat is to say like a man who wishes by some means or other to obtain a footing in the house so that he may ultimately gain the power of dictating to its occupantshe would if it had been but once have honored me with the smile which you extol so loudly but no he saw that I was unhappy he understood that I could be of no use to him and therefore paid no attention to me whatever	101.85815520619082
Who knows but that in order to please Madame de Villefort and my father he may not persecute me by every means in his power It is not just that he should despise me so without any reason	75.39103026387689
Ah forgive me said Valentine perceiving the effect which her words were producing on Maximilian I have done wrong for I have given utterance to thoughts concerning that man which I did not even know existed in my heart	114.71623747050812
I do not deny the influence of which you speak or that I have not myself experienced it but with me it has been productive of evil rather than good	102.27097876872817
Well Valentine said Morrel with a sigh we will not discuss the matter further	82.78741832905975
I will not make a confidant of him	87.09342309958548
Alas said Valentine I see that I have given you pain	38.23280603626351
I can only say how sincerely I ask pardon for having grieved you	229.81266389881256
But indeed I am not prejudiced beyond the power of conviction	362.3316654446551
Tell me what this Count of Monte Cristo has done for you	8.581432876742223
I own that your question embarrasses me Valentine for I can not say that the count has rendered me any ostensible service	92.17495764748443
Still as I have already told you I have an instinctive affection for him the source of which I can not explain to you	52.30265688883642
Has the sun done anything for me No he warms me with his rays and it is by his light that I see younothing more	166.39206252483558
Has such and such a perfume done anything for me No its odor charms one of my sensesthat is all I can say when I am asked why I praise it	208.15687319878884
My friendship for him is as strange and unaccountable as his for me	233.91914363041386
A secret voice seems to whisper to me that there must be something more than chance in this unexpected reciprocity of friendship	158.83206486532413
In his most simple actions as well as in his most secret thoughts I find a relation to my own	78.36848069441771
You will perhaps smile at me when I tell you that ever since I have known this man I have involuntarily entertained the idea that all the good fortune which has befallen me originated from him	69.2421542161494
However I have managed to live thirty years without this protection you will say but I will endeavor a little to illustrate my meaning	150.14034707788727
He invited me to dine with him on Saturday which was a very natural thing for him to do	46.18792370928164
Well what have I learned since That your mother and M	355.3253615655307
de Villefort are both coming to this dinner	128.09163300091276
I shall meet them there and who knows what future advantages may result from the interview This may appear to you to be no unusual combination of circumstances nevertheless I perceive some hidden plot in the arrangementsomething in fact more than is apparent on a casual view of the subject	285.39972520366734
I believe that this singular man who appears to fathom the motives of everyone has purposely arranged for me to meet M	113.17458227045498
and Madame de Villefort and sometimes I confess I have gone so far as to try to read in his eyes whether he was in possession of the secret of our love	42.46813926630948
My good friend said Valentine I should take you for a visionary and should tremble for your reason if I were always to hear you talk in a strain similar to this	95.71683665846243
Is it possible that you can see anything more than the merest chance in this meeting Pray reflect a little	170.03807811087876
My father who never goes out has several times been on the point of refusing this invitation Madame de Villefort on the contrary is burning with the desire of seeing this extraordinary nabob in his own house therefore she has with great difficulty prevailed on my father to accompany her	94.36688063088471
No no it is as I have said Maximilianthere is no one in the world of whom I can ask help but yourself and my grandfather who is little better than a corpseno support to cling to but my mother in heaven	90.70120290743918
I see that you are right logically speaking said Maximilian but the gentle voice which usually has such power over me fails to convince me today	153.61980097702767
I feel the same as regards yourself	462.0613170791843
said Valentine and I own that if you have no stronger proof to give me	62.99904087489112
I have another replied Maximilian but I fear you will deem it even more absurd than the first	79.2867755236201
So much the worse said Valentine smiling	56.37731278835872
It is nevertheless conclusive to my mind	54.16043987560014
My ten years of service have also confirmed my ideas on the subject of sudden inspirations for I have several times owed my life to a mysterious impulse which directed me to move at once either to the right or to the left in order to escape the ball which killed the comrade fighting by my side while it left me unharmed	143.73049166754038
Dear Maximilian why not attribute your escape to my constant prayers for your safety When you are away I no longer pray for myself but for you	104.50415182118742
Yes since you have known me said Morrel smiling but that can not apply to the time previous to our acquaintance Valentine	66.47400468702992
You are very provoking and will not give me credit for anything but let me hear this second proof which you yourself own to be absurd	86.62006251024553
Well look through this opening and you will see the beautiful new horse which I rode here	104.15532990048843
Ah what a beautiful creature cried Valentine why did you not bring him close to the gate so that I could talk to him and pat him	49.31554406294806
He is as you see a very valuable animal said Maximilian	219.19288668591423
You know that my means are limited and that I am what would be designated a man of moderate pretensions	132.66050499107814
Well I went to a horse dealers where I saw this magnificent horse which I have named Mdah	250.39933511922408
I asked the price they told me it was 4500 francs	47.26657793096003
I was therefore obliged to give it up as you may imagine but I own I went away with rather a heavy heart for the horse had looked at me affectionately had rubbed his head against me and when I mounted him had pranced in the most delightful way imaginable so that I was altogether fascinated with him	157.72635214579847
The same evening some friends of mine visited meM	2013.8089309713084
Debray and five or six other choice spirits whom you do not know even by name	262.59976025350466
They proposed a game of bouillotte	57210.6000820286
I never play for I am not rich enough to afford to lose or sufficiently poor to desire to gain	105.76976018099985
But I was at my own house you understand so there was nothing to be done but to send for the cards which I did	61.48548708626318
Just as they were sitting down to table M	59.91739445722181
He took his seat amongst them they played and I won	205.6087437128473
I am almost ashamed to say that my gains amounted to 5000 francs	194.92753085663784
I could not defer my pleasure so I took a cabriolet and drove to the horse dealers	139.1499889133573
Feverish and excited I rang at the door	7.520342651503776
The person who opened it must have taken me for a madman for I rushed at once to the stable	56.05379076188413
Mdah was standing at the rack eating his hay	5872.4539112611255
I immediately put on the saddle and bridle to which operation he lent himself with the best grace possible then putting the 4500 francs into the hands of the astonished dealer I proceeded to fulfil my intention of passing the night in riding in the Champslyses	141.75134693490673
As I rode by the counts house I perceived a light in one of the windows and fancied I saw the shadow of his figure moving behind the curtain	72.91338963772215
Now Valentine I firmly believe that he knew of my wish to possess this horse and that he lost expressly to give me the means of procuring him	84.18589346069702
My dear Maximilian you are really too fanciful you will not love even me long	159.8817753461958
A man who accustoms himself to live in such a world of poetry and imagination must find far too little excitement in a common everyday sort of attachment such as ours	201.69963991564472
Ah Valentine said Maximilian give me but one finger through this opening in the grating one finger the littlest finger of all that I may have the happiness of kissing it	127.1756565119836
Maximilian we said we would be to each other as two voices two shadows	151.545067635268
Shall you be happy if I do what you wish	13.875829237590658
Valentine mounted on a bench and passed not only her finger but her whole hand through the opening	126.1066733145718
Maximilian uttered a cry of delight and springing forwards seized the hand extended towards him and imprinted on it a fervent and impassioned kiss	323.2290427048163
The little hand was then immediately withdrawn and the young man saw Valentine hurrying towards the house as though she were almost terrified at her own sensations	102.8311876643272
We will now relate what was passing in the house of the kings attorney after the departure of Madame Danglars and her daughter and during the time of the conversation between Maximilian and Valentine which we have just detailed	25.72426477439225
de Villefort entered his fathers room followed by Madame de Villefort	9.131996953668214
Both of the visitors after saluting the old man and speaking to Barrois a faithful servant who had been twentyfive years in his service took their places on either side of the paralytic	75.56120765218593
Noirtier was sitting in an armchair which moved upon casters in which he was wheeled into the room in the morning and in the same way drawn out again at night	63.95127494032928
He was placed before a large glass which reflected the whole apartment and so without any attempt to move which would have been impossible he could see all who entered the room and everything which was going on around him	87.65669399139657
Noirtier although almost as immovable as a corpse looked at the newcomers with a quick and intelligent expression perceiving at once by their ceremonious courtesy that they were come on business of an unexpected and official character	133.23068926660696
Sight and hearing were the only senses remaining and they like two solitary sparks remained to animate the miserable body which seemed fit for nothing but the grave it was only however by means of one of these senses that he could reveal the thoughts and feelings that still occupied his mind and the look by which he gave expression to his inner life was like the distant gleam of a candle which a traveller sees by night across some desert place and knows that a living being dwells beyond the silence and obscurity	225.3620805305537
Noirtiers hair was long and white and flowed over his shoulders while in his eyes shaded by thick black lashes was concentrated as it often happens with an organ which is used to the exclusion of the others all the activity address force and intelligence which were formerly diffused over his whole body and so although the movement of the arm the sound of the voice and the agility of the body were wanting the speaking eye sufficed for all	147.24939556968891
He commanded with it it was the medium through which his thanks were conveyed	153.9052475219508
In short his whole appearance produced on the mind the impression of a corpse with living eyes and nothing could be more startling than to observe the expression of anger or joy suddenly lighting up these organs while the rest of the rigid and marblelike features were utterly deprived of the power of participation	143.14531988448468
Three persons only could understand this language of the poor paralytic these were Villefort Valentine and the old servant of whom we have already spoken	91.74719651742785
But as Villefort saw his father but seldom and then only when absolutely obliged and as he never took any pains to please or gratify him when he was there all the old mans happiness was centred in his granddaughter	146.02906569218035
Valentine by means of her love her patience and her devotion had learned to read in Noirtiers look all the varied feelings which were passing in his mind	91.22374278978876
To this dumb language which was so unintelligible to others she answered by throwing her whole soul into the expression of her countenance and in this manner were the conversations sustained between the blooming girl and the helpless invalid whose body could scarcely be called a living one but who nevertheless possessed a fund of knowledge and penetration united with a will as powerful as ever although clogged by a body rendered utterly incapable of obeying its impulses	238.56367296688168
Valentine had solved the problem and was able easily to understand his thoughts and to convey her own in return and through her untiring and devoted assiduity it was seldom that in the ordinary transactions of everyday life she failed to anticipate the wishes of the living thinking mind or the wants of the almost inanimate body	237.817937557608
As to the servant he had as we have said been with his master for fiveandtwenty years therefore he knew all his habits and it was seldom that Noirtier found it necessary to ask for anything so prompt was he in administering to all the necessities of the invalid	142.0752526458553
Villefort did not need the help of either Valentine or the domestic in order to carry on with his father the strange conversation which he was about to begin	79.76040257123168
As we have said he perfectly understood the old mans vocabulary and if he did not use it more often it was only indifference and ennui which prevented him from so doing	117.46291889298675
He therefore allowed Valentine to go into the garden sent away Barrois and after having seated himself at his fathers right hand while Madame de Villefort placed herself on the left he addressed him thus	66.65254612167843
I trust you will not be displeased sir that Valentine has not come with us or that I dismissed Barrois for our conference will be one which could not with propriety be carried on in the presence of either	132.05550679519132
Madame de Villefort and I have a communication to make to you	75.32324900900886
Noirtiers face remained perfectly passive during this long preamble while on the contrary Villeforts eye was endeavoring to penetrate into the inmost recesses of the old mans heart	94.19804900552109
This communication continued the procureur in that cold and decisive tone which seemed at once to preclude all discussion will we are sure meet with your approbation	184.35013934536914
The eye of the invalid still retained that vacancy of expression which prevented his son from obtaining any knowledge of the feelings which were passing in his mind he listened nothing more	122.5618173823738
Sir resumed Villefort we are thinking of marrying Valentine	211.59803340010495
Had the old mans face been moulded in wax it could not have shown less emotion at this news than was now to be traced there	169.05433736959824
The marriage will take place in less than three months said Villefort	41.08041912249565
Noirtiers eye still retained its inanimate expression	123.80353362107867
Madame de Villefort now took her part in the conversation and added	73.46442140308729
We thought this news would possess an interest for you sir who have always entertained a great affection for Valentine it therefore only now remains for us to tell you the name of the young man for whom she is destined	60.99122157449691
It is one of the most desirable connections which could possibly be formed he possesses fortune a high rank in society and every personal qualification likely to render Valentine supremely happyhis name moreover can not be wholly unknown to you	416.04424510614484
While his wife was speaking Villefort had narrowly watched the old mans countenance	126.34026114799414
When Madame de Villefort pronounced the name of Franz the pupil of M	62.74666364040325
Noirtiers eye began to dilate and his eyelids trembled with the same movement that may be perceived on the lips of an individual about to speak and he darted a lightning glance at Madame de Villefort and his son	50.55076414470143
The procureur who knew the political hatred which had formerly existed between M	281.00686425380246
Noirtier and the elder dpinay well understood the agitation and anger which the announcement had produced but feigning not to perceive either he immediately resumed the narrative begun by his wife	252.09611166117162
Sir said he you are aware that Valentine is about to enter her nineteenth year which renders it important that she should lose no time in forming a suitable alliance	160.70517514386708
Nevertheless you have not been forgotten in our plans and we have fully ascertained beforehand that Valentines future husband will consent not to live in this house for that might not be pleasant for the young people but that you should live with them so that you and Valentine who are so attached to each other would not be separated and you would be able to pursue exactly the same course of life which you have hitherto done and thus instead of losing you will be a gainer by the change as it will secure to you two children instead of one to watch over and comfort you	89.7243050002278
Noirtiers look was furious it was very evident that something desperate was passing in the old mans mind for a cry of anger and grief rose in his throat and not being able to find vent in utterance appeared almost to choke him for his face and lips turned quite purple with the struggle	76.24503555377636
Villefort quietly opened a window saying It is very warm and the heat affects M	272.6826262054388
He then returned to his place but did not sit down	40.12612540051755
This marriage added Madame de Villefort is quite agreeable to the wishes of M	29.16282018393335
dpinay and his family besides he had no relations nearer than an uncle and aunt his mother having died at his birth and his father having been assassinated in 1815 that is to say when he was but two years old it naturally followed that the child was permitted to choose his own pursuits and he has therefore seldom acknowledged any other authority but that of his own will	116.12539228567364
That assassination was a mysterious affair said Villefort and the perpetrators have hitherto escaped detection although suspicion has fallen on the head of more than one person	218.79583570140002
Noirtier made such an effort that his lips expanded into a smile	200.09806811440367
Now continued Villefort those to whom the guilt really belongs by whom the crime was committed on whose heads the justice of man may probably descend here and the certain judgment of God hereafter would rejoice in the opportunity thus afforded of bestowing such a peaceoffering as Valentine on the son of him whose life they so ruthlessly destroyed	336.54065269068184
Noirtier had succeeded in mastering his emotion more than could have been deemed possible with such an enfeebled and shattered frame	238.78746533316865
Yes I understand was the reply contained in his look and this look expressed a feeling of strong indignation mixed with profound contempt	203.8059053765606
Villefort fully understood his fathers meaning and answered by a slight shrug of his shoulders	112.81248031233285
He then motioned to his wife to take leave	55.491212913302725
Now sir said Madame de Villefort I must bid you farewell	48.54760583397483
Would you like me to send Edward to you for a short time	48.03479788449204
It had been agreed that the old man should express his approbation by closing his eyes his refusal by winking them several times and if he had some desire or feeling to express he raised them to heaven	131.1372105385532
If he wanted Valentine he closed his right eye only and if Barrois the left	316.9446399843743
At Madame de Villeforts proposition he instantly winked his eyes	220.19042090700185
Provoked by a complete refusal she bit her lip and said Then shall I send Valentine to you The old man closed his eyes eagerly thereby intimating that such was his wish	222.73314183737972
and Madame de Villefort bowed and left the room giving orders that Valentine should be summoned to her grandfathers presence and feeling sure that she would have much to do to restore calmness to the perturbed spirit of the invalid	82.34464045893326
Valentine with a color still heightened by emotion entered the room just after her parents had quitted it	196.71591065842094
One look was sufficient to tell her that her grandfather was suffering and that there was much on his mind which he was wishing to communicate to her	55.580214021890654
Dear grandpapa cried she what has happened They have vexed you and you are angry	129.93870081839387
The paralytic closed his eyes in token of assent	26.175501434504085
Who has displeased you Is it my father	8.126051784185156
Me The former sign was repeated	148.33879961359273
Are you displeased with me cried Valentine in astonishment	119.84866823195826
And what have I done dear grandpapa that you should be angry with me cried Valentine	53.554547268640285
There was no answer and she continued	135.8989354209532
I have not seen you all day	223.74706999044275
Has anyone been speaking to you against me	33.90715349317764
Yes said the old mans look with eagerness	659.9573301923285
and Madame de Villefort have just left this room have they not	73.77756455368421
And it was they who told you something which made you angry What was it then May I go and ask them that I may have the opportunity of making my peace with you	92.75420208989303
What can they have said and she again tried to think what it could be	59.333656852652204
Ah I know said she lowering her voice and going close to the old man	61.668586447175095
They have been speaking of my marriagehave they not	901.5793135974486
I understand you are displeased at the silence I have preserved on the subject	43.28882848970376
The reason of it was that they had insisted on my keeping the matter a secret and begged me not to tell you anything of it	88.89763198142363
They did not even acquaint me with their intentions and I only discovered them by chance that is why I have been so reserved with you dear grandpapa	61.22089164561489
But there was no look calculated to reassure her all it seemed to say was It is not only your reserve which afflicts me	177.63126940754557
What is it then asked the young girl	6.836858027912226
Perhaps you think I shall abandon you dear grandpapa and that I shall forget you when I am married	65.92662737067944
They told you then that M	77.86508174114304
dpinay consented to our all living together	647.5747148430078
Then why are you still vexed and grieved The old mans eyes beamed with an expression of gentle affection	89.58962412798193
Yes I understand said Valentine it is because you love me	20.327009575734532
And you are afraid I shall be unhappy	34.29229360561994
Franz The eyes repeated several times No no no	146.79494474828442
Then you are vexed with the engagement	128.33124010925255
Well listen said Valentine throwing herself on her knees and putting her arm round her grandfathers neck I am vexed too for I do not love M	44.06988284920659
An expression of intense joy illumined the old mans eyes	5.719222390630232
When I wished to retire into a convent you remember how angry you were with me A tear trembled in the eye of the invalid	114.63508326126798
Well continued Valentine the reason of my proposing it was that I might escape this hateful marriage which drives me to despair	116.4479590030923
Noirtiers breathing came thick and short	2272.2041065141284
Then the idea of this marriage really grieves you too Ah if you could but help meif we could both together defeat their plan But you are unable to oppose themyou whose mind is so quick and whose will is so firm are nevertheless as weak and unequal to the contest as I am myself	277.53161900363114
Alas you who would have been such a powerful protector to me in the days of your health and strength can now only sympathize in my joys and sorrows without being able to take any active part in them	125.5566779829744
However this is much and calls for gratitude and Heaven has not taken away all my blessings when it leaves me your sympathy and kindness	269.27595913271466
At these words there appeared in Noirtiers eye an expression of such deep meaning that the young girl thought she could read these words there You are mistaken I can still do much for you	51.925148733035584
Do you think you can help me dear grandpapa said Valentine	33.93805537871059
Noirtier raised his eyes it was the sign agreed on between him and Valentine when he wanted anything	100.65372777818773
What is it you want dear grandpapa said Valentine and she endeavored to recall to mind all the things which he would be likely to need and as the ideas presented themselves to her mind she repeated them aloud thenfinding that all her efforts elicited nothing but a constant Noshe said Come since this plan does not answer I will have recourse to another	126.69436031330942
She then recited all the letters of the alphabet from A down to N	621.8631990583777
When she arrived at that letter the paralytic made her understand that she had spoken the initial letter of the thing he wanted	143.9645526081642
Ah said Valentine the thing you desire begins with the letter N it is with N that we have to do then	175.40689793370723
Well let me see what can you want that begins with N NaNeNiNo	496.6441440306666
Yes yes yes said the old mans eye	33.690052499823295
Valentine fetched a dictionary which she placed on a desk before Noirtier she opened it and seeing that the old mans eye was thoroughly fixed on its pages she ran her finger quickly up and down the columns	63.6224609737416
During the six years which had passed since Noirtier first fell into this sad state Valentines powers of invention had been too often put to the test not to render her expert in devising expedients for gaining a knowledge of his wishes and the constant practice had so perfected her in the art that she guessed the old mans meaning as quickly as if he himself had been able to seek for what he wanted	144.22423063457293
At the word Notary Noirtier made a sign to her to stop	21.48478564432522
Notary said she do you want a notary dear grandpapa The old man again signified that it was a notary he desired	100.91679790593584
You would wish a notary to be sent for then said Valentine	45.13655502602034
Shall my father be informed of your wish	105.83427774786817
Do you wish the notary to be sent for immediately	86.22493581923943
Then they shall go for him directly dear grandpapa	112.594840234767
Valentine rang the bell and ordered the servant to tell Monsieur or Madame de Villefort that they were requested to come to M	75.90587057789453
Are you satisfied now inquired Valentine	41.38168542008268
I am sure you are it is not very difficult to discover that	44.276641743896036
And the young girl smiled on her grandfather as if he had been a child	18.510424408836716
de Villefort entered followed by Barrois	598.5957904750846
What do you want me for sir demanded he of the paralytic	375.91097682640805
Sir said Valentine my grandfather wishes for a notary	231.58613827482483
At this strange and unexpected demand M	1844.8680923077586
de Villefort and his father exchanged looks	1001.0291629016187
Yes motioned the latter with a firmness which seemed to declare that with the help of Valentine and his old servant who both knew what his wishes were he was quite prepared to maintain the contest	80.82093130653298
Do you wish for a notary asked Villefort	139.15270245545682
What do you want with a notary again repeated Villefort	416.5503574156557
The invalids eye remained fixed by which expression he intended to intimate that his resolution was unalterable	147.48154911901145
Is it to do us some ill turn Do you think it is worth while said Villefort	74.72698877756095
Still said Barrois with the freedom and fidelity of an old servant if M	149.27404962138067
Noirtier asks for a notary I suppose he really wishes for a notary therefore I shall go at once and fetch one	87.01076249380826
Barrois acknowledged no master but Noirtier and never allowed his desires in any way to be contradicted	148.74226568475962
Yes I do want a notary motioned the old man shutting his eyes with a look of defiance which seemed to say and I should like to see the person who dares to refuse my request	64.5358607000071
You shall have a notary as you absolutely wish for one sir said Villefort but I shall explain to him your state of health and make excuses for you for the scene can not fail of being a most ridiculous one	98.4963088381222
Never mind that said Barrois I shall go and fetch a notary nevertheless	117.69084755449008
And the old servant departed triumphantly on his mission	324.79481609499027
As soon as Barrois had left the room Noirtier looked at Valentine with a malicious expression that said many things	39.649044750528965
The young girl perfectly understood the look and so did Villefort for his countenance became clouded and he knitted his eyebrows angrily	295.4489976074439
He took a seat and quietly awaited the arrival of the notary	54.10330136856758
Noirtier saw him seat himself with an appearance of perfect indifference at the same time giving a side look at Valentine which made her understand that she also was to remain in the room	55.6117020747744
Threequarters of an hour after Barrois returned bringing the notary with him	128.8875227664011
Sir said Villefort after the first salutations were over you were sent for by M	136.99737137310532
All his limbs have become completely paralysed he has lost his voice also and we ourselves find much trouble in endeavoring to catch some fragments of his meaning	271.6093406949731
Noirtier cast an appealing look on Valentine which look was at once so earnest and imperative that she answered immediately	189.93827036611893
Sir said she I perfectly understand my grandfathers meaning at all times	279.9956321854963
That is quite true said Barrois and that is what I told the gentleman as we walked along	78.7097848692178
Permit me said the notary turning first to Villefort and then to Valentinepermit me to state that the case in question is just one of those in which a public officer like myself can not proceed to act without thereby incurring a dangerous responsibility	198.09579159384046
The first thing necessary to render an act valid is that the notary should be thoroughly convinced that he has faithfully interpreted the will and wishes of the person dictating the act	274.40459183894774
Now I can not be sure of the approbation or disapprobation of a client who can not speak and as the object of his desire or his repugnance can not be clearly proved to me on account of his want of speech my services here would be quite useless and can not be legally exercised	112.51430896999724
The notary then prepared to retire	267.085608142143
An imperceptible smile of triumph was expressed on the lips of the procureur	23.364109477567343
Noirtier looked at Valentine with an expression so full of grief that she arrested the departure of the notary	43.404257599899395
Sir said she the language which I speak with my grandfather may be easily learnt and I can teach you in a few minutes to understand it almost as well as I can myself	66.20192829581505
Will you tell me what you require in order to set your conscience quite at ease on the subject	95.83852388079892
In order to render an act valid I must be certain of the approbation or disapprobation of my client	236.65614788288315
Illness of body would not affect the validity of the deed but sanity of mind is absolutely requisite	294.34677782629507
Well sir by the help of two signs with which I will acquaint you presently you may ascertain with perfect certainty that my grandfather is still in the full possession of all his mental faculties	128.7410201113367
Noirtier being deprived of voice and motion is accustomed to convey his meaning by closing his eyes when he wishes to signify yes and to wink when he means no	145.87855254000377
You now know quite enough to enable you to converse with M	35.58845049085907
Noirtier gave Valentine such a look of tenderness and gratitude that it was comprehended even by the notary himself	98.18946277541912
You have heard and understood what your granddaughter has been saying sir have you asked the notary	89.12763017181824
And you approve of what she saidthat is to say you declare that the signs which she mentioned are really those by means of which you are accustomed to convey your thoughts	151.76535500390779
It was you who sent for me	8.038044552123669
And you do not wish me to go away without fulfilling your original intentions The old man winked violently	146.021816985563
Well sir said the young girl do you understand now and is your conscience perfectly at rest on the subject	74.76675068747397
But before the notary could answer Villefort had drawn him aside	120.23316786324568
Sir said he do you suppose for a moment that a man can sustain a physical shock such as M	116.18843263593918
Noirtier has received without any detriment to his mental faculties	825.474290267699
It is not exactly that sir said the notary which makes me uneasy but the difficulty will be in wording his thoughts and intentions so as to be able to get his answers	88.54895187892136
You must see that to be an utter impossibility said Villefort	219.1765474423026
Valentine and the old man heard this conversation and Noirtier fixed his eye so earnestly on Valentine that she felt bound to answer to the look	66.18013467608083
Sir said she that need not make you uneasy however difficult it may at first sight appear to be	204.45599464046634
I can discover and explain to you my grandfathers thoughts so as to put an end to all your doubts and fears on the subject	83.49528115487253
I have now been six years with M	27.547914388976643
Noirtier and let him tell you if ever once during that time he has entertained a thought which he was unable to make me understand	70.48885838289846
Let us try what we can do then said the notary	33.914443436037736
You accept this young lady as your interpreter M	182.4280864623347
Well sir what do you require of me and what document is it that you wish to be drawn up	62.755855711648685
Valentine named all the letters of the alphabet until she came to W	127.37824474894211
At this letter the eloquent eye of Noirtier gave her notice that she was to stop	38.08878007049837
It is very evident that it is the letter W which M	79.44377780322901
Wait said Valentine and turning to her grandfather she repeated WaWeWi The old man stopped her at the last syllable	141.30083073647813
Valentine then took the dictionary and the notary watched her while she turned over the pages	95.30406101593802
She passed her finger slowly down the columns and when she came to the word Will M	78.00521947386684
Will said the notary it is very evident that M	34.61988587278809
Noirtier is desirous of making his will	93.1109377492449
Yes yes yes motioned the invalid	497.12301430149637
Really sir you must allow that this is most extraordinary said the astonished notary turning to M	91.00848291691639
Yes said the procureur and I think the will promises to be yet more extraordinary for I can not see how it is to be drawn up without the intervention of Valentine and she may perhaps be considered as too much interested in its contents to allow of her being a suitable interpreter of the obscure and illdefined wishes of her grandfather	98.86247353461783
No no no replied the eye of the paralytic	81.36021404538319
What said Villefort do you mean to say that Valentine is not interested in your will	34.730218316781816
Sir said the notary whose interest had been greatly excited and who had resolved on publishing far and wide the account of this extraordinary and picturesque scene what appeared so impossible to me an hour ago has now become quite easy and practicable and this may be a perfectly valid will provided it be read in the presence of seven witnesses approved by the testator and sealed by the notary in the presence of the witnesses	145.15911864907986
As to the time it will not require very much more than the generality of wills	109.6177565557259
There are certain forms necessary to be gone through and which are always the same	49.225567806031385
As to the details the greater part will be furnished afterwards by the state in which we find the affairs of the testator and by yourself who having had the management of them can doubtless give full information on the subject	155.56944631589002
But besides all this in order that the instrument may not be contested I am anxious to give it the greatest possible authenticity therefore one of my colleagues will help me and contrary to custom will assist in the dictation of the testament	202.27860864986863
Are you satisfied sir continued the notary addressing the old man	25.831862856712178
Yes looked the invalid his eye beaming with delight at the ready interpretation of his meaning	126.7857449342872
What is he going to do thought Villefort whose position demanded much reserve but who was longing to know what his fathers intentions were	265.44630825393926
He left the room to give orders for another notary to be sent but Barrois who had heard all that passed had guessed his masters wishes and had already gone to fetch one	110.87121162852273
The procureur then told his wife to come up	39.186373049717105
In the course of a quarter of an hour everyone had assembled in the chamber of the paralytic the second notary had also arrived	57.48648375446727
A few words sufficed for a mutual understanding between the two officers of the law	84.89807289720282
They read to Noirtier the formal copy of a will in order to give him an idea of the terms in which such documents are generally couched then in order to test the capacity of the testator the first notary said turning towards him	143.98386648190836
When an individual makes his will it is generally in favor or in prejudice of some person	191.15943460135168
Have you an exact idea of the amount of your fortune	22.72466317476478
I will name to you several sums which will increase by gradation you will stop me when I reach the one representing the amount of your own possessions	179.1395791347628
There was a kind of solemnity in this interrogation	696.3897326780882
Never had the struggle between mind and matter been more apparent than now and if it was not a sublime it was at least a curious spectacle	139.7781176575493
They had formed a circle round the invalid the second notary was sitting at a table prepared for writing and his colleague was standing before the testator in the act of interrogating him on the subject to which we have alluded	100.61178965887622
Your fortune exceeds 300000 francs does it not asked he	46.583471729322554
Noirtier made a sign that it did	108.79177351020363
Do you possess 400000 francs inquired the notary	29.22502584135677
Noirtier stopped him at the lastnamed sum	7803.603020723307
You are then in possession of 900000 francs asked the notary	38.72728930687799
The stock is in your own hands	45.50471828073255
Noirtier cast on Barrois showed that there was something wanting which he knew where to find	129.2205083420328
The old servant left the room and presently returned bringing with him a small casket	177.93460060733025
Do you permit us to open this casket asked the notary	121.91564951243863
They opened it and found 900000 francs in bank scrip	1387.804038119917
The first notary handed over each note as he examined it to his colleague	91.67966383849134
The total amount was found to be as M	44.489155756807115
It is all as he has said it is very evident that the mind still retains its full force and vigor	110.90277283306501
Then turning towards the paralytic he said You possess then 900000 francs of capital which according to the manner in which you have invested it ought to bring in an income of about 40000 livres	118.91096929165728
To whom do you desire to leave this fortune	56.13167362095844
Oh said Madame de Villefort there is not much doubt on that subject	91.34937988005237
Noirtier tenderly loves his granddaughter Mademoiselle de Villefort it is she who has nursed and tended him for six years and has by her devoted attention fully secured the affection I had almost said the gratitude of her grandfather and it is but just that she should reap the fruit of her devotion	129.74506199510583
The eye of Noirtier clearly showed by its expression that he was not deceived by the false assent given by Madame de Villeforts words and manner to the motives which she supposed him to entertain	76.75929950894214
Is it then to Mademoiselle Valentine de Villefort that you leave these 900000 francs demanded the notary thinking he had only to insert this clause but waiting first for the assent of Noirtier which it was necessary should be given before all the witnesses of this singular scene	138.24273603614319
Valentine when her name was made the subject of discussion had stepped back to escape unpleasant observation her eyes were cast down and she was crying	205.4872806094774
The old man looked at her for an instant with an expression of the deepest tenderness then turning towards the notary he significantly winked his eye in token of dissent	68.96470661028731
What said the notary do you not intend making Mademoiselle Valentine de Villefort your residuary legatee	375.6215542473511
You are not making any mistake are you said the notary you really mean to declare that such is not your intention	107.54519710968508
Valentine raised her head struck dumb with astonishment	202.0255939971883
It was not so much the conviction that she was disinherited that caused her grief but her total inability to account for the feelings which had provoked her grandfather to such an act	159.07256704518943
But Noirtier looked at her with so much affectionate tenderness that she exclaimed	67.55131159384831
Oh grandpapa I see now that it is only your fortune of which you deprive me you still leave me the love which I have always enjoyed	77.01395818551161
Ah yes most assuredly said the eyes of the paralytic for he closed them with an expression which Valentine could not mistake	54.360076472526636
Thank you thank you murmured she	163.39403943084375
The old mans declaration that Valentine was not the destined inheritor of his fortune had excited the hopes of Madame de Villefort she gradually approached the invalid and said	70.7398087078188
Noirtier you intend leaving your fortune to your grandson Edward de Villefort	98.9034703304728
The winking of the eyes which answered this speech was most decided and terrible and expressed a feeling almost amounting to hatred	263.5711949211482
No said the notary then perhaps it is to your son M	76.87215150550097
The two notaries looked at each other in mute astonishment and inquiry as to what were the real intentions of the testator	122.79331364459466
Villefort and his wife both grew red one from shame the other from anger	421.5023313397831
What have we all done then dear grandpapa said Valentine you no longer seem to love any of us	52.22953075624104
The old mans eyes passed rapidly from Villefort and his wife and rested on Valentine with a look of unutterable fondness	82.13221867757208
Well said she if you love me grandpapa try and bring that love to bear upon your actions at this present moment	185.56180603350478
You know me well enough to be quite sure that I have never thought of your fortune besides they say I am already rich in right of my mothertoo rich even	84.10031605872165
Noirtier fixed his intelligent eyes on Valentines hand	77.26341056902844
Oh gentlemen you see it is all useless and that my fathers mind is really impaired said Villefort	141.3093730778774
Ah cried Valentine suddenly I understand	44.44419138054751
It is my marriage you mean is it not dear grandpapa	49.38431537016319
Yes yes yes signed the paralytic casting on Valentine a look of joyful gratitude for having guessed his meaning	209.8077142419519
You are angry with us all on account of this marriage are you not	45.032946610475584
Really this is too absurd said Villefort	10.938651357582872
Excuse me sir replied the notary on the contrary the meaning of M	45.97962990112331
Noirtier is quite evident to me and I can quite easily connect the train of ideas passing in his mind	123.53382443836641
You do not wish me to marry M	19.079994662244605
I do not wish it said the eye of her grandfather	38.98031096574959
And you disinherit your granddaughter continued the notary because she has contracted an engagement contrary to your wishes	138.65938559362456
So that but for this marriage she would have been your heir	50.321527517541035
The two notaries were holding a consultation as to the best means of proceeding with the affair	125.87809530467197
Valentine was looking at her grandfather with a smile of intense gratitude and Villefort was biting his lips with vexation while Madame de Villefort could not succeed in repressing an inward feeling of joy which in spite of herself appeared in her whole countenance	68.51884058579039
But said Villefort who was the first to break the silence I consider that I am the best judge of the propriety of the marriage in question	55.808765518228796
I am the only person possessing the right to dispose of my daughters hand	222.3264573351872
It is my wish that she should marry M	91.56059859788151
Franz dpinayand she shall marry him	16.05294014288232
Valentine sank weeping into a chair	2.0363356802340657
Sir said the notary how do you intend disposing of your fortune in case Mademoiselle de Villefort still determines on marrying M	148.87071635541213
Franz The old man gave no answer	38.528323724246825
You will of course dispose of it in some way or other	34.197409151059574
In favor of some member of your family	15.834913284379855
Do you intend devoting it to charitable purposes then pursued the notary	796.1836186126899
But said the notary you are aware that the law does not allow a son to be entirely deprived of his patrimony	67.85149003675866
You only intend then to dispose of that part of your fortune which the law allows you to subtract from the inheritance of your son Noirtier made no answer	122.130529160388
Do you still wish to dispose of all	140.38982813050768
But they will contest the will after your death	218.89683116335908
My father knows me replied Villefort he is quite sure that his wishes will be held sacred by me besides he understands that in my position I can not plead against the poor	89.83255346765964
The eye of Noirtier beamed with triumph	195.11769927290996
What do you decide on sir asked the notary of Villefort	37.04884861150877
Nothing sir it is a resolution which my father has taken and I know he never alters his mind	108.3612678277585
These 900000 francs will go out of the family in order to enrich some hospital but it is ridiculous thus to yield to the caprices of an old man and I shall therefore act according to my conscience	71.12280393552231
Having said this Villefort quitted the room with his wife leaving his father at liberty to do as he pleased	43.68185176026043
The same day the will was made the witnesses were brought it was approved by the old man sealed in the presence of all and given in charge to M	97.014716955323
and Madame de Villefort found on their return that the Count of Monte Cristo who had come to visit them in their absence had been ushered into the drawingroom and was still awaiting them there	37.98447860299321
Madame de Villefort who had not yet sufficiently recovered from her late emotion to allow of her entertaining visitors so immediately retired to her bedroom while the procureur who could better depend upon himself proceeded at once to the salon	180.018594090761
de Villefort flattered himself that to all outward view he had completely masked the feelings which were passing in his mind he did not know that the cloud was still lowering on his brow so much so that the count whose smile was radiant immediately noticed his sombre and thoughtful air	109.94575911468672
Ma foi said Monte Cristo after the first compliments were over what is the matter with you M	71.73243130867542
de Villefort Have I arrived at the moment when you were drawing up an indictment for a capital crime	96.10630367514646
No count he replied I am the only victim in this case	68.47348064165396
It is I who lose my cause and it is illluck obstinacy and folly which have caused it to be decided against me	130.69850897505088
To what do you refer said Monte Cristo with wellfeigned interest	52.388930102689514
Have you really met with some great misfortune	136.54402858379504
Oh no monsieur said Villefort with a bitter smile it is only a loss of money which I have sustainednothing worth mentioning I assure you	72.57333913487942
True said Monte Cristo the loss of a sum of money becomes almost immaterial with a fortune such as you possess and to one of your philosophic spirit	130.7126893796521
It is not so much the loss of the money that vexes me said Villefort though after all 900000 francs are worth regretting but I am the more annoyed with this fate chance or whatever you please to call the power which has destroyed my hopes and my fortune and may blast the prospects of my child also as it is all occasioned by an old man relapsed into second childhood	125.17506542765882
What do you say said the count 900000 francs It is indeed a sum which might be regretted even by a philosopher	85.65848989976347
And who is the cause of all this annoyance	65.75975670751151
My father as I told you	1.2605080716055959
Noirtier But I thought you told me he had become entirely paralyzed and that all his faculties were completely destroyed	148.44350319444627
Yes his bodily faculties for he can neither move nor speak nevertheless he thinks acts and wills in the manner I have described	289.66592190569713
I left him about five minutes ago and he is now occupied in dictating his will to two notaries	132.13894021655105
But to do this he must have spoken	74.69346754814278
He has done better than thathe has made himself understood	531.9727945691318
How was such a thing possible	654.7274710041359
By the help of his eyes which are still full of life and as you perceive possess the power of inflicting mortal injury	148.34085089787368
My dear said Madame de Villefort who had just entered the room perhaps you exaggerate the evil	72.38032554772718
Goodmorning madame said the count bowing	592.7469220961893
Madame de Villefort acknowledged the salutation with one of her most gracious smiles	107.9394986710229
de Villefort has been telling me demanded Monte Cristo and what incomprehensible misfortune	150.834065054287
Incomprehensible is the word interrupted the procureur shrugging his shoulders	28.9242388011005
It is an old mans caprice	10283.505766983772
And is there no means of making him revoke his decision	183.29506301555227
Yes said Madame de Villefort and it is still entirely in the power of my husband to cause the will which is now in prejudice of Valentine to be altered in her favor	80.88616707021674
The count who perceived that M	160.4555180360429
and Madame de Villefort were beginning to speak in parables appeared to pay no attention to the conversation and feigned to be busily engaged in watching Edward who was mischievously pouring some ink into the birds waterglass	216.11286914583093
My dear said Villefort in answer to his wife you know I have never been accustomed to play the patriarch in my family nor have I ever considered that the fate of a universe was to be decided by my nod	81.96915432576306
Nevertheless it is necessary that my will should be respected in my family and that the folly of an old man and the caprice of a child should not be allowed to overturn a project which I have entertained for so many years	55.30940562175506
The Baron dpinay was my friend as you know and an alliance with his son is the most suitable thing that could possibly be arranged	81.6050753566914
Do you think said Madame de Villefort that Valentine is in league with him She has always been opposed to this marriage and I should not be at all surprised if what we have just seen and heard is nothing but the execution of a plan concerted between them	72.88607940118438
Madame said Villefort believe me a fortune of 900000 francs is not so easily renounced	142.17237938905367
She could nevertheless make up her mind to renounce the world sir since it is only about a year ago that she herself proposed entering a convent	120.15509362814514
Never mind replied Villefort I say that this marriage shall be consummated	44.02433021375958
Notwithstanding your fathers wishes to the contrary said Madame de Villefort selecting a new point of attack	124.99890362836946
Monte Cristo who pretended not to be listening heard however every word that was said	230.24086562332485
Madame replied Villefort I can truly say that I have always entertained a high respect for my father because to the natural feeling of relationship was added the consciousness of his moral superiority	187.53692025053786
The name of father is sacred in two senses he should be reverenced as the author of our being and as a master whom we ought to obey	158.46626865281326
But under the present circumstances I am justified in doubting the wisdom of an old man who because he hated the father vents his anger on the son	109.62429529454214
It would be ridiculous in me to regulate my conduct by such caprices	371.79891987391346
I shall still continue to preserve the same respect toward M	221.26743893565893
Noirtier I will suffer without complaint the pecuniary deprivation to which he has subjected me but I shall remain firm in my determination and the world shall see which party has reason on his side	201.22553031189767
Consequently I shall marry my daughter to the Baron Franz dpinay because I consider it would be a proper and eligible match for her to make and in short because I choose to bestow my daughters hand on whomever I please	170.3558609975452
What said the count the approbation of whose eye Villefort had frequently solicited during this speech	341.8937485617787
What Do you say that M	45.37665079293112
Noirtier disinherits Mademoiselle de Villefort because she is going to marry M	32.171950903082724
Yes sir that is the reason said Villefort shrugging his shoulders	15.7443554311483
The apparent reason at least said Madame de Villefort	13.208312441551957
The real reason madame I can assure you I know my father	19.768495711645556
But I want to know in what way M	122.2893317424352
dpinay can have displeased your father more than any other person	38.25356138249345
Franz dpinay said the count is he not the son of General de Quesnel who was created Baron dpinay by Charles X	127.81025806833384
Well but he is a charming young man according to my ideas	90.10045985638303
He is which makes me believe that it is only an excuse of M	45.64556002462683
Noirtier to prevent his granddaughter marrying old men are always so selfish in their affection said Madame de Villefort	97.40569604911492
But said Monte Cristo do you not know any cause for this hatred	40.29705605824158
Ah ma foi who is to know	43.04161566207122
Perhaps it is some political difference	4618.4821366555025
My father and the Baron dpinay lived in the stormy times of which I only saw the ending said Villefort	125.22227670193038
Was not your father a Bonapartist asked Monte Cristo I think I remember that you told me something of that kind	43.89373870087316
My father has been a Jacobin more than anything else said Villefort carried by his emotion beyond the bounds of prudence and the senators robe which Napoleon cast on his shoulders only served to disguise the old man without in any degree changing him	185.75693400988732
When my father conspired it was not for the emperor it was against the Bourbons for M	79.82570572511908
Noirtier possessed this peculiarity he never projected any Utopian schemes which could never be realized but strove for possibilities and he applied to the realization of these possibilities the terrible theories of The Mountaintheories that never shrank from any means that were deemed necessary to bring about the desired result	453.8891060361915
Well said Monte Cristo it is just as I thought it was politics which brought Noirtier and M	96.06526115561945
Although General dpinay served under Napoleon did he not still retain royalist sentiments And was he not the person who was assassinated one evening on leaving a Bonapartist meeting to which he had been invited on the supposition that he favored the cause of the emperor	127.23588169582922
Villefort looked at the count almost with terror	420.224180772917
Am I mistaken then said Monte Cristo	1.6758011541802564
No sir the facts were precisely what you have stated said Madame de Villefort and it was to prevent the renewal of old feuds that M	80.43519806501678
de Villefort formed the idea of uniting in the bonds of affection the two children of these inveterate enemies	135.96094674687927
It was a sublime and charitable thought said Monte Cristo and the whole world should applaud it	147.878803089456
It would be noble to see Mademoiselle Noirtier de Villefort assuming the title of Madame Franz dpinay	144.91326312370742
Villefort shuddered and looked at Monte Cristo as if he wished to read in his countenance the real feelings which had dictated the words he had just uttered	40.74699814168498
But the count completely baffled the procureur and prevented him from discovering anything beneath the nevervarying smile he was so constantly in the habit of assuming	148.76131693077247
Although said Villefort it will be a serious thing for Valentine to lose her grandfathers fortune I do not think that M	42.46777044698679
dpinay will be frightened at this pecuniary loss	797.685092769204
He will perhaps hold me in greater esteem than the money itself seeing that I sacrifice everything in order to keep my word with him	111.91437101348842
Besides he knows that Valentine is rich in right of her mother and that she will in all probability inherit the fortune of M	72.76453306413931
and Madame de SaintMran her mothers parents who both love her tenderly	717.5781214443789
And who are fully as well worth loving and tending as M	520.8667693509914
Noirtier said Madame de Villefort besides they are to come to Paris in about a month and Valentine after the affront she has received need not consider it necessary to continue to bury herself alive by being shut up with M	155.96023611099386
The count listened with satisfaction to this tale of wounded selflove and defeated ambition	1418.4623648049903
But it seems to me said Monte Cristo and I must begin by asking your pardon for what I am about to say that if M	28.96339970100511
Noirtier disinherits Mademoiselle de Villefort because she is going to marry a man whose father he detested he can not have the same cause of complaint against this dear Edward	76.11397959883506
True said Madame de Villefort with an intonation of voice which it is impossible to describe is it not unjustshamefully unjust Poor Edward is as much M	151.3053972765821
Noirtiers grandchild as Valentine and yet if she had not been going to marry M	29.410770420330444
Noirtier would have left her all his money and supposing Valentine to be disinherited by her grandfather she will still be three times richer than he	136.37287221998258
The count listened and said no more	69.12485412659755
Count said Villefort we will not entertain you any longer with our family misfortunes	63.2584040604923
It is true that my patrimony will go to endow charitable institutions and my father will have deprived me of my lawful inheritance without any reason for doing so but I shall have the satisfaction of knowing that I have acted like a man of sense and feeling	105.95059149661499
dpinay to whom I had promised the interest of this sum shall receive it even if I endure the most cruel privations	171.6464962237799
However said Madame de Villefort returning to the one idea which incessantly occupied her mind perhaps it would be better to explain this unlucky affair to M	134.2200073533857
dpinay in order to give him the opportunity of himself renouncing his claim to the hand of Mademoiselle de Villefort	54.34939627317021
Ah that would be a great pity said Villefort	69.62070158935268
A great pity said Monte Cristo	1.0018135308798162
Undoubtedly said Villefort moderating the tones of his voice a marriage once concerted and then broken off throws a sort of discredit on a young lady then again the old reports which I was so anxious to put an end to will instantly gain ground	189.12794011383136
No it will all go well M	296.4398185333169
dpinay if he is an honorable man will consider himself more than ever pledged to Mademoiselle de Villefort unless he were actuated by a decided feeling of avarice but that is impossible	92.73626677292435
de Villefort said Monte Cristo fixing his eyes on Madame de Villefort and if I were sufficiently intimate with him to allow of giving my advice I would persuade him since I have been told M	54.08451616687578
dpinay is coming back to settle this affair at once beyond all possibility of revocation	476.83371796879305
I will answer for the success of a project which will reflect so much honor on M	129.0638353605174
The procureur arose delighted with the proposition but his wife slightly changed color	382.6094016820681
Well that is all that I wanted and I will be guided by a counsellor such as you are said he extending his hand to Monte Cristo	37.68683534868085
Therefore let everyone here look upon what has passed today as if it had not happened and as though we had never thought of such a thing as a change in our original plans	78.32737306821433
Sir said the count the world unjust as it is will be pleased with your resolution your friends will be proud of you and M	74.52255579614307
dpinay even if he took Mademoiselle de Villefort without any dowry which he will not do would be delighted with the idea of entering a family which could make such sacrifices in order to keep a promise and fulfil a duty	119.79626726004227
At the conclusion of these words the count rose to depart	60.79653270742069
Are you going to leave us count said Madame de Villefort	12.527062550062434
I am sorry to say I must do so madame I only came to remind you of your promise for Saturday	63.225839979165976
Did you fear that we should forget it	71.07473129948107
You are very good madame but M	123.54189083061303
de Villefort has so many important and urgent occupations	1865.9512721384824
My husband has given me his word sir said Madame de Villefort you have just seen him resolve to keep it when he has everything to lose and surely there is more reason for his doing so where he has everything to gain	87.75343824952161
And said Villefort is it at your house in the Champslyses that you receive your visitors	58.42591908885523
No said Monte Cristo which is precisely the reason which renders your kindness more meritoriousit is in the country	192.32512314606305
Where is it then Near Paris is it not	15.61551588541209
Very near only half a league from the Barriersit is at Auteuil	146.65678267040417
At Auteuil said Villefort true Madame de Villefort told me you lived at Auteuil since it was to your house that she was taken	41.80927063164123
And in what part of Auteuil do you reside	639.4082414345131
Rue de la Fontaine exclaimed Villefort in an agitated tone at what number	100.36336369992951
Then cried Villefort was it you who bought M	447.30469787511424
Yes replied Madame de Villefort and would you believe it count	113.6657610200898
You think this house pretty do you not	13.50962287530672
Well my husband would never live in it	69.9059258071741
Indeed returned Monte Cristo that is a prejudice on your part M	74.1769205284295
de Villefort for which I am quite at a loss to account	87.17534617222017
I do not like Auteuil sir said the procureur making an evident effort to appear calm	81.15528322427315
But I hope you will not carry your antipathy so far as to deprive me of the pleasure of your company sir said Monte Cristo	36.58987038121029
No countI hopeI assure you I shall do my best stammered Villefort	60.630618420773466
Oh said Monte Cristo I allow of no excuse	526.8383390540876
I shall be expecting you and if you fail to come I shall thinkfor how do I know to the contrarythat this house which has remained uninhabited for twenty years must have some gloomy tradition or dreadful legend connected with it	217.24757827339258
I will come countI will be sure to come said Villefort eagerly	64.13497934018368
Thank you said Monte Cristo now you must permit me to take my leave of you	37.505734657493306
You said before that you were obliged to leave us monsieur said Madame de Villefort and you were about to tell us why when your attention was called to some other subject	46.81668891469266
Indeed madame said Monte Cristo I scarcely know if I dare tell you where I am going	36.96105685420594
Well then it is to see a thing on which I have sometimes mused for hours together	273.7568774419122
So now I have told my secret	220.88935595493632
A telegraph repeated Madame de Villefort	1.3966889348594096
I had often seen one placed at the end of a road on a hillock and in the light of the sun its black arms bending in every direction always reminded me of the claws of an immense beetle and I assure you it was never without emotion that I gazed on it for I could not help thinking how wonderful it was that these various signs should be made to cleave the air with such precision as to convey to the distance of three hundred leagues the ideas and wishes of a man sitting at a table at one end of the line to another man similarly placed at the opposite extremity and all this effected by a simple act of volition on the part of the sender of the message	96.69147285936587
I began to think of genii sylphs gnomes in short of all the ministers of the occult sciences until I laughed aloud at the freaks of my own imagination	330.49278602181545
Now it never occurred to me to wish for a nearer inspection of these large insects with their long black claws for I always feared to find under their stone wings some little human genius fagged to death with cabals factions and government intrigues	598.9931897798949
But one fine day I learned that the mover of this telegraph was only a poor wretch hired for twelve hundred francs a year and employed all day not in studying the heavens like an astronomer or in gazing on the water like an angler or even in enjoying the privilege of observing the country around him but all his monotonous life was passed in watching his whitebellied blackclawed fellow insect four or five leagues distant from him	203.59542920242365
At length I felt a desire to study this living chrysalis more closely and to endeavor to understand the secret part played by these insectactors when they occupy themselves simply with pulling different pieces of string	413.0302746819131
What telegraph do you intend visiting that of the home department or of the observatory	465.9196480913179
Oh no I should find there people who would force me to understand things of which I would prefer to remain ignorant and who would try to explain to me in spite of myself a mystery which even they do not understand	81.15097508246303
Ma foi I should wish to keep my illusions concerning insects unimpaired it is quite enough to have those dissipated which I had formed of my fellowcreatures	282.1309635099465
I shall therefore not visit either of these telegraphs but one in the open country where I shall find a goodnatured simpleton who knows no more than the machine he is employed to work	99.31672085069988
You are a singular man said Villefort	19.363838613120695
What line would you advise me to study	30.69946898424501
The one that is most in use just at this time	305.36398235012706
The Spanish one you mean I suppose	23.689386991285637
Yes should you like a letter to the minister that they might explain to you	57.369259287732525
No said Monte Cristo since as I told you before I do not wish to comprehend it	26.263810198658568
The moment I understand it there will no longer exist a telegraph for me it will be nothing more than a sign from M	52.78432181855327
Montalivet transmitted to the prefect of Bayonne mystified by two Greek words tle graphein	1803.160481616641
It is the insect with black claws and the awful word which I wish to retain in my imagination in all its purity and all its importance	98.02283948949241
Go then for in the course of two hours it will be dark and you will not be able to see anything	25.49357083224359
Which is the nearest way Bayonne	1585452.6988667117
And afterwards the road to Chtillon	54428.64843124485
By the tower of Montlhry you mean	174.27508419826327
On Saturday I will tell you my impressions concerning the telegraph	132.83346693785222
At the door the count was met by the two notaries who had just completed the act which was to disinherit Valentine and who were leaving under the conviction of having done a thing which could not fail of redounding considerably to their credit	123.9263986781558
How a Gardener May Get Rid of the Dormice that Eat His Peaches	468.7069273391531
Not on the same night as he had stated but the next morning the Count of Monte Cristo went out by the Barrire dEnfer taking the road to Orlans	53.88630693129996
Leaving the village of Linas without stopping at the telegraph which flourished its great bony arms as he passed the count reached the tower of Montlhry situated as everyone knows upon the highest point of the plain of that name	206.73296617635174
At the foot of the hill the count dismounted and began to ascend by a little winding path about eighteen inches wide when he reached the summit he found himself stopped by a hedge upon which green fruit had succeeded to red and white flowers	146.32497306521847
Monte Cristo looked for the entrance to the enclosure and was not long in finding a little wooden gate working on willow hinges and fastened with a nail and string	177.3227537336932
The count soon mastered the mechanism the gate opened and he then found himself in a little garden about twenty feet long by twelve wide bounded on one side by part of the hedge which contained the ingenious contrivance we have called a gate and on the other by the old tower covered with ivy and studded with wallflowers	93.2543767058565
No one would have thought in looking at this old weatherbeaten floraldecked tower which might be likened to an elderly dame dressed up to receive her grandchildren at a birthday feast that it would have been capable of telling strange things ifin addition to the menacing ears which the proverb says all walls are provided withit had also a voice	455.1569159168054
The garden was crossed by a path of red gravel edged by a border of thick box of many years growth and of a tone and color that would have delighted the heart of Delacroix our modern Rubens	285.40753686466843
This path was formed in the shape of the figure of 8 thus in its windings making a walk of sixty feet in a garden of only twenty	117.33937250056893
Never had Flora the fresh and smiling goddess of gardeners been honored with a purer or more scrupulous worship than that which was paid to her in this little enclosure	290.12533237352886
In fact of the twenty rosetrees which formed the parterre not one bore the mark of the slug nor were there evidences anywhere of the clustering aphis which is so destructive to plants growing in a damp soil	508.5467385648539
And yet it was not because the damp had been excluded from the garden the earth black as soot the thick foliage of the trees betrayed its presence besides had natural humidity been wanting it could have been immediately supplied by artificial means thanks to a tank of water sunk in one of the corners of the garden and upon which were stationed a frog and a toad who from antipathy no doubt always remained on the two opposite sides of the basin	202.09625147250043
There was not a blade of grass to be seen in the paths or a weed in the flowerbeds no fine lady ever trained and watered her geraniums her cacti and her rhododendrons in her porcelain jardinire with more pains than this hitherto unseen gardener bestowed upon his little enclosure	543.6564720642757
Monte Cristo stopped after having closed the gate and fastened the string to the nail and cast a look around	88.34137709632473
The man at the telegraph said he must either engage a gardener or devote himself passionately to agriculture	863.7765062078729
Suddenly he struck against something crouching behind a wheelbarrow filled with leaves the something rose uttering an exclamation of astonishment and Monte Cristo found himself facing a man about fifty years old who was plucking strawberries which he was placing upon grape leaves	204.80112825597502
He had twelve leaves and about as many strawberries which on rising suddenly he let fall from his hand	186.2468264535013
You are gathering your crop sir said Monte Cristo smiling	4.249800445406963
Excuse me sir replied the man raising his hand to his cap I am not up there I know but I have only just come down	45.34063439752361
Do not let me interfere with you in anything my friend said the count gather your strawberries if indeed there are any left	125.81081648241594
I have ten left said the man for here are eleven and I had twentyone five more than last year	191.4022263356975
But I am not surprised the spring has been warm this year and strawberries require heat sir	822.7434347470177
This is the reason that instead of the sixteen I had last year I have this year you see eleven already pluckedtwelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen	730.3367921165433
Ah I miss three they were here last night sirI am sure they were hereI counted them	502.0206036207157
It must be the son of Mre Simon who has stolen them I saw him strolling about here this morning	197.70623094019183
Ah the young rascalstealing in a gardenhe does not know where that may lead him to	116.73374913686088
Certainly it is wrong said Monte Cristo but you should take into consideration the youth and greediness of the delinquent	89.72929096074637
Of course said the gardener but that does not make it the less unpleasant	65.59604620536822
But sir once more I beg pardon perhaps you are an officer that I am detaining here	157.45569067211704
And he glanced timidly at the counts blue coat	129.54266345469156
Calm yourself my friend said the count with the smile which he made at will either terrible or benevolent and which now expressed only the kindliest feeling I am not an inspector but a traveller brought here by a curiosity he half repents of since he causes you to lose your time	178.58012581909418
Ah my time is not valuable replied the man with a melancholy smile	34.66746114303391
Still it belongs to government and I ought not to waste it but having received the signal that I might rest for an hour here he glanced at the sundial for there was everything in the enclosure of Montlhry even a sundial and having ten minutes before me and my strawberries being ripe when a day longerbytheby sir do you think dormice eat them	154.524379858276
Indeed I should think not replied Monte Cristo dormice are bad neighbors for us who do not eat them preserved as the Romans did	144.3737337149756
What Did the Romans eat them said the gardenerate dormice	391.3469016899705
I have read so in Petronius said the count	103.06057664929145
Really They ca nt be nice though they do say as fat as a dormouse	369.6761629207355
It is not a wonder they are fat sleeping all day and only waking to eat all night	187.31151108441887
Last year I had four apricotsthey stole one I had one nectarine only onewell sir they ate half of it on the wall a splendid nectarineI never ate a better	714.5130741129725
That is to say the half that was leftyou understand it was exquisite sir	881.7510475849772
Ah those gentlemen never choose the worst morsels like Mre Simons son who has not chosen the worst strawberries	531.4665891635989
But this year continued the horticulturist Ill take care it shall not happen even if I should be forced to sit by the whole night to watch when the strawberries are ripe	175.30885944363382
Every man has a devouring passion in his heart as every fruit has its worm that of the telegraph man was horticulture	202.99601839168434
He began gathering the grapeleaves which screened the sun from the grapes and won the heart of the gardener	119.849343298134
Did you come here sir to see the telegraph he said	69.46700689058645
Yes if it is nt contrary to the rules	306.852006013441
Oh no said the gardener not in the least since there is no danger that anyone can possibly understand what we are saying	59.54194338789203
I have been told said the count that you do not always yourselves understand the signals you repeat	88.47264411875949
That is true sir and that is what I like best said the man smiling	40.872227747799506
Why do you like that best	1295.4199584162898
Because then I have no responsibility	10503.04395803201
I am a machine then and nothing else and so long as I work nothing more is required of me	84.62266602647557
Is it possible said Monte Cristo to himself that I can have met with a man that has no ambition That would spoil my plans	79.29996452297556
Sir said the gardener glancing at the sundial the ten minutes are almost up I must return to my post	118.52576832097691
Will you go up with me	29.642136299459942
Monte Cristo entered the tower which was divided into three stories	72.55345877710609
The tower contained implements such as spades rakes wateringpots hung against the wall this was all the furniture	271.1740784584024
The second was the mans conventional abode or rather sleepingplace it contained a few poor articles of household furniturea bed a table two chairs a stone pitcherand some dry herbs hung up to the ceiling which the count recognized as sweet peas and of which the good man was preserving the seeds he had labelled them with as much care as if he had been master botanist in the Jardin des Plantes	225.0278899352874
Does it require much study to learn the art of telegraphing asked Monte Cristo	81.46649058279547
The study does not take long it was acting as a supernumerary that was so tedious	228.17727581111544
No but then we are lodged as you perceive	680.2279592149933
Monte Cristo looked at the room	186.07175760389057
They passed to the third story it was the telegraph room	117.99050480505281
Monte Cristo looked in turn at the two iron handles by which the machine was worked	140.52692245204966
It is very interesting he said but it must be very tedious for a lifetime	69.99605392263607
At first my neck was cramped with looking at it but at the end of a year I became used to it and then we have our hours of recreation and our holidays	93.2788904830832
Those are indeed holidays to me I go into the garden I plant I prune I trim I kill the insects all day long	270.02236306172694
How long have you been here	24.99043082943616
Ten years and five as a supernumerary make fifteen	896.7216333296019
How long must you have served to claim the pension	458.39367478890495
And how much is the pension	32307.47089750448
What did you say sir asked the man	5.044812660448591
I was saying it was very interesting	264.41892315602473
And you really understand none of these signals	101.12241531251044
And have you never tried to understand them	32.811244401870226
But still there are some signals only addressed to you	242.4012673254687
Nothing new You have an hour or Tomorrow	407.50556471005336
This is simple enough said the count but look is not your correspondent putting itself in motion	245.12786284539547
And what is it sayinganything you understand	57.96379005808583
Yes it asks if I am ready	39.88679865007513
By the same sign which at the same time tells my righthand correspondent that I am ready while it gives notice to my lefthand correspondent to prepare in his turn	220.6225761595297
It is very ingenious said the count	5.058646691266446
You will see said the man proudly in five minutes he will speak	117.38683889476413
I have then five minutes said Monte Cristo to himself it is more time than I require	27.66131779457649
My dear sir will you allow me to ask you a question	13.077449972373216
And you would be pleased to have instead of this terrace of twenty feet an enclosure of two acres	151.07881835256242
Sir I should make a terrestrial paradise of it	1386.6969972470265
You live badly on your thousand francs	86.24819065824495
Badly enough but yet I do live	139.4669238205356
Yes but you have a wretchedly small garden	8690.831119311755
True the garden is not large	3797.9078177329948
And then such as it is it is filled with dormice who eat everything	126.29385543390983
Tell me should you have the misfortune to turn your head while your righthand correspondent was telegraphing	393.78730368343037
I could not repeat the signals	34327.521851451675
Not having repeated them through negligence I should be fined	659.4278318668479
The tenth of your incomethat would be fine work	185.75399115873958
Has it ever happened to you said Monte Cristo	4.213955739363706
Once sir when I was grafting a rosetree	15095.980566860246
Well suppose you were to alter a signal and substitute another	407.42797612173865
Ah that is another case I should be turned off and lose my pension	163.72457233087073
A hundred crowns yes sir so you see that I am not likely to do any of these things	27.502854747185676
Not even for fifteen years wages Come it is worth thinking about	273.4947777272767
Just so fifteen thousand francs do you understand	41.02373926504001
Sir let me see my righthand correspondent	16544.019008932803
On the contrary do not look at him but at this	78.31056839153294
What Do you not know these bits of paper	116.951782257817
Exactly there are fifteen of them	39.943317082945484
Sir my righthand correspondent is signalling	193528.04553526783
Sir you have distracted me I shall be fined	112.43062355085645
That will cost you a hundred francs you see it is your interest to take my banknotes	56.04846513249347
Sir my righthand correspondent redoubles his signals he is impatient	335.7898921501641
Never mindtake these and the count placed the packet in the mans hands	73.98034835019956
Now this is not all he said you can not live upon your fifteen thousand francs	35.08495847019685
I shall still have my place	267.1842001438003
No you will lose it for you are going to alter your correspondents message	113.65285611657193
Oh sir what are you proposing	121714.16860377001
I think I can effectually force you and Monte Cristo drew another packet from his pocket	54.18917523267822
Here are ten thousand more francs he said with the fifteen thousand already in your pocket they will make twentyfive thousand	102.47852913835935
With five thousand you can buy a pretty little house with two acres of land the remaining twenty thousand will bring you in a thousand francs a year	77.99784538701854
A garden with two acres of land	9.38638254169798
And a thousand francs a year	10.185355822002053
Come take them and Monte Cristo forced the banknotes into his hand	45.04176839084705
Monte Cristo took a paper from his pocket upon which were drawn three signs with numbers to indicate the order in which they were to be worked	82.06537776373251
There you see it will not take long	107.09078874303641
Do this and you will have nectarines and all the rest	160.6794724932407
The shot told red with fever while the large drops fell from his brow the man executed one after the other the three signs given by the count in spite of the frightful contortions of the righthand correspondent who not understanding the change began to think the gardener had gone mad	108.48069519153407
As to the lefthand one he conscientiously repeated the same signals which were finally transmitted to the Minister of the Interior	199.60279522365906
Now you are rich said Monte Cristo	2.939449881302957
Yes replied the man but at what a price	278.57848313064034
I do not wish to cause you any remorse believe me then when I swear to you that you have wronged no man but on the contrary have benefited mankind	143.919837861052
The man looked at the banknotes felt them counted them turned pale then red then rushed into his room to drink a glass of water but he had no time to reach the waterjug and fainted in the midst of his dried herbs	84.36796467390742
Five minutes after the new telegram reached the minister Debray had the horses put to his carriage and drove to Danglars house	104.97880580094578
Has your husband any Spanish bonds he asked of the baroness	55.53252063782643
I think so indeed He has six millions worth	114.38892581553993
He must sell them at whatever price	8805.520861238523
Because Don Carlos has fled from Bourges and has returned to Spain	71.04498620675973
How do you know Debray shrugged his shoulders	443.6165708081069
The idea of asking how I hear the news he said	54.595685496375225
The baroness did not wait for a repetition she ran to her husband who immediately hastened to his agent and ordered him to sell at any price	85.36563196714987
When it was seen that Danglars sold the Spanish funds fell directly	640.5274143397717
Danglars lost five hundred thousand francs but he rid himself of all his Spanish shares	79.29673547214423
The same evening the following was read in Le Messager	194.14338479669968
The king Don Carlos has escaped the vigilance of his guardians at Bourges and has returned to Spain by the Catalonian frontier	160.95795982579529
Barcelona has risen in his favor	299.3357168918266
All that evening nothing was spoken of but the foresight of Danglars who had sold his shares and of the luck of the stockjobber who only lost five hundred thousand francs by such a blow	73.17644614110382
Those who had kept their shares or bought those of Danglars looked upon themselves as ruined and passed a very bad night	266.9879418160317
Next morning Le Moniteur contained the following	28.436998435212445
It was without any foundation that Le Messager yesterday announced the flight of Don Carlos and the revolt of Barcelona	146.87163630002664
The king Don Carlos has not left Bourges and the peninsula is in the enjoyment of profound peace	355.17106706209574
A telegraphic signal improperly interpreted owing to the fog was the cause of this error	106.35120589250917
The funds rose one per cent higher than before they had fallen	29.577728195555444
This reckoning his loss and what he had missed gaining made the difference of a million to Danglars	188.05290988906785
Good said Monte Cristo to Morrel who was at his house when the news arrived of the strange reverse of fortune of which Danglars had been the victim I have just made a discovery for twentyfive thousand francs for which I would have paid a hundred thousand	52.32740441515875
What have you discovered asked Morrel	2.7132440468682684
I have just discovered how a gardener may get rid of the dormice that eat his peaches	308.58507628189574
At first sight the exterior of the house at Auteuil gave no indications of splendor nothing one would expect from the destined residence of the magnificent Count of Monte Cristo but this simplicity was according to the will of its master who positively ordered nothing to be altered outside	123.29147850533471
Indeed almost before the door opened the scene changed	111.27172878158592
Bertuccio had outdone himself in the taste displayed in furnishing and in the rapidity with which it was executed	157.47396897327098
It is told that the Duc dAntin removed in a single night a whole avenue of trees that annoyed Louis XIV	252.87520381400745
Bertuccio planted an entirely bare court with poplars large spreading sycamores to shade the different parts of the house and in the foreground instead of the usual pavingstones half hidden by the grass there extended a lawn but that morning laid down and upon which the water was yet glistening	238.2695638122717
For the rest the orders had been issued by the count he himself had given a plan to Bertuccio marking the spot where each tree was to be planted and the shape and extent of the lawn which was to take the place of the pavingstones	99.62945261691758
Thus the house had become unrecognizable and Bertuccio himself declared that he scarcely knew it encircled as it was by a framework of trees	191.62417628879905
The overseer would not have objected while he was about it to have made some improvements in the garden but the count had positively forbidden it to be touched	119.22987937436827
Bertuccio made amends however by loading the antechambers staircases and mantlepieces with flowers	959.1196968227669
What above all manifested the shrewdness of the steward and the profound science of the master the one in carrying out the ideas of the other was that this house which appeared only the night before so sad and gloomy impregnated with that sickly smell one can almost fancy to be the smell of time had in a single day acquired the aspect of life was scented with its masters favorite perfumes and had the very light regulated according to his wish	165.57514621403791
When the count arrived he had under his touch his books and arms his eyes rested upon his favorite pictures his dogs whose caresses he loved welcomed him in the antechamber the birds whose songs delighted him cheered him with their music and the house awakened from its long sleep like the sleeping beauty in the wood lived sang and bloomed like the houses we have long cherished and in which when we are forced to leave them we leave a part of our souls	224.33931051894265
The servants passed gayly along the fine courtyard some belonging to the kitchens gliding down the stairs restored but the previous day as if they had always inhabited the house others filling the coachhouses where the equipages encased and numbered appeared to have been installed for the last fifty years and in the stables the horses replied with neighs to the grooms who spoke to them with much more respect than many servants pay their masters	153.5474748576973
The library was divided into two parts on either side of the wall and contained upwards of two thousand volumes one division was entirely devoted to novels and even the volume which had been published but the day before was to be seen in its place in all the dignity of its red and gold binding	108.36702865099028
On the other side of the house to match with the library was the conservatory ornamented with rare flowers that bloomed in china jars and in the midst of the greenhouse marvellous alike to sight and smell was a billiardtable which looked as if it had been abandoned during the past hour by players who had left the balls on the cloth	173.13483454872664
One chamber alone had been respected by the magnificent Bertuccio	329.1391415965461
Before this room to which you could ascend by the grand and go out by the back staircase the servants passed with curiosity and Bertuccio with terror	117.40088867549231
At five oclock precisely the count arrived before the house at Auteuil followed by Ali	25.069485892922543
Bertuccio was awaiting this arrival with impatience mingled with uneasiness he hoped for some compliments while at the same time he feared to have frowns	102.47980575934322
Monte Cristo descended into the courtyard walked all over the house without giving any sign of approbation or pleasure until he entered his bedroom situated on the opposite side to the closed room then he approached a little piece of furniture made of rosewood which he had noticed at a previous visit	90.15083541295944
That can only be to hold gloves he said	503.90159235870254
Will your excellency deign to open it said the delighted Bertuccio and you will find gloves in it	157.0712571232213
Elsewhere the count found everything he requiredsmellingbottles cigars knickknacks	15658.046582403393
Bertuccio left enraptured so great so powerful and real was the influence exercised by this man over all who surrounded him	118.21145228174386
At precisely six oclock the clatter of horses hoofs was heard at the entrance door it was our captain of Spahis who had arrived on Mdah	100.35400745531506
I am sure I am the first cried Morrel I did it on purpose to have you a minute to myself before everyone came	138.98966002517244
Julie and Emmanuel have a thousand things to tell you	56.661517945110006
Ah really this is magnificent But tell me count will your people take care of my horse	94.5157564843909
Do not alarm yourself my dear Maximilianthey understand	772.1011788899885
I mean because he wants petting	215684.78575228257
If you had seen at what a pace he camelike the wind	412.4870485496579
I should think soa horse that cost 5000 francs said Monte Cristo in the tone which a father would use towards a son	48.93517849810913
Do you regret them asked Morrel with his open laugh	15.794279765162978
I Certainly not replied the count	4.02924016735861
No I should only regret if the horse had not proved good	115.68362452514792
It is so good that I have distanced M	239.0818911373242
de ChteauRenaud one of the best riders in France and M	87.77465321439163
Debray who both mount the ministers Arabians and close on their heels are the horses of Madame Danglars who always go at six leagues an hour	150.93182540489866
Then they follow you asked Monte Cristo	2.7911089449288244
And at the same minute a carriage with smoking horses accompanied by two mounted gentlemen arrived at the gate which opened before them	144.62710218649096
The carriage drove round and stopped at the steps followed by the horsemen	39.42948753376568
The instant Debray had touched the ground he was at the carriagedoor	67.33961482586223
He offered his hand to the baroness who descending took it with a peculiarity of manner imperceptible to everyone but Monte Cristo	144.79653150362867
But nothing escaped the counts notice and he observed a little note passed with the facility that indicates frequent practice from the hand of Madame Danglars to that of the ministers secretary	169.66197912626708
After his wife the banker descended as pale as though he had issued from his tomb instead of his carriage	84.1020089458475
Madame Danglars threw a rapid and inquiring glance which could only be interpreted by Monte Cristo around the courtyard over the peristyle and across the front of the house then repressing a slight emotion which must have been seen on her countenance if she had not kept her color she ascended the steps saying to Morrel	84.22354857339772
Sir if you were a friend of mine I should ask you if you would sell your horse	48.01566115029466
Morrel smiled with an expression very like a grimace and then turned round to Monte Cristo as if to ask him to extricate him from his embarrassment	65.99479239367459
Ah madame he said why did you not make that request of me	25.79853976473344
With you sir replied the baroness one can wish for nothing one is so sure to obtain it	112.96846590333452
If it were so with M	53.96056993421016
Unfortunately replied the count I am witness that M	131.29878138384055
Morrel can not give up his horse his honor being engaged in keeping it	218.8273104156113
He laid a wager he would tame Mdah in the space of six months	211.03622902625042
You understand now that if he were to get rid of the animal before the time named he would not only lose his bet but people would say he was afraid and a brave captain of Spahis can not risk this even to gratify a pretty woman which is in my opinion one of the most sacred obligations in the world	91.6757551429599
You see my position madame said Morrel bestowing a grateful smile on Monte Cristo	51.961109557709065
It seems to me said Danglars in his coarse tone illconcealed by a forced smile that you have already got horses enough	107.24472016472106
Madame Danglars seldom allowed remarks of this kind to pass unnoticed but to the surprise of the young people she pretended not to hear it and said nothing	79.79243374312526
Monte Cristo smiled at her unusual humility and showed her two immense porcelain jars over which wound marine plants of a size and delicacy that nature alone could produce	491.31023639012795
Why said she you could plant one of the chestnuttrees in the Tuileries inside How can such enormous jars have been manufactured	548.003983101911
Ah madame replied Monte Cristo you must not ask of us the manufacturers of fine porcelain such a question	129.48138151005
It is the work of another age constructed by the genii of earth and water	307.5966776874571
How soat what period can that have been	53.12668248926837
I do not know I have only heard that an emperor of China had an oven built expressly and that in this oven twelve jars like this were successively baked	502.1794108659838
Two broke from the heat of the fire the other ten were sunk three hundred fathoms deep into the sea	93.21442415028434
The sea knowing what was required of her threw over them her weeds encircled them with coral and encrusted them with shells the whole was cemented by two hundred years beneath these almost impervious depths for a revolution carried away the emperor who wished to make the trial and only left the documents proving the manufacture of the jars and their descent into the sea	205.4315279168197
At the end of two hundred years the documents were found and they thought of bringing up the jars	121.96295996993078
Divers descended in machines made expressly on the discovery into the bay where they were thrown but of ten three only remained the rest having been broken by the waves	148.67216586937573
I am fond of these jars upon which perhaps misshapen frightful monsters have fixed their cold dull eyes and in which myriads of small fish have slept seeking a refuge from the pursuit of their enemies	320.8160402452318
Meanwhile Danglars who had cared little for curiosities was mechanically tearing off the blossoms of a splendid orangetree one after another	429.4876325402934
When he had finished with the orangetree he began at the cactus but this not being so easily plucked as the orangetree pricked him dreadfully	381.79652322797006
He shuddered and rubbed his eyes as though awaking from a dream	66.43828217003653
Sir said Monte Cristo to him I do not recommend my pictures to you who possess such splendid paintings but nevertheless here are two by Hobbema a Paul Potter a Mieris two by Gerard Douw a Raphael a Van Dyck a Zurbaran and two or three by Murillo worth looking at	438.05327579115584
Stay said Debray I recognize this Hobbema	1540.881331873009
Yes it was proposed for the Museum	1092.9627614344508
Which I believe does not contain one said Monte Cristo	41.77644317666769
No and yet they refused to buy it	50.044332837632055
You pretend not to knowbecause government was not rich enough	387.5553509568051
Ah pardon me said ChteauRenaud I have heard of these things every day during the last eight years and I can not understand them yet	31.540536273847312
You will by and by said Debray	344.3134712117249
Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti and Count Andrea Cavalcanti announced Baptistin	95.74254902491073
A black satin stock fresh from the makers hands gray moustaches a bold eye a majors uniform ornamented with three medals and five crossesin fact the thorough bearing of an old soldiersuch was the appearance of Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti that tender father with whom we are already acquainted	327.6932585691833
Close to him dressed in entirely new clothes advanced smilingly Count Andrea Cavalcanti the dutiful son whom we also know	390.56545794579813
The three young people were talking together	273.756787697429
On the entrance of the newcomers their eyes glanced from father to son and then naturally enough rested on the latter whom they began criticising	347.11967095904066
Yes said ChteauRenaud these Italians are well named and badly dressed	258.1181496200519
You are fastidious ChteauRenaud replied Debray those clothes are well cut and quite new	368.5909597674612
That is just what I find fault with	766.173223493153
That gentleman appears to be well dressed for the first time in his life	49.68347475983824
Who are those gentlemen asked Danglars of Monte Cristo	8.125739854935995
That tells me their name and nothing else	168.82631882422123
You do not know the Italian nobility the Cavalcanti are all descended from princes	625.9127583234056
They have some business with you I think from what they told me the day before yesterday	34.59487167093455
I indeed invited them here today on your account	61.51666135404304
I will introduce you to them	445.47457173071984
But they appear to speak French with a very pure accent said Danglars	81.61175006743372
The son has been educated in a college in the south I believe near Marseilles	206.5120679141941
You will find him quite enthusiastic	22639.566310131053
Upon what subject asked Madame Danglars	1.9530866207813826
He has made up his mind to take a wife from Paris	57.236824611496694
A fine idea that of his said Danglars shrugging his shoulders	37.224311959247586
Madame Danglars looked at her husband with an expression which at any other time would have indicated a storm but for the second time she controlled herself	64.18973280640841
The baron appears thoughtful today said Monte Cristo to her are they going to put him in the ministry	41.45450953898043
More likely he has been speculating on the Bourse and has lost money	176.3157159524192
and Madame de Villefort cried Baptistin	203.55924024961374
de Villefort notwithstanding his selfcontrol was visibly affected and when Monte Cristo touched his hand he felt it tremble	98.77803377447228
Certainly women alone know how to dissimulate said Monte Cristo to himself glancing at Madame Danglars who was smiling on the procureur and embracing his wife	63.51747600621841
After a short time the count saw Bertuccio who until then had been occupied on the other side of the house glide into an adjoining room	41.04535198466674
Your excellency has not stated the number of guests	62.9920088369876
Bertuccio glanced through the door which was ajar	155.42050090437976
What is the matter said the count	6.649647156825198
The one with a white dress and so many diamondsthe fair one	309.29617690242287
I do not know her name but it is she sir it is she	51.70633581077275
The woman of the gardenshe that was enceinteshe who was walking while she waited for	121.22618350504311
Bertuccio stood at the open door with his eyes starting and his hair on end	31.903888672473098
Waiting for whom Bertuccio without answering pointed to Villefort with something of the gesture Macbeth uses to point out Banquo	897.7966313904949
Oh oh he at length muttered do you see	144.80509215155612
de Villefort the kings attorney Certainly I see him	185.55675217502824
Then I did not kill him	3.255276532767754
Really I think you are going mad good Bertuccio said the count	65.35853219058099
No you see plainly he is not dead	21.363443018917497
Instead of striking between the sixth and seventh left ribs as your countrymen do you must have struck higher or lower and life is very tenacious in these lawyers or rather there is no truth in anything you have told meit was a fright of the imagination a dream of your fancy	294.2291881869659
You went to sleep full of thoughts of vengeance they weighed heavily upon your stomach you had the nightmarethats all	246.4840205899396
Come calm yourself and reckon them upM	24864.07680756378
and Madame de Villefort two M	2015.2500748454038
Morrel seven Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti eight	2842.840462828256
Stop You are in a shocking hurry to be offyou forget one of my guests	224.98423552721917
Lean a little to the left	355.41470599517805
Andrea Cavalcanti the young man in a black coat looking at Murillos Madonna now he is turning	219.44810364785695
This time Bertuccio would have uttered an exclamation had not a look from Monte Cristo silenced him	109.4074904854029
Halfpast six oclock has just struck M	53.51669074405789
Bertuccio said the count severely I ordered dinner at that hour and I do not like to wait and he returned to his guests while Bertuccio leaning against the wall succeeded in reaching the diningroom	108.624818359393
Five minutes afterwards the doors of the drawingroom were thrown open and Bertuccio appearing said with a violent effort The dinner waits	143.68794745557003
The Count of Monte Cristo offered his arm to Madame de Villefort	17.689287128030667
de Villefort he said will you conduct the Baroness Danglars	97.79704025440313
Villefort complied and they passed on to the diningroom	64.32719018072464
It was evident that one sentiment affected all the guests on entering the diningroom	308.3554349693491
Each one asked what strange influence had brought them to this house and yet astonished even uneasy though they were they still felt that they would not like to be absent	72.58789835806905
The recent events the solitary and eccentric position of the count his enormous nay almost incredible fortune should have made men cautious and have altogether prevented ladies visiting a house where there was no one of their own sex to receive them and yet curiosity had been enough to lead them to overleap the bounds of prudence and decorum	203.0192290612955
And all present even including Cavalcanti and his son notwithstanding the stiffness of the one and the carelessness of the other were thoughtful on finding themselves assembled at the house of this incomprehensible man	108.74191254182952
Madame Danglars had started when Villefort on the counts invitation offered his arm and Villefort felt that his glance was uneasy beneath his gold spectacles when he felt the arm of the baroness press upon his own	90.32580188958471
None of this had escaped the count and even by this mere contact of individuals the scene had already acquired considerable interest for an observer	293.5468693771717
de Villefort had on the right hand Madame Danglars on his left Morrel	53.91563120741744
The count was seated between Madame de Villefort and Danglars the other seats were filled by Debray who was placed between the two Cavalcanti and by ChteauRenaud seated between Madame de Villefort and Morrel	47.06722699346767
The repast was magnificent Monte Cristo had endeavored completely to overturn the Parisian ideas and to feed the curiosity as much as the appetite of his guests	106.02961609060347
It was an Oriental feast that he offered to them but of such a kind as the Arabian fairies might be supposed to prepare	97.16040584456411
Every delicious fruit that the four quarters of the globe could provide was heaped in vases from China and jars from Japan	909.1682084778881
Rare birds retaining their most brilliant plumage enormous fish spread upon massive silver dishes together with every wine produced in the Archipelago Asia Minor or the Cape sparkling in bottles whose grotesque shape seemed to give an additional flavor to the draughtall these like one of the displays with which Apicius of old gratified his guests passed in review before the eyes of the astonished Parisians who understood that it was possible to expend a thousand louis upon a dinner for ten persons but only on the condition of eating pearls like Cleopatra or drinking refined gold like Lorenzo de Medici	425.3548308711669
Monte Cristo noticed the general astonishment and began laughing and joking about it	522.8073446535126
Gentlemen he said you will admit that when arrived at a certain degree of fortune the superfluities of life are all that can be desired and the ladies will allow that after having risen to a certain eminence of position the ideal alone can be more exalted	179.19637402432224
Now to follow out this reasoning what is the marvellousthat which we do not understand	107.62455804254073
What is it that we really desirethat which we can not obtain	292.11972552677963
Now to see things which I can not understand to procure impossibilities these are the study of my life	120.65977706923361
I gratify my wishes by two meansmy will and my money	350.94755298053923
I take as much interest in the pursuit of some whim as you do M	86.86178447337139
Danglars in promoting a new railway line you M	543.2972196937134
de Villefort in condemning a culprit to death you M	286.4898789269641
Debray in pacifying a kingdom you M	233.2336340222564
de ChteauRenaud in pleasing a woman and you Morrel in breaking a horse that no one can ride	120.15617701830067
For example you see these two fish one brought from fifty leagues beyond St	276.727937405956
Petersburg the other five leagues from Naples	153.61877022541574
Is it not amusing to see them both on the same table	52.04172399029048
What are the two fish asked Danglars	43.458117448519445
ChteauRenaud who has lived in Russia will tell you the name of one and Major Cavalcanti who is an Italian will tell you the name of the other	66.2491605830837
This one is I think a sterlet said ChteauRenaud	552.388729715081
And that one if I mistake not a lamprey	724.8531988929485
Danglars ask these gentlemen where they are caught	129.24983349212638
Sterlets said ChteauRenaud are only found in the Volga	359.70901785804693
And said Cavalcanti I know that Lake Fusaro alone supplies lampreys of that size	2262.640893530772
Exactly one comes from the Volga and the other from Lake Fusaro	311.7824186121191
Impossible cried all the guests simultaneously	387034.12946636195
Well this is just what amuses me said Monte Cristo	44.05652426238822
I am like Nerocupitor impossibilium and that is what is amusing you at this moment	51.65715443513704
This fish which seems so exquisite to you is very likely no better than perch or salmon but it seemed impossible to procure it and here it is	120.4340793762624
But how could you have these fish brought to France	191.3720404054374
Each fish was brought over in a caskone filled with river herbs and weeds the other with rushes and lake plants they were placed in a wagon built on purpose and thus the sterlet lived twelve days the lamprey eight and both were alive when my cook seized them killing one with milk and the other with wine	321.10037136337417
You do not believe me M	270.5562648098678
I can not help doubting answered Danglars with his stupid smile	73.87081599715872
Baptistin said the count have the other fish brought inthe sterlet and the lamprey which came in the other casks and which are yet alive	298.899093549213
Danglars opened his bewildered eyes the company clapped their hands	643.6600508189372
Four servants carried in two casks covered with aquatic plants and in each of which was breathing a fish similar to those on the table	117.29634323861232
But why have two of each sort asked Danglars	277.684767330904
Merely because one might have died carelessly answered Monte Cristo	165.3968785632137
You are certainly an extraordinary man said Danglars and philosophers may well say it is a fine thing to be rich	50.047201699584924
And to have ideas added Madame Danglars	23.42228999292571
Oh do not give me credit for this madame it was done by the Romans who much esteemed them and Pliny relates that they sent slaves from Ostia to Rome who carried on their heads fish which he calls the mulus and which from the description must probably be the goldfish	247.94359307233225
It was also considered a luxury to have them alive it being an amusing sight to see them die for when dying they change color three or four times and like the rainbow when it disappears pass through all the prismatic shades after which they were sent to the kitchen	229.19852154136655
Their agony formed part of their meritif they were not seen alive they were despised when dead	243.49424938958032
Yes said Debray but then Ostia is only a few leagues from Rome	146.95851884851902
True said Monte Cristo but what would be the use of living eighteen hundred years after Lucullus if we can do no better than he could	101.97530329236085
The two Cavalcanti opened their enormous eyes but had the good sense not to say anything	140.42773622038564
All this is very extraordinary said ChteauRenaud still what I admire the most I confess is the marvellous promptitude with which your orders are executed	150.0471407359647
Is it not true that you only bought this house five or six days ago	38.16104144957327
Well I am sure it is quite transformed since last week	391.0149629528915
If I remember rightly it had another entrance and the courtyard was paved and empty while today we have a splendid lawn bordered by trees which appear to be a hundred years old	109.64196452477503
Why not I am fond of grass and shade said Monte Cristo	44.31391250334664
Yes said Madame de Villefort the door was towards the road before and on the day of my miraculous escape you brought me into the house from the road I remember	68.93346846490793
Yes madame said Monte Cristo but I preferred having an entrance which would allow me to see the Bois de Boulogne over my gate	74.48909992890732
In four days said Morrel it is extraordinary	42.55039630198142
Indeed said ChteauRenaud it seems quite miraculous to make a new house out of an old one for it was very old and dull too	110.88146122499869
I recollect coming for my mother to look at it when M	97.45690170082399
de SaintMran advertised it for sale two or three years ago	69.98374295940702
de SaintMran said Madame de Villefort then this house belonged to M	47.55413546859478
de SaintMran before you bought it	16.319528391738
It appears so replied Monte Cristo	1.0017316341231266
Is it possible that you do not know of whom you purchased it	50.805118559246964
Quite so my steward transacts all this business for me	165.0442259875876
It is certainly ten years since the house had been occupied said ChteauRenaud and it was quite melancholy to look at it with the blinds closed the doors locked and the weeds in the court	51.31541436576693
Really if the house had not belonged to the fatherinlaw of the procureur one might have thought it some accursed place where a horrible crime had been committed	110.5198610641526
Villefort who had hitherto not tasted the three or four glasses of rare wine which were placed before him here took one and drank it off	115.18617748065854
Monte Cristo allowed a short time to elapse and then said	80.8719459067623
It is singular baron but the same idea came across me the first time I came here it looked so gloomy I should never have bought it if my steward had not taken the matter into his own hands	82.08386191424208
Perhaps the fellow had been bribed by the notary	160.66158958358622
It is probable stammered out Villefort trying to smile but I can assure you that I had nothing to do with any such proceeding	44.227939388764455
This house is part of Valentines marriageportion and M	881.3479849867675
de SaintMran wished to sell it for if it had remained another year or two uninhabited it would have fallen to ruin	105.952664742633
It was Morrels turn to become pale	339.17753135458264
There was above all one room continued Monte Cristo very plain in appearance hung with red damask which I know not why appeared to me quite dramatic	164.13907070120726
Why so said Danglars why dramatic	851404.0635089114
Can we account for instinct said Monte Cristo	4.468662845344169
Are there not some places where we seem to breathe sadnesswhy we can not tell	148.9935921878584
It is a chain of recollectionsan idea which carries you back to other times to other placeswhich very likely have no connection with the present time and place	450.01497776169924
And there is something in this room which reminds me forcibly of the chamber of the Marquise de Ganges10 or Desdemona	237.04444557908266
Stay since we have finished dinner I will show it to you and then we will take coffee in the garden	31.073235074541135
Monte Cristo looked inquiringly at his guests	61.38193765028938
Madame de Villefort rose Monte Cristo did the same and the rest followed their example	88.88945983770985
Villefort and Madame Danglars remained for a moment as if rooted to their seats they questioned each other with vague and stupid glances	121.73669018708686
Did you hear said Madame Danglars	1.7861108990753147
We must go replied Villefort offering his arm	156.63843332300158
The others attracted by curiosity were already scattered in different parts of the house for they thought the visit would not be limited to the one room and that at the same time they would obtain a view of the rest of the building of which Monte Cristo had created a palace	60.35200748173067
Each one went out by the open doors	166.48207977507505
Monte Cristo waited for the two who remained then when they had passed he brought up the rear and on his face was a smile which if they could have understood it would have alarmed them much more than a visit to the room they were about to enter	57.34726514059237
They began by walking through the apartments many of which were fitted up in the Eastern style with cushions and divans instead of beds and pipes instead of furniture	149.71858578639376
The drawingrooms were decorated with the rarest pictures by the old masters the boudoirs hung with draperies from China of fanciful colors fantastic design and wonderful texture	1019.180326296105
At length they arrived at the famous room	116.6986912522289
There was nothing particular about it excepting that although daylight had disappeared it was not lighted and everything in it was oldfashioned while the rest of the rooms had been redecorated	148.640073938673
These two causes were enough to give it a gloomy aspect	78.45826978392617
cried Madame de Villefort it is really frightful	87.18263060412517
Madame Danglars tried to utter a few words but was not heard	32.39493736848066
Many observations were made the import of which was a unanimous opinion that there was something sinister about the room	254.23877408072983
Is it not so asked Monte Cristo	2.0744371394634116
Look at that large clumsy bed hung with such gloomy bloodcolored drapery And those two crayon portraits that have faded from the dampness do they not seem to say with their pale lips and staring eyes We have seen	264.84385538375534
Villefort became livid Madame Danglars fell into a long seat placed near the chimney	58.914678079334706
Oh said Madame de Villefort smiling are you courageous enough to sit down upon the very seat perhaps upon which the crime was committed	91.30635891939622
And then said Monte Cristo this is not all	49.66433140877575
What is there more said Debray who had not failed to notice the agitation of Madame Danglars	23.28041935630566
Ah what else is there said Danglars for at present I can not say that I have seen anything extraordinary	38.75550367233868
Ah said he we have at Pisa Ugolinos tower at Ferrara Tassos prison at Rimini the room of Francesca and Paolo	2023.9582960168923
Yes but you have not this little staircase said Monte Cristo opening a door concealed by the drapery	49.81253559871931
Look at it and tell me what you think of it	12.12219647434229
What a wickedlooking crooked staircase said ChteauRenaud with a smile	12.089780637840173
I do not know whether the wine of Chios produces melancholy but certainly everything appears to me black in this house said Debray	203.36431870056884
Ever since Valentines dowry had been mentioned Morrel had been silent and sad	59.84064612744326
Can you imagine said Monte Cristo some Othello or Abb de Ganges one stormy dark night descending these stairs step by step carrying a load which he wishes to hide from the sight of man if not from God	300.7847400624964
Madame Danglars half fainted on the arm of Villefort who was obliged to support himself against the wall	25.024231724244736
Ah madame cried Debray what is the matter with you how pale you look	59.9858706386713
It is very evident what is the matter with her said Madame de Villefort M	20.5683915916616
de Monte Cristo is relating horrible stories to us doubtless intending to frighten us to death	368.9510517061058
Yes said Villefort really count you frighten the ladies	416.11280423102636
What is the matter asked Debray in a whisper of Madame Danglars	21.910900840483176
Nothing she replied with a violent effort	41.66535086710488
I want air that is all	52.43284534764016
Will you come into the garden said Debray advancing towards the back staircase	48.14899670075829
No no she answered I would rather remain here	110.57670658825192
Are you really frightened madame said Monte Cristo	2.704138016938319
Oh no sir said Madame Danglars but you suppose scenes in a manner which gives them the appearance of reality	66.78579327189202
Ah yes said Monte Cristo smiling it is all a matter of imagination	43.44514389680919
Why should we not imagine this the apartment of an honest mother And this bed with red hangings a bed visited by the goddess Lucina And that mysterious staircase the passage through which not to disturb their sleep the doctor and nurse pass or even the father carrying the sleeping child	241.02301057208635
Here Madame Danglars instead of being calmed by the soft picture uttered a groan and fainted	211.4436793940063
Madame Danglars is ill said Villefort it would be better to take her to her carriage	30.36571545119963
Oh mon Dieu said Monte Cristo and I have forgotten my smellingbottle	50.205036165472194
I have mine said Madame de Villefort and she passed over to Monte Cristo a bottle full of the same kind of red liquid whose good properties the count had tested on Edward	101.16860390082624
Ah said Monte Cristo taking it from her hand	44.896548732646444
Yes she said at your advice I have made the trial	53.834996444410926
Madame Danglars was carried into the adjoining room Monte Cristo dropped a very small portion of the red liquid upon her lips she returned to consciousness	52.09970544345419
Ah she cried what a frightful dream	110.64222620991814
Villefort pressed her hand to let her know it was not a dream	45.541976692991504
Danglars but as he was not especially interested in poetical ideas he had gone into the garden and was talking with Major Cavalcanti on the projected railway from Leghorn to Florence	131.0052451539725
He took the arm of Madame Danglars and conducted her into the garden where they found Danglars taking coffee between the Cavalcanti	55.72805363830249
Really madame he said did I alarm you much	155.81092164421733
Oh no sir she answered but you know things impress us differently according to the mood of our minds	314.74748540079486
And then you know he said an idea a supposition is sufficient	259.1574305242043
Well said Monte Cristo you may believe me if you like but it is my opinion that a crime has been committed in this house	34.0574386270188
Take care said Madame de Villefort the kings attorney is here	20.027494220271702
Ah replied Monte Cristo since that is the case I will take advantage of his presence to make my declaration	47.273669808087824
Oh this is very interesting said Debray if there really has been a crime we will investigate it	100.0877122683488
There has been a crime said Monte Cristo	8.962716980658577
Come this way gentlemen come M	379.34697596531
Villefort for a declaration to be available should be made before the competent authorities	348.05325282955414
He then took Villeforts arm and at the same time holding that of Madame Danglars under his own he dragged the procureur to the plantaintree where the shade was thickest	80.91051797976799
Stay said Monte Cristo here in this very spot and he stamped upon the ground I had the earth dug up and fresh mould put in to refresh these old trees well my man digging found a box or rather the ironwork of a box in the midst of which was the skeleton of a newly born infant	213.81449528249104
Monte Cristo felt the arm of Madame Danglars stiffen while that of Villefort trembled	143.7518849705405
A newly born infant repeated Debray this affair becomes serious	556.8407864756861
Well said ChteauRenaud I was not wrong just now then when I said that houses had souls and faces like men and that their exteriors carried the impress of their characters	338.9163796076585
This house was gloomy because it was remorseful it was remorseful because it concealed a crime	307.12845782970436
Who said it was a crime asked Villefort with a last effort	39.577443828307075
How is it not a crime to bury a living child in a garden cried Monte Cristo	66.48594208043276
And pray what do you call such an action	234.69401218829466
But who said it was buried alive	728.3291524200204
Why bury it there if it were dead This garden has never been a cemetery	191.98102348067775
What is done to infanticides in this country asked Major Cavalcanti innocently	453.28622840615134
Oh their heads are soon cut off said Danglars	42.22624564283868
I think so am I not right M	270.9207088906826
Yes count replied Villefort in a voice now scarcely human	96.47387247538768
Monte Cristo seeing that the two persons for whom he had prepared this scene could scarcely endure it and not wishing to carry it too far said	83.4446074018313
Come gentlemensome coffee we seem to have forgotten it and he conducted the guests back to the table on the lawn	43.661140778326164
Indeed count said Madame Danglars I am ashamed to own it but all your frightful stories have so upset me that I must beg you to let me sit down and she fell into a chair	45.60057475260413
Monte Cristo bowed and went to Madame de Villefort	3.6647598692674372
I think Madame Danglars again requires your bottle he said	149.53189051479592
But before Madame de Villefort could reach her friend the procureur had found time to whisper to Madame Danglars I must speak to you	70.54125500611764
In my office or in the court if you likethat is the surest place	182.0537078076296
At this moment Madame de Villefort approached	11.303672974247007
Thanks my dear friend said Madame Danglars trying to smile it is over now and I am much better	33.348823262812175
The evening passed on Madame de Villefort expressed a desire to return to Paris which Madame Danglars had not dared to do notwithstanding the uneasiness she experienced	57.77604691578889
de Villefort was the first to give the signal of departure	89.58411746582296
He offered a seat in his landau to Madame Danglars that she might be under the care of his wife	47.8560081267563
Danglars absorbed in an interesting conversation with M	112.74172278692515
Cavalcanti he paid no attention to anything that was passing	60.51319426359201
While Monte Cristo had begged the smellingbottle of Madame de Villefort he had noticed the approach of Villefort to Madame Danglars and he soon guessed all that had passed between them though the words had been uttered in so low a voice as hardly to be heard by Madame Danglars	40.114568095325566
Without opposing their arrangements he allowed Morrel ChteauRenaud and Debray to leave on horseback and the ladies in M	86.14146852155444
Danglars more and more delighted with Major Cavalcanti had offered him a seat in his carriage	37.48802044717726
Andrea Cavalcanti found his tilbury waiting at the door the groom in every respect a caricature of the English fashion was standing on tiptoe to hold a large irongray horse	152.9926263074266
Andrea had spoken very little during dinner he was an intelligent lad and he feared to utter some absurdity before so many grand people amongst whom with dilating eyes he saw the kings attorney	191.16867043930398
Then he had been seized upon by Danglars who with a rapid glance at the stiffnecked old major and his modest son and taking into consideration the hospitality of the count made up his mind that he was in the society of some nabob come to Paris to finish the worldly education of his heir	104.4061096338448
He contemplated with unspeakable delight the large diamond which shone on the majors little finger for the major like a prudent man in case of any accident happening to his banknotes had immediately converted them into an available asset	259.1566928991929
Then after dinner on the pretext of business he questioned the father and son upon their mode of living and the father and son previously informed that it was through Danglars the one was to receive his 48000 francs and the other 50000 livres annually were so full of affability that they would have shaken hands even with the bankers servants so much did their gratitude need an object to expend itself upon	161.24162348667787
One thing above all the rest heightened the respect nay almost the veneration of Danglars for Cavalcanti	274.0114131936383
The latter faithful to the principle of Horace nil admirari had contented himself with showing his knowledge by declaring in what lake the best lampreys were caught	704.0003006009838
Then he had eaten some without saying a word more Danglars therefore concluded that such luxuries were common at the table of the illustrious descendant of the Cavalcanti who most likely in Lucca fed upon trout brought from Switzerland and lobsters sent from England by the same means used by the count to bring the lampreys from Lake Fusaro and the sterlet from the Volga	215.90342573240306
Thus it was with much politeness of manner that he heard Cavalcanti pronounce these words	186.6314701617192
Tomorrow sir I shall have the honor of waiting upon you on business	59.37447729340829
And I sir said Danglars shall be most happy to receive you	57.299552113414194
Upon which he offered to take Cavalcanti in his carriage to the Htel des Princes if it would not be depriving him of the company of his son	42.98281389933189
To this Cavalcanti replied by saying that for some time past his son had lived independently of him that he had his own horses and carriages and that not having come together it would not be difficult for them to leave separately	125.50188888867089
The major seated himself therefore by the side of Danglars who was more and more charmed with the ideas of order and economy which ruled this man and yet who being able to allow his son 60000 francs a year might be supposed to possess a fortune of 500000 or 600000 livres	75.18852194822333
As for Andrea he began by way of showing off to scold his groom who instead of bringing the tilbury to the steps of the house had taken it to the outer door thus giving him the trouble of walking thirty steps to reach it	92.94805356973569
The groom heard him with humility took the bit of the impatient animal with his left hand and with the right held out the reins to Andrea who taking them from him rested his polished boot lightly on the step	100.94284604083424
At that moment a hand touched his shoulder	92.7228453067469
The young man turned round thinking that Danglars or Monte Cristo had forgotten something they wished to tell him and had returned just as they were starting	83.39224942165988
But instead of either of these he saw nothing but a strange face sunburnt and encircled by a beard with eyes brilliant as carbuncles and a smile upon the mouth which displayed a perfect set of white teeth pointed and sharp as the wolfs or jackals	255.34756848729165
A red handkerchief encircled his gray head torn and filthy garments covered his large bony limbs which seemed as though like those of a skeleton they would rattle as he walked and the hand with which he leaned upon the young mans shoulder and which was the first thing Andrea saw seemed of gigantic size	106.57767337694867
Did the young man recognize that face by the light of the lantern in his tilbury or was he merely struck with the horrible appearance of his interrogator We can not say but only relate the fact that he shuddered and stepped back suddenly	110.45930670332216
What do you want of me he asked	20.00377599484616
Pardon me my friend if I disturb you said the man with the red handkerchief but I want to speak to you	26.006526488659354
You have no right to beg at night said the groom endeavoring to rid his master of the troublesome intruder	222.0555018469963
I am not begging my fine fellow said the unknown to the servant with so ironical an expression of the eye and so frightful a smile that he withdrew I only wish to say two or three words to your master who gave me a commission to execute about a fortnight ago	74.48644936789444
Come said Andrea with sufficient nerve for his servant not to perceive his agitation what do you want Speak quickly friend	228.64222039527246
The man said in a low voice I wishI wish you to spare me the walk back to Paris	49.364386196843384
I am very tired and as I have not eaten so good a dinner as you I can scarcely stand	85.20425518081056
The young man shuddered at this strange familiarity	359.64129066452364
Tell me he saidtell me what you want	42.78162811711876
Well then I want you to take me up in your fine carriage and carry me back	58.567607291248
Andrea turned pale but said nothing	262.6403281078475
Yes said the man thrusting his hands into his pockets and looking impudently at the youth I have taken the whim into my head do you understand Master Benedetto	110.83900323492004
At this name no doubt the young man reflected a little for he went towards his groom saying	83.84097008896252
This man is right I did indeed charge him with a commission the result of which he must tell me walk to the barrier there take a cab that you may not be too late	66.59235293319111
Let me at least reach a shady spot said Andrea	151.80373834543533
Oh as for that Ill take you to a splendid place said the man with the handkerchief and taking the horses bit he led the tilbury where it was certainly impossible for anyone to witness the honor that Andrea conferred upon him	78.68327720982035
Do nt think I want the glory of riding in your fine carriage said he oh no its only because I am tired and also because I have a little business to talk over with you	101.76559873003356
Come step in said the young man	3.53382025929957
It was a pity this scene had not occurred in daylight for it was curious to see this rascal throwing himself heavily down on the cushion beside the young and elegant driver of the tilbury	131.17932308538926
Andrea drove past the last house in the village without saying a word to his companion who smiled complacently as though wellpleased to find himself travelling in so comfortable a vehicle	129.01358211542234
Once out of Auteuil Andrea looked around in order to assure himself that he could neither be seen nor heard and then stopping the horse and crossing his arms before the man he asked	52.04292009543009
Now tell me why you come to disturb my tranquillity	129.63589979576057
Let me ask you why you deceived me	21.219929478001035
How do you ask When we parted at the Pont du Var you told me you were going to travel through Piedmont and Tuscany but instead of that you come to Paris	87.40751782910908
It does not on the contrary I think it will answer my purpose	44.51755920645562
So said Andrea you are speculating upon me	406.0509431717478
I warn you Master Caderousse that you are mistaken	16.33522979976837
Well well do nt be angry my boy you know well enough what it is to be unfortunate and misfortunes make us jealous	148.83395129451358
I thought you were earning a living in Tuscany or Piedmont by acting as facchino or cicerone and I pitied you sincerely as I would a child of my own	215.18958333331616
You know I always did call you my child	42.95067324270847
I am patient but go on	62.929105386824965
All at once I see you pass through the barrier with a groom a tilbury and fine new clothes	122.76148489215328
You must have discovered a mine or else become a stockbroker	1178.2299654372832
So that as you confess you are jealous	65.18779901788058
No I am pleasedso pleased that I wished to congratulate you but as I am not quite properly dressed I chose my opportunity that I might not compromise you	91.45375570666539
Yes and a fine opportunity you have chosen exclaimed Andrea you speak to me before my servant	61.89183130887985
How can I help that my boy I speak to you when I can catch you	46.684954599693896
You have a quick horse a light tilbury you are naturally as slippery as an eel if I had missed you tonight I might not have had another chance	190.9157444290238
You see I do not conceal myself	290.76042801671656
You are lucky I wish I could say as much for I do conceal myself and then I was afraid you would not recognize me but you did added Caderousse with his unpleasant smile	58.98459620308165
It was very polite of you	77.07566468872817
Come said Andrea what do you want	3.6488296003536895
You do not speak affectionately to me Benedetto my old friend that is not righttake care or I may become troublesome	196.15296957912923
This menace smothered the young mans passion	282.2590442329533
He urged the horse again into a trot	242.3622370989782
You should not speak so to an old friend like me Caderousse as you said just now you are a native of Marseilles I am	53.13176649294975
Do you know then now what you are	21.05937349071658
No but I was brought up in Corsica you are old and obstinate I am young and wilful	160.87226721221484
Between people like us threats are out of place everything should be amicably arranged	266.460933480921
Is it my fault if fortune which has frowned on you has been kind to me	95.34027994716917
Fortune has been kind to you then Your tilbury your groom your clothes are not then hired Good so much the better said Caderousse his eyes sparkling with avarice	219.28624503033387
Oh you knew that well enough before speaking to me said Andrea becoming more and more excited	101.93860436091838
If I had been wearing a handkerchief like yours on my head rags on my back and wornout shoes on my feet you would not have known me	121.54422355494289
You wrong me my boy now I have found you nothing prevents my being as welldressed as anyone knowing as I do the goodness of your heart	104.99590216427887
If you have two coats you will give me one of them	14.786629044435026
I used to divide my soup and beans with you when you were hungry	140.38329761239035
What an appetite you used to have Is it as good now	63.29670640189878
How did you come to be dining with that prince whose house you have just left	91.22230338398319
He is not a prince simply a count	269.2909230547424
A count and a rich one too eh	518.3694619176358
Yes but you had better not have anything to say to him for he is not a very goodtempered gentleman	64.63541993340282
Oh be easy I have no design upon your count and you shall have him all to yourself	93.15437412911643
But said Caderousse again smiling with the disagreeable expression he had before assumed you must pay for ityou understand	181.26373432518898
I think that with a hundred francs a month	24.008845664809357
Comeyou understand me but that with	980.1936446956538
With a hundred and fifty francs I should be quite happy	28.183502595302986
Here are two hundred said Andrea and he placed ten gold louis in the hand of Caderousse	117.83896077386952
Apply to the steward on the first day of every month and you will receive the same sum	28.61564326897148
There now again you degrade me	2.6877870892375224
By making me apply to the servants when I want to transact business with you alone	129.9150175113844
Take it from me then and so long at least as I receive my income you shall be paid yours	63.43474641215929
Come come I always said you were a fine fellow and it is a blessing when good fortune happens to such as you	88.10352575390066
But tell me all about it	5.829458965971716
Why do you wish to know asked Cavalcanti	201.81564035872776
What do you again defy me	7.5363318735172244
No the fact is I have found my father	33.23646529541116
Yes so long as he pays me	567.8550176921677
You ll honor and believe himthats right	16605.00904705498
So far I have appeared to answer his purpose	130.1241154217094
And who found this father for you	38.09606399367455
The man whose house you have just left	17.61170488907143
I wish you would try and find me a situation with him as grandfather since he holds the moneychest	213.46957380484145
Well I will mention you to him	39.73945157278209
Meanwhile what are you going to do	3.6588172616954964
It is very kind of you to trouble yourself about me	162.74250134590963
Since you interest yourself in my affairs I think it is now my turn to ask you some questions	37.8311259752478
Well I shall rent a room in some respectable house wear a decent coat shave every day and go and read the papers in a caf	341.2802191728847
Then in the evening I shall go to the theatre I shall look like some retired baker	86.0955988462155
Come if you will only put this scheme into execution and be steady nothing could be better	191.28413500474932
Bossuet And youwhat will you become A peer of France	90.37070667186744
Major Cavalcanti is already one perhaps but then hereditary rank is abolished	2338.4872036922275
And now that you have all you want and that we understand each other jump down from the tilbury and disappear	92.88553734344839
Not at all my good friend	32.43789057960166
Why just think for a moment with this red handkerchief on my head with scarcely any shoes no papers and ten gold napoleons in my pocket without reckoning what was there beforemaking in all about two hundred francswhy I should certainly be arrested at the barriers	235.3926344689265
Then to justify myself I should say that you gave me the money this would cause inquiries it would be found that I left Toulon without giving due notice and I should then be escorted back to the shores of the Mediterranean	114.71553128724992
Then I should become simply No	856.1856064625957
106 and goodbye to my dream of resembling the retired baker No no my boy I prefer remaining honorably in the capital	485.6719779023557
Certainly as he had himself owned the reputed son of Major Cavalcanti was a wilful fellow	197.98370556834044
He drew up for a minute threw a rapid glance around him and then his hand fell instantly into his pocket where it began playing with a pistol	55.46121018893917
But meanwhile Caderousse who had never taken his eyes off his companion passed his hand behind his back and opened a long Spanish knife which he always carried with him to be ready in case of need	70.11777062492571
The two friends as we see were worthy of and understood one another	177.57177943271734
Andreas hand left his pocket inoffensively and was carried up to the red moustache which it played with for some time	90.99337019289956
Good Caderousse he said how happy you will be	23.230714365633137
I will do my best said the innkeeper of the Pont du Gard shutting up his knife	35.09412053738371
Well then we will go into Paris	12.285270645086092
But how will you pass through the barrier without exciting suspicion It seems to me that you are in more danger riding than on foot	137.46789233501767
Wait said Caderousse we shall see	22.77793410530467
He then took the greatcoat with the large collar which the groom had left behind in the tilbury and put it on his back then he took off Cavalcantis hat which he placed upon his own head and finally he assumed the careless attitude of a servant whose master drives himself	70.02336990615161
But tell me said Andrea am I to remain bareheaded	219.72046690254712
Pooh said Caderousse it is so windy that your hat can easily appear to have blown off	175.2924837616246
Come come enough of this said Cavalcanti	263.86057970638666
What are you waiting for said Caderousse	114.64229002446174
I hope I am not the cause	68.81731095996669
They passed the barrier without accident	897.5285649084481
At the first cross street Andrea stopped his horse and Caderousse leaped out	73.86172023572763
Well said Andreamy servants coat and my hat	75.40702004540245
Ah said Caderousse you would not like me to risk taking cold	234.6036416157481
But what am I to do	11.001605847959185
You Oh you are young while I am beginning to get old	208.73860717005496
Au revoir Benedetto and running into a court he disappeared	44.344820137107654
Alas said Andrea sighing one can not be completely happy in this world	38.592443283237984
the three young people separatedthat is to say Morrel went to the Boulevards ChteauRenaud to the Pont de la Rvolution and Debray to the Quai	75.55679238538791
Most probably Morrel and ChteauRenaud returned to their domestic hearths as they say in the gallery of the Chamber in wellturned speeches and in the theatre of the Rue Richelieu in wellwritten pieces but it was not the case with Debray	98.3473005976818
When he reached the wicket of the Louvre he turned to the left galloped across the Carrousel passed through the Rue SaintRoch and issuing from the Rue de la Michodire he arrived at M	63.82464298208553
Danglars door just at the same time that Villeforts landau after having deposited him and his wife at the Faubourg SaintHonor stopped to leave the baroness at her own house	74.36802314053057
Debray with the air of a man familiar with the house entered first into the court threw his bridle into the hands of a footman and returned to the door to receive Madame Danglars to whom he offered his arm to conduct her to her apartments	35.322234271212196
The gate once closed and Debray and the baroness alone in the court he asked	49.91576515529884
What was the matter with you Hermine and why were you so affected at that story or rather fable which the count related	198.99455891036558
Because I have been in such shocking spirits all the evening my friend said the baroness	100.49654320089216
No Hermine replied Debray you can not make me believe that on the contrary you were in excellent spirits when you arrived at the counts	43.3276822692788
Danglars was disagreeable certainly but I know how much you care for his illhumor	91.40816358620847
Someone has vexed you I will allow no one to annoy you	51.46546166491062
You are deceived Lucien I assure you replied Madame Danglars and what I have told you is really the case added to the illhumor you remarked but which I did not think it worth while to allude to	66.45916392164315
It was evident that Madame Danglars was suffering from that nervous irritability which women frequently can not account for even to themselves or that as Debray had guessed she had experienced some secret agitation that she would not acknowledge to anyone	189.7437763940832
Being a man who knew that the former of these symptoms was one of the inherent penalties of womanhood he did not then press his inquiries but waited for a more appropriate opportunity when he should again interrogate her or receive an avowal proprio motu	292.405723889169
At the door of her apartment the baroness met Mademoiselle Cornlie her confidential maid	379.43455535120705
What is my daughter doing asked Madame Danglars	11.547846968377941
She practiced all the evening and then went to bed replied Mademoiselle Cornlie	188.40709252440965
Yet I think I hear her piano	856.4800133295532
It is Mademoiselle Louise dArmilly who is playing while Mademoiselle Danglars is in bed	69.81520120666828
Well said Madame Danglars come and undress me	254.03605905358324
Debray stretched himself upon a large couch and Madame Danglars passed into her dressingroom with Mademoiselle Cornlie	97.50412857907054
Lucien said Madame Danglars through the door you are always complaining that Eugnie will not address a word to you	62.52056604746484
Madame said Lucien playing with a little dog who recognizing him as a friend of the house expected to be caressed I am not the only one who makes similar complaints I think I heard Morcerf say that he could not extract a word from his betrothed	87.26120920478316
True said Madame Danglars yet I think this will all pass off and that you will one day see her enter your study	81.51362795921884
At least that of the minister	2076.991413328285
To ask for an engagement at the Opera	14.331063470226496
Really I never saw such an infatuation for music it is quite ridiculous for a young lady of fashion	141.19852561904776
Well said he let her come with your consent and that of the baron and we will try and give her an engagement though we are very poor to pay such talent as hers	90.63650138810233
Go Cornlie said Madame Danglars I do not require you any longer	14.7963869854487
Cornlie obeyed and the next minute Madame Danglars left her room in a charming loose dress and came and sat down close to Debray	61.539071302603425
Then she began thoughtfully to caress the little spaniel	1623.0889739451536
Lucien looked at her for a moment in silence	26.130002447597047
Come Hermine he said after a short time answer candidlysomething vexes youis it not so	884.0514178079943
And yet as she could scarcely breathe she rose and went towards a lookingglass	158.87261496892265
I am frightful tonight she said	15.405153715583316
Debray rose smiling and was about to contradict the baroness upon this latter point when the door opened suddenly	90.02311013124528
At the noise of the door Madame Danglars turned round and looked upon her husband with an astonishment she took no trouble to conceal	60.82527238455356
Goodevening madame said the banker goodevening M	8329.65568695457
Probably the baroness thought this unexpected visit signified a desire to make up for the sharp words he had uttered during the day	107.8369873042526
Assuming a dignified air she turned round to Debray without answering her husband	92.5197191947408
Debray who was slightly disturbed at this visit recovered himself when he saw the calmness of the baroness and took up a book marked by a motherofpearl knife inlaid with gold	106.353711004457
Excuse me said the banker but you will tire yourself baroness by such late hours and M	212.58540359657053
Debray lives some distance from here	384.11080752890007
Debray was petrified not only to hear Danglars speak so calmly and politely but because it was apparent that beneath outward politeness there really lurked a determined spirit of opposition to anything his wife might wish to do	365.177240386781
The baroness was also surprised and showed her astonishment by a look which would doubtless have had some effect upon her husband if he had not been intently occupied with the paper where he was looking to see the closing stock quotations	98.24196761132528
The result was that the proud look entirely failed of its purpose	603.1689421756844
Lucien said the baroness I assure you I have no desire to sleep and that I have a thousand things to tell you this evening which you must listen to even though you slept while hearing me	54.774635354028796
I am at your service madame replied Lucien coldly	146.3687736307984
Debray said the banker do not kill yourself tonight listening to the follies of Madame Danglars for you can hear them as well tomorrow but I claim tonight and will devote it if you will allow me to talk over some serious matters with my wife	102.69433067588383
This time the blow was so well aimed and hit so directly that Lucien and the baroness were staggered and they interrogated each other with their eyes as if to seek help against this aggression but the irresistible will of the master of the house prevailed and the husband was victorious	160.87584210206467
Do not think I wish to turn you out my dear Debray continued Danglars oh no not at all	54.76403347499137
An unexpected occurrence forces me to ask my wife to have a little conversation with me it is so rarely I make such a request I am sure you can not grudge it to me	54.28021639864807
Debray muttered something bowed and went out knocking himself against the edge of the door like Nathan in Athalie	197.44502656640265
It is extraordinary he said when the door was closed behind him how easily these husbands whom we ridicule gain an advantage over us	214.56456238948465
Lucien having left Danglars took his place on the sofa closed the open book and placing himself in a dreadfully dictatorial attitude he began playing with the dog but the animal not liking him as well as Debray and attempting to bite him Danglars seized him by the skin of his neck and threw him upon a couch on the other side of the room	63.10553716356676
The animal uttered a cry during the transit but arrived at its destination it crouched behind the cushions and stupefied at such unusual treatment remained silent and motionless	253.54998186610698
Do you know sir asked the baroness that you are improving Generally you are only rude but tonight you are brutal	156.90402728147006
It is because I am in a worse humor than usual replied Danglars	147.05171347408302
Hermine looked at the banker with supreme disdain	369.177255826659
These glances frequently exasperated the pride of Danglars but this evening he took no notice of them	53.781558496573986
And what have I to do with your illhumor said the baroness irritated at the impassibility of her husband do these things concern me Keep your illhumor at home in your money boxes or since you have clerks whom you pay vent it upon them	142.00814425742686
Not so replied Danglars your advice is wrong so I shall not follow it	72.71663712387833
My money boxes are my Pactolus as I think M	253.15504754949697
Demoustier says and I will not retard its course or disturb its calm	614.0266752759155
My clerks are honest men who earn my fortune whom I pay much below their deserts if I may value them according to what they bring in therefore I shall not get into a passion with them those with whom I will be in a passion are those who eat my dinners mount my horses and exhaust my fortune	188.987271497736
And pray who are the persons who exhaust your fortune Explain yourself more clearly I beg sir	309.69246029621354
Oh make yourself easyI am not speaking riddles and you will soon know what I mean	52.579857273121995
The people who exhaust my fortune are those who draw out 700000 francs in the course of an hour	55.94106809998063
I do not understand you sir said the baroness trying to disguise the agitation of her voice and the flush of her face	37.90152195161877
You understand me perfectly on the contrary said Danglars but if you will persist I will tell you that I have just lost 700000 francs upon the Spanish loan	42.62292823208126
And pray asked the baroness am I responsible for this loss	167.2266828604353
Is it my fault you have lost 700000 francs	48.58934290696544
Once for all sir replied the baroness sharply I tell you I will not hear cash named it is a style of language I never heard in the house of my parents or in that of my first husband	91.1088216164657
Oh I can well believe that for neither of them was worth a penny	194.16940725394392
The better reason for my not being conversant with the slang of the bank which is here dinning in my ears from morning to night that noise of jingling crowns which are constantly being counted and recounted is odious to me	337.07536779003055
I only know one thing I dislike more which is the sound of your voice	145.97325207014325
Well this surprises me for I thought you took the liveliest interest in all my affairs	153.53309528836806
I What could put such an idea into your head	43.767179942500356
I should like to know upon what occasion	585.8240780128156
Oh mon Dieu that is very easily done	96.19575877915823
Last February you were the first who told me of the Haitian funds	92.78734742295545
You had dreamed that a ship had entered the harbor at Le Havre that this ship brought news that a payment we had looked upon as lost was going to be made	182.49966947786916
I know how clearsighted your dreams are I therefore purchased immediately as many shares as I could of the Haitian debt and I gained 400000 francs by it of which 100000 have been honestly paid to you	208.74497373205278
You spent it as you pleased that was your business	321.1401316029149
In March there was a question about a grant to a railway	148.77602979367916
Three companies presented themselves each offering equal securities	14476.554780543865
You told me that your instinctand although you pretend to know nothing about speculations I think on the contrary that your comprehension is very clear upon certain affairswell you told me that your instinct led you to believe the grant would be given to the company called the Southern	188.28767396431215
I bought two thirds of the shares of that company as you had foreseen the shares trebled in value and I picked up a million from which 250000 francs were paid to you for pinmoney	180.57669432544355
How have you spent this 250000 francsit is no business of mine	407.7209490544315
When are you coming to the point cried the baroness shivering with anger and impatience	120.53181701648145
Patience madame I am coming to it	33.21931186920385
In April you went to dine at the ministers	102.25793727716805
You heard a private conversation respecting Spanish affairson the expulsion of Don Carlos	1387.1122968128411
The expulsion took place and I pocketed 600000 francs the day Charles V	1567.6648100692532
Of these 600000 francs you took 50000 crowns	591.537594202865
They were yours you disposed of them according to your fancy and I asked no questions but it is not the less true that you have this year received 500000 livres	71.0889072740532
Ah yes it was just after this that you spoiled everything	683.01837475119
It expresses my meaning and that is all I want	25.51129131869725
Well three days after that you talked politics with M	206.11457967612418
Debray and you fancied from his words that Don Carlos had returned to Spain	130.18165267952494
Well I sold my shares the news got out and I no longer soldI gave them away next day I find the news was false and by this false report I have lost 700000 francs	121.78738787170444
Well since I gave you a fourth of my gains I think you owe me a fourth of my losses the fourth of 700000 francs is 175000 francs	116.46942565551002
What you say is absurd and I can not see why M	26.300865725443817
Debrays name is mixed up in this affair	23.263178884623358
Because if you do not possess the 175000 francs I reclaim you must have lent them to your friends and M	92.24633513557316
Debray is one of your friends	18.741487347488487
Oh let us have no gestures no screams no modern drama or you will oblige me to tell you that I see Debray leave here pocketing the whole of the 500000 livres you have handed over to him this year while he smiles to himself saying that he has found what the most skilful players have never discoveredthat is a roulette where he wins without playing and is no loser when he loses	226.04655232723383
Wretch she cried will you dare to tell me you did not know what you now reproach me with	31.75535875366766
I do not say that I did know it and I do not say that I did not know it	17.17234203557938
I merely tell you to look into my conduct during the last four years that we have ceased to be husband and wife and see whether it has not always been consistent	78.21206848620078
Some time after our rupture you wished to study music under the celebrated baritone who made such a successful appearance at the Thtre Italien at the same time I felt inclined to learn dancing of the danseuse who acquired such a reputation in London	202.21016264285925
This cost me on your account and mine 100000 francs	98.7635206430917
I said nothing for we must have peace in the house and 100000 francs for a lady and gentleman to be properly instructed in music and dancing are not too much	130.26573468845973
Well you soon become tired of singing and you take a fancy to study diplomacy with the ministers secretary	198.5435214412824
You understand it signifies nothing to me so long as you pay for your lessons out of your own cash box	103.33711285693158
But today I find you are drawing on mine and that your apprenticeship may cost me 700000 francs per month	122.16390434534331
Stop there madame for this can not last	242.3673606376708
Either the diplomatist must give his lessons gratis and I will tolerate him or he must never set his foot again in my housedo you understand madame	323.37271714222715
Oh this is too much cried Hermine choking you are worse than despicable	715.2363379555924
But continued Danglars I find you did not even pause there	120.18924909900083
You are right let us leave these facts alone and reason coolly	699.1490730114323
I have never interfered in your affairs excepting for your good treat me in the same way	60.11367191799768
You say you have nothing to do with my cash box	87.27671007805364
Do as you like with your own but do not fill or empty mine	159.1264451042861
Besides how do I know that this was not a political trick that the minister enraged at seeing me in the opposition and jealous of the popular sympathy I excite has not concerted with M	255.44739887110606
Why not Who ever heard of such an occurrence as thisa false telegraphic despatchit is almost impossible for wrong signals to be made as they were in the last two telegrams	321.6355930086744
It was done on purpose for meI am sure of it	37.733196536320584
Sir said the baroness humbly are you not aware that the man employed there was dismissed that they talked of going to law with him that orders were issued to arrest him and that this order would have been put into execution if he had not escaped by flight which proves that he was either mad or guilty It was a mistake	97.777738995143
Yes which made fools laugh which caused the minister to have a sleepless night which has caused the ministers secretaries to blacken several sheets of paper but which has cost me 700000 francs	177.46308026664968
But sir said Hermine suddenly if all this is as you say caused by M	120.15355580384502
Debray why instead of going direct to him do you come and tell me of it Why to accuse the man do you address the woman	81.3415109559859
Debraydo I wish to know himdo I wish to know that he gives advicedo I wish to follow itdo I speculate No you do all this not I	264.72959062721617
Still it seems to me that as you profit by it	198.2267907846169
Women fancy they have talent because they have managed two or three intrigues without being the talk of Paris But know that if you had even hidden your irregularities from your husband who has but the commencement of the artfor generally husbands will not seeyou would then have been but a faint imitation of most of your friends among the women of the world	154.07181056472623
But it has not been so with meI see and always have seen during the last sixteen years	97.91910387047612
You may perhaps have hidden a thought but not a step not an action not a fault has escaped me while you flattered yourself upon your address and firmly believed you had deceived me	137.23938158078187
What has been the resultthat thanks to my pretended ignorance there is none of your friends from M	117.45423473545317
Debray who has not trembled before me	26.543119617503237
There is not one who has not treated me as the master of the housethe only title I desire with respect to you there is not one in fact who would have dared to speak of me as I have spoken of them this day	63.983178649246206
I will allow you to make me hateful but I will prevent your rendering me ridiculous and above all I forbid you to ruin me	123.84906320483343
The baroness had been tolerably composed until the name of Villefort had been pronounced but then she became pale and rising as if touched by a spring she stretched out her hands as though conjuring an apparition she then took two or three steps towards her husband as though to tear the secret from him of which he was ignorant or which he withheld from some odious calculationodious as all his calculations were	100.85661106819572
de Nargonne your first husband being neither a philosopher nor a banker or perhaps being both and seeing there was nothing to be got out of a kings attorney died of grief or anger at finding after an absence of nine months that you had been enceinte six	129.46069500538704
I am brutalI not only allow it but boast of it it is one of the reasons of my success in commercial business	105.31488829203789
Why did he kill himself instead of you Because he had no cash to save	172.38718260269067
My life belongs to my cash	2169.3943210401094
Debray has made me lose 700000 francs let him bear his share of the loss and we will go on as before if not let him become bankrupt for the 250000 livres and do as all bankrupts dodisappear	200.17579173538346
He is a charming fellow I allow when his news is correct but when it is not there are fifty others in the world who would do better than he	88.10191483215752
Madame Danglars was rooted to the spot she made a violent effort to reply to this last attack but she fell upon a chair thinking of Villefort of the dinner scene of the strange series of misfortunes which had taken place in her house during the last few days and changed the usual calm of her establishment to a scene of scandalous debate	88.5112662003854
Danglars did not even look at her though she did her best to faint	126.7846273018604
He shut the bedroom door after him without adding another word and returned to his apartments and when Madame Danglars recovered from her halffainting condition she could almost believe that she had had a disagreeable dream	99.18722599750286
The day following this scene at the hour Debray usually chose to pay a visit to Madame Danglars on his way to his office his coup did not appear	51.33466237740608
At this time that is about halfpast twelve Madame Danglars ordered her carriage and went out	98.50327729431547
Danglars hidden behind a curtain watched the departure he had been waiting for	95.8352821366113
He gave orders that he should be informed as soon as Madame Danglars appeared but at two oclock she had not returned	39.57139680186822
He then called for his horses drove to the Chamber and inscribed his name to speak against the budget	116.61773530493709
From twelve to two oclock Danglars had remained in his study unsealing his dispatches and becoming more and more sad every minute heaping figure upon figure and receiving among other visits one from Major Cavalcanti who as stiff and exact as ever presented himself precisely at the hour named the night before to terminate his business with the banker	206.3734200670666
On leaving the Chamber Danglars who had shown violent marks of agitation during the sitting and been more bitter than ever against the ministry reentered his carriage and told the coachman to drive to the Avenue des Champslyses No	123.3333340792441
Monte Cristo was at home only he was engaged with someone and begged Danglars to wait for a moment in the drawingroom	53.1101592723397
While the banker was waiting in the anteroom the door opened and a man dressed as an abb and doubtless more familiar with the house than he was came in and instead of waiting merely bowed passed on to the farther apartments and disappeared	87.81516080546326
A minute after the door by which the priest had entered reopened and Monte Cristo appeared	65.70240481363267
Pardon me said he my dear baron but one of my friends the Abb Busoni whom you perhaps saw pass by has just arrived in Paris not having seen him for a long time I could not make up my mind to leave him sooner so I hope this will be sufficient reason for my having made you wait	55.07899225982032
Nay said Danglars it is my fault I have chosen my visit at a wrong time and will retire	88.41312028223328
Not at all on the contrary be seated but what is the matter with you You look careworn really you alarm me	168.56073065098423
Melancholy in a capitalist like the appearance of a comet presages some misfortune to the world	131.58102155256177
I have been in illluck for several days said Danglars and I have heard nothing but bad news	49.128223275200426
Have you had another fall at the Bourse	80.55666727305871
No I am safe for a few days at least	33.666354206786934
I am only annoyed about a bankrupt of Trieste	576.1679043931068
Really Does it happen to be Jacopo Manfredi	2173.199422360404
Imagine a man who has transacted business with me for I do nt know how long to the amount of 800000 or 900000 francs during the year	84.23288677898081
Never a mistake or delaya fellow who paid like a prince	179.9898211322459
Well I was a million in advance with him and now my fine Jacopo Manfredi suspends payment	949.7201064899498
I draw upon him for 600000 francs my bills are returned unpaid and more than that I hold bills of exchange signed by him to the value of 400000 francs payable at his correspondents in Paris at the end of this month	98.85620083068534
I present them but my correspondent has disappeared	456.9803468705526
This with my Spanish affairs made a pretty end to the month	151.24682921202702
Then you really lost by that affair in Spain	248.713233239982
Yes only 700000 francs out of my cash boxnothing more	200.89682908968612
Why how could you make such a mistakesuch an old stager	666.7477594221521
Oh it is all my wifes fault	2283.9722632659555
She dreamed Don Carlos had returned to Spain she believes in dreams	287.5010251160507
It is magnetism she says and when she dreams a thing it is sure to happen she assures me	286.5653565691464
On this conviction I allow her to speculate she having her bank and her stockbroker she speculated and lost	423.41207284446176
It is true she speculates with her own money not mine nevertheless you can understand that when 700000 francs leave the wifes pocket the husband always finds it out	136.53925025763908
But do you mean to say you have not heard of this Why the thing has made a tremendous noise	89.06620434871635
Yes I heard it spoken of but I did not know the details and then no one can be more ignorant than I am of the affairs in the Bourse	50.721874905468404
IHow could I speculate when I already have so much trouble in regulating my income I should be obliged besides my steward to keep a clerk and a boy	132.0820602430373
But touching these Spanish affairs I think that the baroness did not dream the whole of the Don Carlos matter	111.83431185397492
The papers said something about it did they not	45.70994965417357
Inot the least in the world only I fancied that the honest Messager was an exception to the rule and that it only announced telegraphic despatches	281.1347065455204
Well that s what puzzles me replied Danglars the news of the return of Don Carlos was brought by telegraph	68.92159829327277
So that said Monte Cristo you have lost nearly 1700000 francs this month	105.82934851869025
Not nearly indeed that is exactly my loss	504.74802448558796
Diable said Monte Cristo compassionately it is a hard blow for a thirdrate fortune	186.9872064106139
Thirdrate said Danglars rather humble what do you mean by that	25.025121580166676
Certainly continued Monte Cristo I make three assortments in fortunefirstrate secondrate and thirdrate fortunes	2840.61239953959
I call those firstrate which are composed of treasures one possesses under ones hand such as mines lands and funded property in such states as France Austria and England provided these treasures and property form a total of about a hundred millions I call those secondrate fortunes that are gained by manufacturing enterprises jointstock companies viceroyalties and principalities not drawing more than 1500000 francs the whole forming a capital of about fifty millions finally I call those thirdrate fortunes which are composed of a fluctuating capital dependent upon the will of others or upon chances which a bankruptcy involves or a false telegram shakes such as banks speculations of the dayin fact all operations under the influence of greater or less mischances the whole bringing in a real or fictitious capital of about fifteen millions	512.6532799379854
I think this is about your position is it not	38.82280329199868
The result then of six more such months as this would be to reduce the thirdrate house to despair	313.7463877455373
Oh said Danglars becoming very pale how you are running on	55.21165996511217
Let us imagine seven such months continued Monte Cristo in the same tone	22.996427752008525
Tell me have you ever thought that seven times 1700000 francs make nearly twelve millions No you have notwell you are right for if you indulged in such reflections you would never risk your principal which is to the speculator what the skin is to civilized man	202.17106721350203
We have our clothes some more splendid than othersthis is our credit but when a man dies he has only his skin in the same way on retiring from business you have nothing but your real principal of about five or six millions at the most for thirdrate fortunes are never more than a fourth of what they appear to be like the locomotive on a railway the size of which is magnified by the smoke and steam surrounding it	148.60458661700406
Well out of the five or six millions which form your real capital you have just lost nearly two millions which must of course in the same degree diminish your credit and fictitious fortune to follow out my simile your skin has been opened by bleeding and this if repeated three or four times will cause deathso pay attention to it my dear Monsieur Danglars	183.53196550209344
Do you want money Do you wish me to lend you some	10.617165460237599
What a bad calculator you are exclaimed Danglars calling to his assistance all his philosophy and dissimulation	162.08682734051436
I have made money at the same time by speculations which have succeeded	69.72422028971631
I have made up the loss of blood by nutrition	427.5545075775147
I lost a battle in Spain I have been defeated in Trieste but my naval army in India will have taken some galleons and my Mexican pioneers will have discovered some mine	326.90646998299974
Very good very good But the wound remains and will reopen at the first loss	333.67349319445697
No for I am only embarked in certainties replied Danglars with the air of a mountebank sounding his own praises to involve me three governments must crumble to dust	426.550804356257
That there should be a famine	57659.913253100385
Recollect the seven fat and the seven lean kine	741.6595386141249
Or that the sea should become dry as in the days of Pharaoh and even then my vessels would become caravans	307.51594874689664
I congratulate you my dear M	17.576748313015468
Danglars said Monte Cristo I see I was deceived and that you belong to the class of secondrate fortunes	109.83702782008253
I think I may aspire to that honor said Danglars with a smile which reminded Monte Cristo of the sickly moons which bad artists are so fond of daubing into their pictures of ruins	123.76867658005364
But while we are speaking of business Danglars added pleased to find an opportunity of changing the subject tell me what I am to do for M	85.63374332039106
Give him money if he is recommended to you and the recommendation seems good	161.8298788354301
Excellent he presented himself this morning with a bond of 40000 francs payable at sight on you signed by Busoni and returned by you to me with your endorsementof course I immediately counted him over the forty banknotes	149.95470662091066
Monte Cristo nodded his head in token of assent	14.54133577705956
But that is not all continued Danglars he has opened an account with my house for his son	97.7380860553052
May I ask how much he allows the young man	88.3572187143381
I thought I was right in believing that Cavalcanti to be a stingy fellow	240.43741092574098
How can a young man live upon 5000 francs a month	83.78990293996611
But you understand that if the young man should want a few thousands more	139.2688090285889
Do not advance it the father will never repay it	160.3503496809811
You do not know these ultramontane millionaires they are regular misers	2435.3638351089594
And by whom were they recommended to you	118.19939668613324
Oh by the house of Fenzi one of the best in Florence	213.1751987791067
I do not mean to say you will lose but nevertheless mind you hold to the terms of the agreement	123.86453630804866
Would you not trust the Cavalcanti	3494.111693447112
I oh I would advance ten millions on his signature	74.83882711805897
I was only speaking in reference to the secondrate fortunes we were mentioning just now	491.6579814890401
And with all this how unassuming he is I should never have taken him for anything more than a mere major	86.27079704358653
And you would have flattered him for certainly as you say he has no manner	85.95227620658066
The first time I saw him he appeared to me like an old lieutenant who had grown mouldy under his epaulets	121.07639189049253
But all the Italians are the same they are like old Jews when they are not glittering in Oriental splendor	282.5511221863535
The young man is better said Danglars	20.907759609243325
Yes a little nervous perhaps but upon the whole he appeared tolerable	328.9745673784397
Because you met him at my house just after his introduction into the world as they told me	46.61848804554073
He has been travelling with a very severe tutor and had never been to Paris before	78.3036670451611
Ah I believe noblemen marry amongst themselves do they not asked Danglars carelessly they like to unite their fortunes	242.57361930743502
It is usual certainly but Cavalcanti is an original who does nothing like other people	205.68821221320752
I can not help thinking that he has brought his son to France to choose a wife	68.22600826980766
And you have heard his fortune mentioned	262.9378083006501
Nothing else was talked of only some said he was worth millions and others that he did not possess a farthing	204.62873283910784
I ought not to influence you because it is only my own personal impression	103.85435756611417
My opinion is that all these old podests these ancient condottierifor the Cavalcanti have commanded armies and governed provincesmy opinion I say is that they have buried their millions in corners the secret of which they have transmitted only to their eldest sons who have done the same from generation to generation and the proof of this is seen in their yellow and dry appearance like the florins of the republic which from being constantly gazed upon have become reflected in them	284.7667438473285
Certainly said Danglars and this is further supported by the fact of their not possessing an inch of land	145.38683481788166
Very little at least I know of none which Cavalcanti possesses excepting his palace in Lucca	569.9876249806969
Ah he has a palace said Danglars laughing come that is something	166.33317035931756
Yes and more than that he lets it to the Minister of Finance while he lives in a simple house	156.90051533256084
Oh as I told you before I think the old fellow is very close	120.43240573854968
Come you do not flatter him	28.8175290215064
I scarcely know him I think I have seen him three times in my life all I know relating to him is through Busoni and himself	86.80449948526412
He was telling me this morning that tired of letting his property lie dormant in Italy which is a dead nation he wished to find a method either in France or England of multiplying his millions but remember that though I place great confidence in Busoni I am not responsible for this	225.31135709866987
Never mind accept my thanks for the client you have sent me	47.84411100061136
It is a fine name to inscribe on my ledgers and my cashier was quite proud of it when I explained to him who the Cavalcanti were	138.1944898938802
By the way this is merely a simple question when this sort of people marry their sons do they give them any fortune	224.53403092479573
I know an Italian prince rich as a gold mine one of the noblest families in Tuscany who when his sons married according to his wish gave them millions and when they married against his consent merely allowed them thirty crowns a month	209.88222205317925
Should Andrea marry according to his fathers views he will perhaps give him one two or three millions	86.602730454394
For example supposing it were the daughter of a banker he might take an interest in the house of the fatherinlaw of his son then again if he disliked his choice the major takes the key doublelocks his coffer and Master Andrea would be obliged to live like the sons of a Parisian family by shuffling cards or rattling the dice	145.8344543619613
Ah that boy will find out some Bavarian or Peruvian princess he will want a crown an El Dorado and Potos	718.7269829374933
No these grand lords on the other side of the Alps frequently marry into plain families like Jupiter they like to cross the race	273.77042661998365
But do you wish to marry Andrea my dear M	49.85939354685139
Danglars that you are asking so many questions	45.24440213589617
Ma foi said Danglars it would not be a bad speculation I fancy and you know I am a speculator	65.74784047919411
You are not thinking of Mademoiselle Danglars I hope you would not like poor Andrea to have his throat cut by Albert	117.55883089388706
Albert repeated Danglars shrugging his shoulders ah well he would care very little about it I think	99.44400601344789
But he is betrothed to your daughter I believe	42.55674404176252
de Morcerf and I have talked about this marriage but Madame de Morcerf and Albert	95.44307247876802
You do not mean to say that it would not be a good match	25.244925162198683
Indeed I imagine that Mademoiselle Danglars is as good as M	19.232564363438776
Mademoiselle Danglars fortune will be great no doubt especially if the telegraph should not make any more mistakes	162.91935408016573
Oh I do not mean her fortune only but tell me	157.04178535637303
Why did you not invite M	67.22703837502064
and Madame de Morcerf to your dinner	529.5514638140339
I did so but he excused himself on account of Madame de Morcerf being obliged to go to Dieppe for the benefit of sea air	137.41812170289793
Yes yes said Danglars laughing it would do her a great deal of good	110.42616202737972
Because it is the air she always breathed in her youth	145.30768563612432
Monte Cristo took no notice of this illnatured remark	531.3093815381043
But still if Albert be not so rich as Mademoiselle Danglars said the count you must allow that he has a fine name	36.94253469738176
So he has but I like mine as well	201.82718065280426
Certainly your name is popular and does honor to the title they have adorned it with but you are too intelligent not to know that according to a prejudice too firmly rooted to be exterminated a nobility which dates back five centuries is worth more than one that can only reckon twenty years	228.33189545196268
And for this very reason said Danglars with a smile which he tried to make sardonic I prefer M	52.38808333166178
Still I should not think the Morcerfs would yield to the Cavalcanti	126.66031883379965
The MorcerfsStay my dear count said Danglars you are a man of the world are you not	16.231310509203833
Well look at my coatofarms it is worth more than Morcerfs	57.020538816074705
Because though I am not a baron by birth my real name is at least Danglars	135.4402351083637
While his name is not Morcerf	3279.4792085438417
Not the least in the world	8.22910271712621
I have been made a baron so that I actually am one he made himself a count so that he is not one at all	103.86320071505492
de Morcerf has been my friend or rather my acquaintance during the last thirty years	84.94725218783552
You know I have made the most of my arms though I never forgot my origin	121.78453230958922
A proof of great humility or great pride said Monte Cristo	47.08368369988214
Well when I was a clerk Morcerf was a mere fisherman	586.9643457867372
Pardieu I have bought enough fish of him to know his name	214.5303720167111
Then why did you think of giving your daughter to him	57.903120194719065
Because Fernand and Danglars being both parvenus both having become noble both rich are about equal in worth excepting that there have been certain things mentioned of him that were never said of me	325.09251458449154
Ah yes what you tell me recalls to mind something about the name of Fernand Mondego	173.4221175441054
I have heard that name in Greece	291.1087750593659
In conjunction with the affairs of Ali Pasha	8.857003141539575
This is the mystery said Danglars	21.94992480635379
I acknowledge I would have given anything to find it out	70.89266199299632
It would be very easy if you much wished it	146.18125249796466
Probably you have some correspondent in Greece	211.49715964726522
Well write to your correspondent in Yanina and ask him what part was played by a Frenchman named Fernand Mondego in the catastrophe of Ali Tepelini	91.20026852522852
You are right exclaimed Danglars rising quickly I will write today	120.45733786408884
And if you should hear of anything very scandalous	360.1082437446568
I will communicate it to you	5.196158771598311
Danglars rushed out of the room and made but one leap into his coup	97.30006958390679
The Office of the Kings Attorney	13673.72663040057
Let us leave the banker driving his horses at their fullest speed and follow Madame Danglars in her morning excursion	407.3068528319508
We have said that at halfpast twelve oclock Madame Danglars had ordered her horses and had left home in the carriage	53.815307008254216
She directed her course towards the Faubourg Saint Germain went down the Rue Mazarine and stopped at the Passage du PontNeuf	93.07433886431768
She descended and went through the passage	21.74536948051911
She was very plainly dressed as would be the case with a woman of taste walking in the morning	76.3740127507783
At the Rue Gungaud she called a cab and directed the driver to go to the Rue de Harlay	40.97926959780064
As soon as she was seated in the vehicle she drew from her pocket a very thick black veil which she tied on to her straw bonnet	57.881456652771845
She then replaced the bonnet and saw with pleasure in a little pocketmirror that her white complexion and brilliant eyes were alone visible	161.3425253217579
The cab crossed the PontNeuf and entered the Rue de Harlay by the Place Dauphine the driver was paid as the door opened and stepping lightly up the stairs Madame Danglars soon reached the Salle des PasPerdus	82.4910441306874
There was a great deal going on that morning and many businesslike persons at the Palais businesslike persons pay very little attention to women and Madame Danglars crossed the hall without exciting any more attention than any other woman calling upon her lawyer	256.97295401142145
There was a great press of people in M	81.57498075905936
de Villeforts antechamber but Madame Danglars had no occasion even to pronounce her name	62.5709139861266
The instant she appeared the doorkeeper rose came to her and asked her whether she was not the person with whom the procureur had made an appointment and on her affirmative answer being given he conducted her by a private passage to M	120.50965947998424
The magistrate was seated in an armchair writing with his back towards the door he did not move as he heard it open and the doorkeeper pronounce the words Walk in madame and then reclose it but no sooner had the mans footsteps ceased than he started up drew the bolts closed the curtains and examined every corner of the room	107.80505923313129
Then when he had assured himself that he could neither be seen nor heard and was consequently relieved of doubts he said	111.47146473406949
Thanks madamethanks for your punctuality and he offered a chair to Madame Danglars which she accepted for her heart beat so violently that she felt nearly suffocated	69.36466443882041
It is a long time madame said the procureur describing a halfcircle with his chair so as to place himself exactly opposite to Madame Danglarsit is a long time since I had the pleasure of speaking alone with you and I regret that we have only now met to enter upon a painful conversation	103.06681143149412
Nevertheless sir you see I have answered your first appeal although certainly the conversation must be much more painful for me than for you	184.45288122041907
It is true then he said rather uttering his thoughts aloud than addressing his companionit is true then that all our actions leave their tracessome sad others brighton our paths it is true that every step in our lives is like the course of an insect on the sandsit leaves its track Alas to many the path is traced by tears	319.2523698086041
Sir said Madame Danglars you can feel for my emotion can you not Spare me then I beseech you	78.34679102320483
When I look at this roomwhence so many guilty creatures have departed trembling and ashamed when I look at that chair before which I now sit trembling and ashamedoh it requires all my reason to convince me that I am not a very guilty woman and you a menacing judge	235.86916751274669
Villefort dropped his head and sighed	4453.401451427028
And I he said I feel that my place is not in the judges seat but on the prisoners bench	160.68936417414918
I think sir you exaggerate your situation said Madame Danglars whose beautiful eyes sparkled for a moment	36.21323500217885
The paths of which you were just speaking have been traced by all young men of ardent imaginations	142.04171794599262
Besides the pleasure there is always remorse from the indulgence of our passions and after all what have you men to fear from all this the world excuses and notoriety ennobles you	241.40846620714476
Madame replied Villefort you know that I am no hypocrite or at least that I never deceive without a reason	114.6769150424541
If my brow be severe it is because many misfortunes have clouded it if my heart be petrified it is that it might sustain the blows it has received	204.41696811157317
I was not so in my youth I was not so on the night of the betrothal when we were all seated around a table in the Rue du Cours at Marseilles	54.83260119307246
But since then everything has changed in and about me I am accustomed to brave difficulties and in the conflict to crush those who by their own free will or by chance voluntarily or involuntarily interfere with me in my career	193.13021447891222
It is generally the case that what we most ardently desire is as ardently withheld from us by those who wish to obtain it or from whom we attempt to snatch it	235.42128148773386
Thus the greater number of a mans errors come before him disguised under the specious form of necessity then after error has been committed in a moment of excitement of delirium or of fear we see that we might have avoided and escaped it	150.42143031924357
The means we might have used which we in our blindness could not see then seem simple and easy and we say Why did I not do this instead of that Women on the contrary are rarely tormented with remorse for the decision does not come from youyour misfortunes are generally imposed upon you and your faults the results of others crimes	181.91156491153058
In any case sir you will allow replied Madame Danglars that even if the fault were alone mine I last night received a severe punishment for it	203.17168487189778
Poor thing said Villefort pressing her hand it was too severe for your strength for you were twice overwhelmed and yet	60.17398816179854
Collect all your courage for you have not yet heard all	24.62108985606156
Ah exclaimed Madame Danglars alarmed what is there more to hear	55.747665705217315
You only look back to the past and it is indeed bad enough	56.960552376715825
Well picture to yourself a future more gloomy stillcertainly frightful perhaps sanguinary	3600.5659328425477
The baroness knew how calm Villefort naturally was and his present excitement frightened her so much that she opened her mouth to scream but the sound died in her throat	123.73256307398358
How has this terrible past been recalled cried Villefort how is it that it has escaped from the depths of the tomb and the recesses of our hearts where it was buried to visit us now like a phantom whitening our cheeks and flushing our brows with shame	122.46473561404014
Alas said Hermine doubtless it is chance	105.82515225762337
Chance replied Villefort No no madame there is no such thing as chance	81.94092353341985
Oh yes has not a fatal chance revealed all this Was it not by chance the Count of Monte Cristo bought that house Was it not by chance he caused the earth to be dug up Is it not by chance that the unfortunate child was disinterred under the treesthat poor innocent offspring of mine which I never even kissed but for whom I wept many many tears	137.8672526351808
Ah my heart clung to the count when he mentioned the dear spoil found beneath the flowers	249.18830147331786
Well no madamethis is the terrible news I have to tell you said Villefort in a hollow voiceno nothing was found beneath the flowers there was no child disinterredno	185.28581088552346
You must not weep no you must not groan you must tremble	157.45423710706993
What can you mean asked Madame Danglars shuddering	89.43998700377414
de Monte Cristo digging underneath these trees found neither skeleton nor chest because neither of them was there	507.55318912838413
Neither of them there repeated Madame Danglars her staring wideopen eyes expressing her alarm	220.42066043246166
Neither of them there she again said as though striving to impress herself with the meaning of the words which escaped her	119.50598020518238
No said Villefort burying his face in his hands no a hundred times no	55.91860129049695
Then you did not bury the poor child there sir Why did you deceive me Where did you place it tell mewhere	143.57297832338233
There But listen to melistenand you will pity me who has for twenty years alone borne the heavy burden of grief I am about to reveal without casting the least portion upon you	121.08272111525955
Oh you frighten me But speak I will listen	198.6858472451329
You recollect that sad night when you were halfexpiring on that bed in the red damask room while I scarcely less agitated than you awaited your delivery	144.11021714297704
The child was born was given to memotionless breathless voiceless we thought it dead	1071.8166233447025
Madame Danglars moved rapidly as though she would spring from her chair but Villefort stopped and clasped his hands as if to implore her attention	62.711491134538896
We thought it dead he repeated I placed it in the chest which was to take the place of a coffin I descended to the garden I dug a hole and then flung it down in haste	60.06615074988336
Scarcely had I covered it with earth when the arm of the Corsican was stretched towards me I saw a shadow rise and at the same time a flash of light	48.28442860383045
I felt pain I wished to cry out but an icy shiver ran through my veins and stifled my voice I fell lifeless and fancied myself killed	152.56553951437013
Never shall I forget your sublime courage when having returned to consciousness I dragged myself to the foot of the stairs and you almost dying yourself came to meet me	115.1477602724668
We were obliged to keep silent upon the dreadful catastrophe	520.6954834839806
You had the fortitude to regain the house assisted by your nurse	284.76206958200237
A duel was the pretext for my wound	221.00765369408006
Though we scarcely expected it our secret remained in our own keeping alone	159.72928244030004
I was taken to Versailles for three months I struggled with death at last as I seemed to cling to life I was ordered to the South	122.05667933170022
Four men carried me from Paris to Chlons walking six leagues a day Madame de Villefort followed the litter in her carriage	145.18936084460245
At Chlons I was put upon the Sane thence I passed on to the Rhne whence I descended merely with the current to Arles at Arles I was again placed on my litter and continued my journey to Marseilles	236.78760947751437
I never heard you mentioned and I did not dare inquire for you	49.30776467562475
When I returned to Paris I learned that you the widow of M	89.26721963121014
What was the subject of my thoughts from the time consciousness returned to me Always the samealways the childs corpse coming every night in my dreams rising from the earth and hovering over the grave with menacing look and gesture	251.0921876313169
I inquired immediately on my return to Paris the house had not been inhabited since we left it but it had just been let for nine years	56.67794144398795
I pretended that I disliked the idea that a house belonging to my wifes father and mother should pass into the hands of strangers	81.73838155764211
I offered to pay them for cancelling the lease they demanded 6000 francs	672.7512492747302
I would have given 10000I would have given 20000	471.0782567749106
I had the money with me I made the tenant sign the deed of resilition and when I had obtained what I so much wanted I galloped to Auteuil	208.24496979660444
No one had entered the house since I had left it	39.60499147231636
It was five oclock in the afternoon I ascended into the red room and waited for night	69.8823440790082
There all the thoughts which had disturbed me during my year of constant agony came back with double force	229.28550199506304
The Corsican who had declared the vendetta against me who had followed me from Nmes to Paris who had hid himself in the garden who had struck me had seen me dig the grave had seen me inter the childhe might become acquainted with your personnay he might even then have known it	159.37731906654696
Would he not one day make you pay for keeping this terrible secret Would it not be a sweet revenge for him when he found that I had not died from the blow of his dagger It was therefore necessary before everything else and at all risks that I should cause all traces of the past to disappearthat I should destroy every material vestige too much reality would always remain in my recollection	153.10607539828837
It was for this I had annulled the leaseit was for this I had comeit was for this I was waiting	314.0311354963635
Night arrived I allowed it to become quite dark	381.96050330326955
I was without a light in that room when the wind shook all the doors behind which I continually expected to see some spy concealed I trembled	105.15890617668536
I seemed everywhere to hear your moans behind me in the bed and I dared not turn around	111.99811855486979
My heart beat so violently that I feared my wound would open	192.15788818078948
At length one by one all the noises in the neighborhood ceased	233.88967965030946
I understood that I had nothing to fear that I should neither be seen nor heard so I decided upon descending to the garden	91.18924784094943
Listen Hermine I consider myself as brave as most men but when I drew from my breast the little key of the staircase which I had found in my coatthat little key we both used to cherish so much which you wished to have fastened to a golden ringwhen I opened the door and saw the pale moon shedding a long stream of white light on the spiral staircase like a spectre I leaned against the wall and nearly shrieked	107.20712280058
I seemed to be going mad	836.0681881745329
At last I mastered my agitation	1160.7125911315538
I descended the staircase step by step the only thing I could not conquer was a strange trembling in my knees	127.92571678155011
I grasped the railings if I had relaxed my hold for a moment I should have fallen	60.278158076490435
Outside this door a spade was placed against the wall I took it and advanced towards the thicket	52.493325249953415
I had provided myself with a dark lantern	84.24198647648082
In the middle of the lawn I stopped to light it then I continued my path	281.0052563242278
It was the end of November all the verdure of the garden had disappeared the trees were nothing more than skeletons with their long bony arms and the dead leaves sounded on the gravel under my feet	111.72838809262383
My terror overcame me to such a degree as I approached the thicket that I took a pistol from my pocket and armed myself	94.58821195601173
I fancied continually that I saw the figure of the Corsican between the branches	88.27854637580003
I examined the thicket with my dark lantern it was empty	114.0597970985641
I looked carefully around I was indeed aloneno noise disturbed the silence but the owl whose piercing cry seemed to be calling up the phantoms of the night	171.2754058847269
I tied my lantern to a forked branch I had noticed a year before at the precise spot where I stopped to dig the hole	133.18262282846203
The grass had grown very thickly there during the summer and when autumn arrived no one had been there to mow it	308.7883464258015
Still one place where the grass was thin attracted my attention it evidently was there I had turned up the ground	230.75470900833528
The hour then for which I had been waiting during the last year had at length arrived	31.825321734459774
How I worked how I hoped how I struck every piece of turf thinking to find some resistance to my spade But no I found nothing though I had made a hole twice as large as the first	159.79547490171623
I thought I had been deceivedhad mistaken the spot	3799.8297574386793
I turned around I looked at the trees I tried to recall the details which had struck me at the time	45.11366020519738
A cold sharp wind whistled through the leafless branches and yet the drops fell from my forehead	59.464978808560645
I recollected that I was stabbed just as I was trampling the ground to fill up the hole while doing so I had leaned against a laburnum behind me was an artificial rockery intended to serve as a restingplace for persons walking in the garden in falling my hand relaxing its hold of the laburnum felt the coldness of the stone	224.51325471608487
On my right I saw the tree behind me the rock	141.3373916824746
I stood in the same attitude and threw myself down	89.94628389036464
I rose and again began digging and enlarging the hole still I found nothing nothingthe chest was no longer there	486.25722814800366
The chest no longer there murmured Madame Danglars choking with fear	281.59103067469465
Think not I contented myself with this one effort continued Villefort	189.11352925364392
No I searched the whole thicket	5393.34603505101
I thought the assassin having discovered the chest and supposing it to be a treasure had intended carrying it off but perceiving his error had dug another hole and deposited it there but I could find nothing	186.63109235977095
Then the idea struck me that he had not taken these precautions and had simply thrown it in a corner	79.66432793815612
In the last case I must wait for daylight to renew my search	153.91196952713202
I remained in the room and waited	63.257002289881925
When daylight dawned I went down again	10.521666309872206
My first visit was to the thicket	393.19217103335905
I hoped to find some traces which had escaped me in the darkness	64.60997151998376
I had turned up the earth over a surface of more than twenty feet square and a depth of two feet	131.95154678195289
A laborer would not have done in a day what occupied me an hour	96.55481747966873
But I could find nothingabsolutely nothing	309.0863363750483
Supposing it had been thrown aside it would probably be on the path which led to the little gate but this examination was as useless as the first and with a bursting heart I returned to the thicket which now contained no hope for me	73.13504909182876
Oh cried Madame Danglars it was enough to drive you mad	166.11986922373328
I hoped for a moment that it might said Villefort but that happiness was denied me	122.82688165225828
However recovering my strength and my ideas Why said I should that man have carried away the corpse	187.45659758581004
But you said replied Madame Danglars he would require it as a proof	61.86062344007212
Ah no madame that could not be	5.481104551279655
Dead bodies are not kept a year they are shown to a magistrate and the evidence is taken	123.6210926587847
Now nothing of the kind has happened	95.52754403990328
What then asked Hermine trembling violently	176.198771196217
Something more terrible more fatal more alarming for usthe child was perhaps alive and the assassin may have saved it	177.6650934596082
Madame Danglars uttered a piercing cry and seizing Villeforts hands exclaimed My child was alive said she you buried my child alive You were not certain my child was dead and you buried it Ah	89.60670801439583
Madame Danglars had risen and stood before the procureur whose hands she wrung in her feeble grasp	172.0906649230823
I know not I merely suppose so as I might suppose anything else replied Villefort with a look so fixed it indicated that his powerful mind was on the verge of despair and madness	121.11395480912338
Ah my child my poor child cried the baroness falling on her chair and stifling her sobs in her handkerchief	60.059142516996815
Villefort becoming somewhat reassured perceived that to avert the maternal storm gathering over his head he must inspire Madame Danglars with the terror he felt	126.25633826483723
You understand then that if it were so said he rising in his turn and approaching the baroness to speak to her in a lower tone we are lost	37.828626193905244
This child lives and someone knows it livessomeone is in possession of our secret and since Monte Cristo speaks before us of a child disinterred when that child could not be found it is he who is in possession of our secret	76.1614900610542
Just God avenging God murmured Madame Danglars	13.929569617406019
Villeforts only answer was a stifled groan	1306.1638333155568
But the childthe child sir repeated the agitated mother	234.96276241868944
How I have searched for him replied Villefort wringing his hands how I have called him in my long sleepless nights how I have longed for royal wealth to purchase a million of secrets from a million of men and to find mine among them At last one day when for the hundredth time I took up my spade I asked myself again and again what the Corsican could have done with the child	105.51968024010417
A child encumbers a fugitive perhaps on perceiving it was still alive he had thrown it into the river	61.418888313078725
Impossible cried Madame Danglars a man may murder another out of revenge but he would not deliberately drown a child	237.28047464715598
Perhaps continued Villefort he had put it in the foundling hospital	465.153473984788
Oh yes yes cried the baroness my child is there	56.037130672413355
I ran to the hospital and learned that the same nightthe night of the 20th of Septembera child had been brought there wrapped in part of a fine linen napkin purposely torn in half	245.66604449112884
This portion of the napkin was marked with half a barons crown and the letter H	298.8970104065722
Truly truly said Madame Danglars all my linen is marked thus Monsieur de Nargonne was a baron and my name is Hermine	213.48170386614223
Thank God my child was not then dead	119.15236565015343
And you can tell me so without fearing to make me die of joy Where is the child	140.1024981604841
Do I know said he and do you believe that if I knew I would relate to you all its trials and all its adventures as would a dramatist or a novel writer Alas no I know not	109.04115704775239
A woman about six months after came to claim it with the other half of the napkin	89.85912471280922
This woman gave all the requisite particulars and it was intrusted to her	94.51419435304213
But you should have inquired for the woman you should have traced her	77.21540147522623
And what do you think I did I feigned a criminal process and employed all the most acute bloodhounds and skilful agents in search of her	310.50542885401967
They traced her to Chlons and there they lost her	131.27537428780133
Madame Danglars had listened to this recital with a sigh a tear or a shriek for every detail	151.41063445956786
And this is all said she and you stopped there	83.21600485378633
Oh no said Villefort I never ceased to search and to inquire	99.47436842875734
However the last two or three years I had allowed myself some respite	87.76504710750717
But now I will begin with more perseverance and fury than ever since fear urges me not my conscience	200.21351253885913
But replied Madame Danglars the Count of Monte Cristo can know nothing or he would not seek our society as he does	54.92184161735238
Oh the wickedness of man is very great said Villefort since it surpasses the goodness of God	83.62683896069028
Did you observe that mans eyes while he was speaking to us	74.5379138821911
But have you ever watched him carefully	198.47113858842977
Doubtless he is capricious but that is all one thing alone struck meof all the exquisite things he placed before us he touched nothing	269.7669154790061
I might have suspected he was poisoning us	970.6609316176749
And you see you would have been deceived	23.562182128170893
But believe me that man has other projects	1245.4233648365991
For that reason I wished to see you to speak to you to warn you against everyone but especially against him	73.7701697671218
Tell me cried Villefort fixing his eyes more steadfastly on her than he had ever done before did you ever reveal to anyone our connection	121.81970746811311
You understand me replied Villefort affectionately when I say anyonepardon my urgencyto anyone living I mean	1164.5336586858589
Yes yes I understand very well ejaculated the baroness never I swear to you	147.18202391597163
Were you ever in the habit of writing in the evening what had transpired in the morning Do you keep a journal	69.00078657225276
No my life has been passed in frivolity I wish to forget it myself	163.21191484332385
Do you talk in your sleep	447.3782894960237
I sleep soundly like a child do you not remember	33.86155902369333
The color mounted to the baronesss face and Villefort turned awfully pale	419.5250460348378
It is true said he in so low a tone that he could hardly be heard	35.74413083648059
Well I understand what I now have to do replied Villefort	47.03471880652912
In less than one week from this time I will ascertain who this M	113.12699554769135
de Monte Cristo is whence he comes where he goes and why he speaks in our presence of children that have been disinterred in a garden	102.15270313617033
Villefort pronounced these words with an accent which would have made the count shudder had he heard him	49.808736337856885
Then he pressed the hand the baroness reluctantly gave him and led her respectfully back to the door	177.94931723548567
Madame Danglars returned in another cab to the passage on the other side of which she found her carriage and her coachman sleeping peacefully on his box while waiting for her	84.64067963394801
The same day during the interview between Madame Danglars and the procureur a travellingcarriage entered the Rue du Helder passed through the gateway of No	63.15369499599222
27 and stopped in the yard	256.887035186987
In a moment the door was opened and Madame de Morcerf alighted leaning on her sons arm	38.98607441069108
Albert soon left her ordered his horses and having arranged his toilet drove to the Champslyses to the house of Monte Cristo	44.58825755049424
The count received him with his habitual smile	37.84697745279416
It was a strange thing that no one ever appeared to advance a step in that mans favor	98.2489335337169
Those who would as it were force a passage to his heart found an impassable barrier	250.18858568381648
Morcerf who ran towards him with open arms was chilled as he drew near in spite of the friendly smile and simply held out his hand	67.30199422233515
Monte Cristo shook it coldly according to his invariable practice	754.6784044832251
And I have come at once to see you	20.43162129201829
That is extremely kind of you said Monte Cristo with a tone of perfect indifference	11.551932665514492
You should not ask a stranger a foreigner for news	467.726132837649
I know it but in asking for news I mean have you done anything for me	116.05948719490294
Had you commissioned me said Monte Cristo feigning uneasiness	118.75710888818865
Come come said Albert do not assume so much indifference	116.0025844531642
It is said sympathy travels rapidly and when at Trport I felt the electric shock you have either been working for me or thinking of me	221.21553231273305
Possibly said Monte Cristo I have indeed thought of you but the magnetic wire I was guiding acted indeed without my knowledge	380.3162941338175
Indeed Pray tell me how it happened	302.0858476642353
I know it to avoid meeting him my mother and I left town	298.3873962362573
What can I know of him He calls himself so	114.53349133424787
I of course give him the same title and everyone else does likewise	269.42867576821885
What a strange man you are What next You say M	203.62020190664998
Yes with Count Cavalcanti the marquis his father Madame Danglars M	193.8446954636746
Why so I thought you wished them to forget you	86.96889430821228
If they did not speak of me I am sure they thought about me and I am in despair	44.88002415153908
How will that affect you since Mademoiselle Danglars was not among the number here who thought of you Truly she might have thought of you at home	124.38043584989038
I have no fear of that or if she did it was only in the same way in which I think of her	33.774365472802224
Touching sympathy So you hate each other said the count	15.244426816889675
Listen said Morcerfif Mademoiselle Danglars were disposed to take pity on my supposed martyrdom on her account and would dispense with all matrimonial formalities between our two families I am ready to agree to the arrangement	190.64421213984804
In a word Mademoiselle Danglars would make a charming mistressbut a wifediable	369.4273975150383
And this said Monte Cristo is your opinion of your intended spouse	291.6299029867397
Yes it is rather unkind I acknowledge but it is true	47.157081257978824
But as this dream can not be realized since Mademoiselle Danglars must become my lawful wife live perpetually with me sing to me compose verses and music within ten paces of me and that for my whole life it frightens me	296.7828998146898
One may forsake a mistress but a wifegood heavens There she must always be and to marry Mademoiselle Danglars would be awful	207.4826922233001
You are difficult to please viscount	2632.5383495847263
Yes for I often wish for what is impossible	38.90063920843559
To find such a wife as my father found	87.77485027821416
Monte Cristo turned pale and looked at Albert while playing with some magnificent pistols	152.1740155957392
Your father was fortunate then said he	20.54991800191618
You know my opinion of my mother count look at herstill beautiful witty more charming than ever	387.26553041938894
For any other son to have stayed with his mother for four days at Trport it would have been a condescension or a martyrdom while I return more contented more peacefulshall I say more poeticthan if I had taken Queen Mab or Titania as my companion	182.54553564241533
That is an overwhelming demonstration and you would make everyone vow to live a single life	66.25058502298684
Such are my reasons for not liking to marry Mademoiselle Danglars	98.11600904965894
Have you ever noticed how much a thing is heightened in value when we obtain possession of it The diamond which glittered in the window at Marls or Fossins shines with more splendor when it is our own but if we are compelled to acknowledge the superiority of another and still must retain the one that is inferior do you not know what we have to endure	163.80219843217645
Thus I shall rejoice when Mademoiselle Eugnie perceives I am but a pitiful atom with scarcely as many hundred thousand francs as she has millions	209.89967922014105
One plan occurred to me continued Albert Franz likes all that is eccentric I tried to make him fall in love with Mademoiselle Danglars but in spite of four letters written in the most alluring style he invariably answered My eccentricity may be great but it will not make me break my promise	146.32071235688701
That is what I call devoted friendship to recommend to another one whom you would not marry yourself	168.1930987996053
Apropos continued he Franz is coming soon but it will not interest you you dislike him I think	100.34922491369936
I said Monte Cristo my dear viscount how have you discovered that I did not like M	29.507949235159657
And you include me in the expression everyonemany thanks	1710.6227106300018
Let us not mistake said Monte Cristo I love everyone as God commands us to love our neighbor as Christians but I thoroughly hate but a few	137.78390006849736
Did you say he was coming	607.7069430977981
de Villefort who is apparently as anxious to get Mademoiselle Valentine married as M	371.79790170311384
Danglars is to see Mademoiselle Eugnie settled	219.77509075266056
It must be a very irksome office to be the father of a grownup daughter it seems to make one feverish and to raise ones pulse to ninety beats a minute until the deed is done	272.99166643191325
dpinay unlike you bears his misfortune patiently	3744.236428771281
Still more he talks seriously about the matter puts on a white tie and speaks of his family	154.88550963582045
He entertains a very high opinion of M	71.26892081748545
Which they deserve do they not	3.6578733043284166
de Villefort has always passed for a severe but a just man	235.64001335490264
There is then one said Monte Cristo whom you do not condemn like poor Danglars	76.56026221973354
Because I am not compelled to marry his daughter perhaps replied Albert laughing	75.85137308103052
Indeed my dear sir said Monte Cristo you are revoltingly foppish	102.70629846374503
I foppish how do you mean	13.276963731694623
Yes pray take a cigar and cease to defend yourself and to struggle to escape marrying Mademoiselle Danglars	163.93707868000632
Let things take their course perhaps you may not have to retract	55.92036977037656
Doubtless my dear viscount you will not be taken by force and seriously do you wish to break off your engagement	58.85405396627555
I would give a hundred thousand francs to be able to do so	8.916672435313528
Danglars would give double that sum to attain the same end	78.7350962845102
Am I indeed so happy said Albert who still could not prevent an almost imperceptible cloud passing across his brow	112.58925488567829
But my dear count has M	1156.460885232053
Ah there is your proud and selfish nature	506.709055127437
You would expose the selflove of another with a hatchet but you shrink if your own is attacked with a needle	174.37537420262603
Delighted with you was he not Well he is a man of bad taste and is still more enchanted with another	103.90893844909974
I know not whom look and judge for yourself	90.72131128052787
But my motherno not my mother I mistakemy father intends giving a ball	1291.2483443500957
If they were not the countess has only to wish it and they would become so	208.4592484064896
You are right You know they are select affairs those who remain in Paris in July must be true Parisians	342.87211019288407
Will you take charge of our invitation to Messieurs Cavalcanti	349.2592908210065
But the son will be here will you invite young M	240.98943446369358
I do not know him viscount	5556.165538210983
No I never saw him until a few days since and am not responsible for him	73.4707251281488
But you receive him at your house	8.059518874999785
That is another thing he was recommended to me by a good abb who may be deceived	46.3003981192556
Give him a direct invitation but do not ask me to present him	34.995288963446626
If he were afterwards to marry Mademoiselle Danglars you would accuse me of intrigue and would be challenging mebesides I may not be there myself	147.63237007217214
Why should you not be there	292.62506139537743
Because you have not yet invited me	127.99475279068729
But I come expressly for that purpose	92.14664111073655
You are very kind but I may be prevented	47.39494985285899
If I tell you one thing you will be so amiable as to set aside all impediments	72.08816168553386
My mother begs you to come	182.03862037731037
The Comtesse de Morcerf said Monte Cristo starting	7.283979610279365
Ah count said Albert I assure you Madame de Morcerf speaks freely to me and if you have not felt those sympathetic fibres of which I spoke just now thrill within you you must be entirely devoid of them for during the last four days we have spoken of no one else	73.90591346820231
Yes that is the penalty of being a living puzzle	239.12166016118437
Then I am also a puzzle to your mother I should have thought her too reasonable to be led by imagination	121.28756146142833
A problem my dear count for everyonefor my mother as well as others much studied but not solved you still remain an enigma do not fear	359.3021310376458
My mother is only astonished that you remain so long unsolved	309.9258675017288
I believe while the Countess G takes you for Lord Ruthven my mother imagines you to be Cagliostro or the Count SaintGermain	201.52046203469777
The first opportunity you have confirm her in her opinion it will be easy for you as you have the philosophy of the one and the wit of the other	57.40966413501867
I thank you for the warning said the count I shall endeavor to be prepared for all suppositions	60.236702187320006
You will then come on Saturday	5150.211104634284
Yes since Madame de Morcerf invites me	1038.1976410776244
He has already been invited by my father	12.509036082925002
We shall try to persuade the great dAguesseau11 M	602.6830559915111
de Villefort to come but have not much hope of seeing him	69.13489981235108
Never despair of anything says the proverb	432.24409741389377
Yes you it would not be astonishing	211.95537428948214
That is very well before one is over forty	248.86899816510277
No I do not dance but I like to see others do so	63.67308546479813
Never you can talk to her she so delights in your conversation	498.5685911243443
Yes truly and I assure you	1.4910882777163394
You are the only man of whom I have heard her speak with interest	50.48645589809033
Albert rose and took his hat the count conducted him to the door	24.86238646542823
I have one thing to reproach myself with said he stopping Albert on the steps	125.50218586469386
I have spoken to you indiscreetly about Danglars	3960.9391337607935
On the contrary speak to me always in the same strain about him	157.80188626123342
I am glad to be reassured on that point	220.70000429713136
Apropos when do you aspect M	75.62299204538084
Five or six days hence at the latest	178.56546399092923
And when is he to be married	13.37568021250392
Immediately on the arrival of M	65.02254888108689
Although you say I do not like him I assure you I shall be happy to see him	17.155030923920894
I will obey your orders my lord	37.399207101753774
Until Saturday when I may expect you may I not	41.88617563364753
The Count watched Albert waving his hand to him	6.912067934792694
When he had mounted his phaeton Monte Cristo turned and seeing Bertuccio What news said he	182.75413874534428
She went to the Palais replied the steward	299.1065256659887
Well my dear Bertuccio said the count I now advise you to go in quest of the little estate I spoke to you of in Normandy	68.96906453424414
Bertuccio bowed and as his wishes were in perfect harmony with the order he had received he started the same evening	118.11092202013747
de Villefort kept the promise he had made to Madame Danglars to endeavor to find out how the Count of Monte Cristo had discovered the history of the house at Auteuil	25.533754353810593
He wrote the same day for the required information to M	96.90678164844722
de Boville who from having been an inspector of prisons was promoted to a high office in the police and the latter begged for two days time to ascertain exactly who would be most likely to give him full particulars	112.20151763359492
At the end of the second day M	57.786630928153464
de Villefort received the following note	5408.875990423017
The person called the Count of Monte Cristo is an intimate acquaintance of Lord Wilmore a rich foreigner who is sometimes seen in Paris and who is there at this moment he is also known to the Abb Busoni a Sicilian priest of high repute in the East where he has done much good	50.59890664241727
de Villefort replied by ordering the strictest inquiries to be made respecting these two persons his orders were executed and the following evening he received these details	133.11984298346226
The abb who was in Paris only for a month inhabited a small twostoried house behind SaintSulpice there were two rooms on each floor and he was the only tenant	189.7200336793825
The two lower rooms consisted of a diningroom with a table chairs and sideboard of walnut and a wainscoted parlor without ornaments carpet or timepiece	614.6621621587444
It was evident that the abb limited himself to objects of strict necessity	640.6584587697429
He preferred to use the sittingroom upstairs which was more library than parlor and was furnished with theological books and parchments in which he delighted to bury himself for months at a time according to his valet de chambre	171.7468070903788
His valet looked at the visitors through a sort of wicket and if their faces were unknown to him or displeased him he replied that the abb was not in Paris an answer which satisfied most persons because the abb was known to be a great traveller	112.7685956905597
Besides whether at home or not whether in Paris or Cairo the abb always left something to give away which the valet distributed through this wicket in his masters name	191.34146569236214
The other room near the library was a bedroom	138.74181275433168
A bed without curtains four armchairs and a couch covered with yellow Utrecht velvet composed with a prieDieu all its furniture	331.75977800342207
Lord Wilmore resided in Rue FontaineSaintGeorges	2044.6677957508145
He was one of those English tourists who consume a large fortune in travelling	461.12346476466837
He hired the apartment in which he lived furnished passed only a few hours in the day there and rarely slept there	150.49512775184783
One of his peculiarities was never to speak a word of French which he however wrote with great facility	157.84443342010377
The day after this important information had been given to the kings attorney a man alighted from a carriage at the corner of the Rue Frou and rapping at an olivegreen door asked if the Abb Busoni were within	52.99275383455861
No he went out early this morning replied the valet	95.98167570995928
I might not always be content with that answer replied the visitor for I come from one to whom everyone must be at home	78.3425668345614
But have the kindness to give the Abb Busoni	35.264546454623
I told you he was not at home repeated the valet	97.51907935211749
Then on his return give him that card and this sealed paper	268.29951724778937
Will he be at home at eight oclock this evening	11.104899565392746
Doubtless unless he is at work which is the same as if he were out	74.17152700459167
I will come again at that time replied the visitor who then retired	72.49823798324663
At the appointed hour the same man returned in the same carriage which instead of stopping this time at the end of the Rue Frou drove up to the green door	40.4542165760378
He knocked and it opened immediately to admit him	121.70656146382849
From the signs of respect the valet paid him he saw that his note had produced a good effect	94.80459807748764
Is the abb at home asked he	9.76110786527876
Yes he is at work in his library but he expects you sir replied the valet	104.42476139979794
The stranger ascended a rough staircase and before a table illumined by a lamp whose light was concentrated by a large shade while the rest of the apartment was in partial darkness he perceived the abb in a monks dress with a cowl on his head such as was used by learned men of the Middle Ages	98.66657688985559
Have I the honor of addressing the Abb Busoni asked the visitor	57.500201503992706
Yes sir replied the abb and you are the person whom M	38.87478713859124
de Boville formerly an inspector of prisons sends to me from the prefect of police	54.01110655026317
One of the agents appointed to secure the safety of Paris	82.34572851519837
Yes sir replied the stranger with a slight hesitation and blushing	65.77782489210315
The abb replaced the large spectacles which covered not only his eyes but his temples and sitting down motioned to his visitor to do the same	123.00171569250388
I am at your service sir said the abb with a marked Italian accent	18.257949252365613
The mission with which I am charged sir replied the visitor speaking with hesitation is a confidential one on the part of him who fulfils it and him by whom he is employed	109.57715524904003
Your probity replied the stranger is so well known to the prefect that he wishes as a magistrate to ascertain from you some particulars connected with the public safety to ascertain which I am deputed to see you	99.37151988956242
It is hoped that no ties of friendship or humane consideration will induce you to conceal the truth	160.67194471110878
Provided sir the particulars you wish for do not interfere with my scruples or my conscience	91.40195801486828
I am a priest sir and the secrets of confession for instance must remain between me and God and not between me and human justice	141.00004842523393
Do not alarm yourself monsieur we will duly respect your conscience	390.0512248125755
At this moment the abb pressed down his side of the shade and so raised it on the other throwing a bright light on the strangers face while his own remained obscured	84.23919621565275
Excuse me abb said the envoy of the prefect of the police but the light tries my eyes very much	104.68957701287911
Now sir I am listeninggo on	22.101419813728338
I will come at once to the point	19.063160843128816
Do you know the Count of Monte Cristo	1.0463776720983826
You mean Monsieur Zaccone I presume	718.8645536288948
Zacconeis not his name Monte Cristo	1.0037200450804868
Monte Cristo is the name of an estate or rather of a rock and not a family name	58.28335164994325
Well be it solet us not dispute about words and since M	197.61472938316086
I asked you if you knew him	50.49960927183817
The son of a rich shipbuilder in Malta	1248.543172063834
I know that is the report but as you are aware the police does not content itself with vague reports	177.7556970169054
However replied the abb with an affable smile when that report is in accordance with the truth everybody must believe it the police as well as all the rest	78.92796971823448
Are you sure of what you assert	281.7069013935103
What do you mean by that question	40.92407657904294
Understand sir I do not in the least suspect your veracity I ask if you are certain of it	126.23274953601829
And when a child I often played with the son in the timberyards	257.82305002102913
But whence does he derive the title of count	49.01277459281322
You are aware that may be bought	69.62281797728538
And his immense riches whence does he procure them	157.3286943798442
They may not be so very great	233.74789975801605
How much do you suppose he possesses	365.0771477803928
From one hundred and fifty to two hundred thousand livres per annum	26.59841787407219
That is reasonable said the visitor I have heard he had three or four millions	32.46796984149708
Two hundred thousand per annum would make four millions of capital	42.38510424208991
But I was told he had four millions per annum	90.7074131346041
Do you know this Island of Monte Cristo	3.6864087300254686
Certainly everyone who has come from Palermo Naples or Rome to France by sea must know it since he has passed close to it and must have seen it	116.9171517498787
I am told it is a delightful place	101.42023519863709
And why has the count bought a rock	719.7477004681019
For the sake of being a count	88.55084384811856
In Italy one must have territorial possessions to be a count	461.1495274840723
You have doubtless heard the adventures of M	95.78648785891657
I know nothing certain at that period of his life I lost sight of my young comrade	49.926621097088216
I think he entered the service	381.08946813387576
No sir I believe he is a Lutheran	246.93394252488778
I say I believe such is the case I do not affirm it besides liberty of conscience is established in France	111.76548846236119
Doubtless and we are not now inquiring into his creed but his actions in the name of the prefect of police I ask you what you know of him	68.43801715232756
He passes for a very charitable man	1839.3781416701047
Our holy father the pope has made him a knight of Jesus Christ for the services he rendered to the Christians in the East he has five or six rings as testimonials from Eastern monarchs of his services	245.25986917356113
No but he is proud of them he is better pleased with rewards given to the benefactors of man than to his destroyers	195.49390694575177
Exactly he is a Quaker with the exception of the peculiar dress	82.62991483112947
Yes everyone who knows him is his friend	52.32580898191575
He is in Paris just now	16.523795013554412
Can he give me any particulars	94.07408795877902
Important ones he was in India with Zaccone	1847.6758886271039
Its somewhere in the Chausse dAntin but I know neither the street nor the number	86.35742965426103
Are you at variance with the Englishman	100.12096964494165
I love Zaccone and he hates him we are consequently not friends	437.3865206210164
Do you think the Count of Monte Cristo had ever been in France before he made this visit to Paris	25.47839057824725
To that question I can answer positively no sir he had not because he applied to me six months ago for the particulars he required and as I did not know when I might again come to Paris I recommended M	92.86560260332381
Now sir I have but one question more to ask and I charge you in the name of honor of humanity and of religion to answer me candidly	83.69100610253756
Do you know with what design M	1202.6434505201926
de Monte Cristo purchased a house at Auteuil	98.60201646035748
To make a lunatic asylum of it similar to that founded by the Count of Pisani at Palermo	195.04182404135435
Do you know about that institution	517318.5072511045
Having said this the abb bowed to imply he wished to pursue his studies	85.06703924125897
The visitor either understood the abbs meaning or had no more questions to ask he arose and the abb accompanied him to the door	91.99677752890025
You are a great almsgiver said the visitor and although you are said to be rich I will venture to offer you something for your poor people will you accept my offering	69.83365890307033
I thank you sir I am only jealous in one thing and that is that the relief I give should be entirely from my own resources	126.29761264870281
My resolution sir is unchangeable but you have only to search for yourself and you will find alas but too many objects upon whom to exercise your benevolence	108.86727865774229
The abb once more bowed as he opened the door the stranger bowed and took his leave and the carriage conveyed him straight to the house of M	47.02687245834624
An hour afterwards the carriage was again ordered and this time it went to the Rue FontaineSaintGeorges and stopped at No	55.570128026823056
The stranger had written to Lord Wilmore requesting an interview which the latter had fixed for ten oclock	122.38094294611685
As the envoy of the prefect of police arrived ten minutes before ten he was told that Lord Wilmore who was precision and punctuality personified was not yet come in but that he would be sure to return as the clock struck	83.55395186230261
The visitor was introduced into the drawingroom which was like all other furnished drawingrooms	147.8606377016026
A mantlepiece with two modern Svres vases a timepiece representing Cupid with his bent bow a mirror with an engraving on each sideone representing Homer carrying his guide the other Belisarius begginga grayish paper red and black tapestrysuch was the appearance of Lord Wilmores drawingroom	753.7517832440911
It was illuminated by lamps with groundglass shades which gave only a feeble light as if out of consideration for the envoys weak sight	283.7996781437802
After ten minutes expectation the clock struck ten at the fifth stroke the door opened and Lord Wilmore appeared	53.72372469866011
He was rather above the middle height with thin reddish whiskers light complexion and light hair turning rather gray	491.8018956090942
He was dressed with all the English peculiarity namely in a blue coat with gilt buttons and high collar in the fashion of 1811 a white kerseymere waistcoat and nankeen pantaloons three inches too short but which were prevented by straps from slipping up to the knee	231.8990163108246
His first remark on entering was	857.0515576379494
You know sir I do not speak French	114.32406845986378
I know you do not like to converse in our language replied the envoy	195.96109409792788
But you may use it replied Lord Wilmore I understand it	65.83373443600705
And I replied the visitor changing his idiom know enough of English to keep up the conversation	664.4153603034013
Do not put yourself to the slightest inconvenience	373.34606439119375
Aw said Lord Wilmore with that tone which is only known to natives of Great Britain	228.704460210057
The envoy presented his letter of introduction which the latter read with English coolness and having finished	96.03678736133354
Then began the questions which were similar to those which had been addressed to the Abb Busoni	40.32208464638824
But as Lord Wilmore in the character of the counts enemy was less restrained in his answers they were more numerous he described the youth of Monte Cristo who he said at ten years of age entered the service of one of the petty sovereigns of India who make war on the English	72.89201999216168
It was there Wilmore had first met him and fought against him and in that war Zaccone had been taken prisoner sent to England and consigned to the hulks whence he had escaped by swimming	169.3010541554194
Then began his travels his duels his caprices then the insurrection in Greece broke out and he had served in the Grecian ranks	311.22010361706526
While in that service he had discovered a silver mine in the mountains of Thessaly but he had been careful to conceal it from everyone	105.17729099580244
After the battle of Navarino when the Greek government was consolidated he asked of King Otho a mining grant for that district which was given him	343.9555932074635
Hence that immense fortune which in Lord Wilmores opinion possibly amounted to one or two millions per annuma precarious fortune which might be momentarily lost by the failure of the mine	300.2882060828447
But asked the visitor do you know why he came to France	44.51507043159446
He is speculating in railways said Lord Wilmore and as he is an expert chemist and physicist he has invented a new system of telegraphy which he is seeking to bring to perfection	180.47722289330255
How much does he spend yearly asked the prefect	383.2670667022275
Not more than five or six hundred thousand francs said Lord Wilmore he is a miser	30.117559964959366
Hatred evidently inspired the Englishman who knowing no other reproach to bring on the count accused him of avarice	183.73971288532567
Do you know his house at Auteuil	68.87494119719968
What do you know respecting it	29.697255385609793
Do you wish to know why he bought it	115.16115856874637
The count is a speculator who will certainly ruin himself in experiments	238.3426258114497
He supposes there is in the neighborhood of the house he has bought a mineral spring equal to those at Bagnres Luchon and Cauterets	278.0892287166569
He is going to turn his house into a Badhaus as the Germans term it	264.8165527607075
He has already dug up all the garden two or three times to find the famous spring and being unsuccessful he will soon purchase all the contiguous houses	140.06173705108867
Now as I dislike him and hope his railway his electric telegraph or his search for baths will ruin him I am watching for his discomfiture which must soon take place	267.3460072786694
What was the cause of your quarrel	596.0451900119182
When he was in England he seduced the wife of one of my friends	45.63548945328004
Why do you not seek revenge	46.865361105159586
I have already fought three duels with him said the Englishman the first with the pistol the second with the sword and the third with the sabre	74.12455897385053
And what was the result of those duels	100.13145738810427
The first time he broke my arm the second he wounded me in the breast and the third time made this large wound	137.20880026698947
The Englishman turned down his shirtcollar and showed a scar whose redness proved it to be a recent one	456.9956445911582
So that you see there is a deadly feud between us	69.65180582443917
But said the envoy you do not go about it in the right way to kill him if I understand you correctly	48.090293265108485
Aw said the Englishman I practice shooting every day and every other day Grisier comes to my house	400.32497317828717
This was all the visitor wished to ascertain or rather all the Englishman appeared to know	99.37305449793998
The agent arose and having bowed to Lord Wilmore who returned his salutation with the stiff politeness of the English he retired	60.02101270022696
Lord Wilmore having heard the door close after him returned to his bedroom where with one hand he pulled off his light hair his red whiskers his false jaw and his wound to resume the black hair dark complexion and pearly teeth of the Count of Monte Cristo	73.08788535558939
de Villefort and not the prefect who returned to the house of M	48.182956763927535
The procureur felt more at ease although he had learned nothing really satisfactory and for the first time since the dinnerparty at Auteuil he slept soundly	122.0273421508813
It was in the warmest days of July when in due course of time the Saturday arrived upon which the ball was to take place at M	86.10153673608889
It was ten oclock at night the branches of the great trees in the garden of the counts house stood out boldly against the azure canopy of heaven which was studded with golden stars but where the last fleeting clouds of a vanishing storm yet lingered	169.5162691518707
From the apartments on the ground floor might be heard the sound of music with the whirl of the waltz and galop while brilliant streams of light shone through the openings of the Venetian blinds	97.37871617338946
At this moment the garden was only occupied by about ten servants who had just received orders from their mistress to prepare the supper the serenity of the weather continuing to increase	121.48366887481293
Until now it had been undecided whether the supper should take place in the diningroom or under a long tent erected on the lawn but the beautiful blue sky studded with stars had settled the question in favor of the lawn	132.82855834869673
The gardens were illuminated with colored lanterns according to the Italian custom and as is usual in countries where the luxuries of the tablethe rarest of all luxuries in their complete formare well understood the suppertable was loaded with waxlights and flowers	457.7212432129196
At the time the Countess of Morcerf returned to the rooms after giving her orders many guests were arriving more attracted by the charming hospitality of the countess than by the distinguished position of the count for owing to the good taste of Mercds one was sure of finding some devices at her entertainment worthy of describing or even copying in case of need	181.08440885843436
Madame Danglars in whom the events we have related had caused deep anxiety had hesitated about going to Madame de Morcerfs when during the morning her carriage happened to meet that of Villefort	187.42546170301992
The latter made a sign and when the carriages had drawn close together said	147.18986889716783
You are going to Madame de Morcerfs are you not	14.509755753097012
No replied Madame Danglars I am too ill	38.304114709774595
You are wrong replied Villefort significantly it is important that you should be seen there	60.16729365000756
Do you think so asked the baroness	13.517308088108077
In that case I will go	20.938313802990567
And the two carriages passed on towards their different destinations	993.0788343399148
Madame Danglars therefore came not only beautiful in person but radiant with splendor she entered by one door at the time when Mercds appeared at the door	121.64173506646235
The countess took Albert to meet Madame Danglars	26.684255516382205
He approached paid her some well merited compliments on her toilet and offered his arm to conduct her to a seat	147.60190028878762
You are looking for my daughter said the baroness smiling	23.428805274702157
Could you have been so cruel as not to bring her	83.95934223664744
She has met Mademoiselle de Villefort and has taken her arm see they are following us both in white dresses one with a bouquet of camellias the other with one of myosotis	158.35526901680493
Well what do you wish to know	17.449302207307987
Will not the Count of Monte Cristo be here tonight	29.05571403775866
I only mean that the count seems the rage replied the viscount smiling and that you are the seventeenth person that has asked me the same question	144.64069565938226
The count is in fashion I congratulate him upon it	313.38123545576696
And have you replied to everyone as you have to me	57.197645951068225
Ah to be sure I have not answered you be satisfied we shall have this lion we are among the privileged ones	118.18401283233722
Were you at the Opera yesterday	134.41375616486587
Ah indeed And did the eccentric person commit any new originality	2695.708565160298
Can he be seen without doing so Elssler was dancing in Le Diable boiteux the Greek princess was in ecstasies	459.25683943259014
After the cachucha he placed a magnificent ring on the stem of a bouquet and threw it to the charming danseuse who in the third act to do honor to the gift reappeared with it on her finger	88.29652297881697
And the Greek princesswill she be here	448.5040413106979
No you will be deprived of that pleasure her position in the counts establishment is not sufficiently understood	152.03058476596183
Wait leave me here and go and speak to Madame de Villefort who is trying to attract your attention	35.968051635209434
Albert bowed to Madame Danglars and advanced towards Madame de Villefort whose lips opened as he approached	18.631766807672758
I wager anything said Albert interrupting her that I know what you were about to say	40.300987682756116
If I guess rightly will you confess it	119.3763468060001
You were going to ask me if the Count of Monte Cristo had arrived or was expected	22.064641814829937
It is not of him that I am now thinking	47.68409786822257
I was going to ask you if you had received any news of Monsieur Franz	67.32211696094517
That he was leaving at the same time as his letter	40.0543218232389
The count will come of that you may be satisfied	29.24032623261095
You know that he has another name besides Monte Cristo	110.34659448031567
No I did not know it	15.824056620216316
Monte Cristo is the name of an island and he has a family name	58.30258641975281
Well then I am better informed than you his name is Zaccone	137.33907368926944
Really you should relate all this aloud you would have the greatest success	99.19592057517347
He served in India discovered a mine in Thessaly and comes to Paris to establish a mineral watercure at Auteuil	268.0187889272489
Well I m sure said Morcerf this is indeed news Am I allowed to repeat it	148.00149094898632
Yes but cautiously tell one thing at a time and do not say I told you	35.21653984356611
Because it is a secret just discovered	1233.9891618603908
Paris you can understand is astonished at the sight of such unusual splendor and the police have made inquiries	126.25134470072243
Well well Nothing more is wanting than to arrest the count as a vagabond on the pretext of his being too rich	99.95380856575456
Indeed that doubtless would have happened if his credentials had not been so favorable	147.12955673505704
Poor count And is he aware of the danger he has been in	60.36637693781759
Then it will be but charitable to inform him	369.14368188040146
When he arrives I will not fail to do so	15.985923980803319
Just then a handsome young man with bright eyes black hair and glossy moustache respectfully bowed to Madame de Villefort	44.216223614588266
Madame said Albert allow me to present to you M	33.08364271331244
Maximilian Morrel captain of Spahis one of our best and above all of our bravest officers	135.4250296159344
I have already had the pleasure of meeting this gentleman at Auteuil at the house of the Count of Monte Cristo replied Madame de Villefort turning away with marked coldness of manner	26.277573549539433
This answer and especially the tone in which it was uttered chilled the heart of poor Morrel	91.72284215040219
But a recompense was in store for him turning around he saw near the door a beautiful fair face whose large blue eyes were without any marked expression fixed upon him while the bouquet of myosotis was gently raised to her lips	117.8632728103725
The salutation was so well understood that Morrel with the same expression in his eyes placed his handkerchief to his mouth and these two living statues whose hearts beat so violently under their marble aspect separated from each other by the whole length of the room forgot themselves for a moment or rather forgot the world in their mutual contemplation	91.79297002737526
They might have remained much longer lost in one another without anyone noticing their abstraction	942.7711059415348
The Count of Monte Cristo had just entered	30.768824609393914
We have already said that there was something in the count which attracted universal attention wherever he appeared	165.42413871049988
It was not the coat unexceptional in its cut though simple and unornamented it was not the plain white waistcoat it was not the trousers that displayed the foot so perfectly formedit was none of these things that attracted the attentionit was his pale complexion his waving black hair his calm and serene expression his dark and melancholy eye his mouth chiselled with such marvellous delicacy which so easily expressed such high disdainthese were what fixed the attention of all upon him	230.38690410227622
Many men might have been handsomer but certainly there could be none whose appearance was more significant if the expression may be used	198.66251211562965
Everything about the count seemed to have its meaning for the constant habit of thought which he had acquired had given an ease and vigor to the expression of his face and even to the most trifling gesture scarcely to be understood	78.89411592659877
Yet the Parisian world is so strange that even all this might not have won attention had there not been connected with it a mysterious story gilded by an immense fortune	194.50060233512414
Meanwhile he advanced through the assemblage of guests under a battery of curious glances towards Madame de Morcerf who standing before a mantlepiece ornamented with flowers had seen his entrance in a lookingglass placed opposite the door and was prepared to receive him	117.50897092019875
She turned towards him with a serene smile just at the moment he was bowing to her	51.163293654585864
No doubt she fancied the count would speak to her while on his side the count thought she was about to address him but both remained silent and after a mere bow Monte Cristo directed his steps to Albert who received him cordially	74.8407122908654
Have you seen my mother asked Albert	32.615925989684364
I have just had the pleasure replied the count but I have not seen your father	24.70949163850247
See he is down there talking politics with that little group of great geniuses	785.3237903446419
Indeed said Monte Cristo and so those gentlemen down there are men of great talent	216.0513332043008
I should not have guessed it	12.0656853855642
And for what kind of talent are they celebrated You know there are different sorts	510.1669089375324
That tall harshlooking man is very learned he discovered in the neighborhood of Rome a kind of lizard with a vertebra more than lizards usually have and he immediately laid his discovery before the Institute	256.59075227148566
The thing was discussed for a long time but finally decided in his favor	75.09038728571025
I can assure you the vertebra made a great noise in the learned world and the gentleman who was only a knight of the Legion of Honor was made an officer	75.7661471616834
Come said Monte Cristo this cross seems to me to be wisely awarded	202.16871669462856
I suppose had he found another additional vertebra they would have made him a commander	378.2777402331868
And who can that person be who has taken it into his head to wrap himself up in a blue coat embroidered with green	43.29599100525972
Oh that coat is not his own idea it is the Republics which deputed David12 to devise a uniform for the Academicians	610.739854517113
Indeed said Monte Cristo so this gentleman is an Academician	243.36991205199303
Within the last week he has been made one of the learned assembly	89.76494874064524
And what is his especial talent	1328.85489392572
His talent I believe he thrusts pins through the heads of rabbits he makes fowls eat madder and punches the spinal marrow out of dogs with whalebone	850.2220616475088
And he is made a member of the Academy of Sciences for this	153.16153742624144
But what has the French Academy to do with all this	79.54159948948246
I was going to tell you	1.8774299493013125
That his experiments have very considerably advanced the cause of science doubtless	482.9617790253396
No that his style of writing is very good	103.03475824963218
This must be very flattering to the feelings of the rabbits into whose heads he has thrust pins to the fowls whose bones he has dyed red and to the dogs whose spinal marrow he has punched out	257.88596563887893
And the other one demanded the count	4.715547060545053
The one in the dark blue coat	13.642088761981137
He is a colleague of the count and one of the most active opponents to the idea of providing the Chamber of Peers with a uniform	80.01649970581502
He was very successful upon that question	919.1923352795022
He stood badly with the Liberal papers but his noble opposition to the wishes of the court is now getting him into favor with the journalists	198.5669047773861
They talk of making him an ambassador	571.9481703987584
And what are his claims to the peerage	230.9803737054884
He has composed two or three comic operas written four or five articles in the Sicle and voted five or six years on the ministerial side	184.14748260256997
Bravo viscount said Monte Cristo smiling you are a delightful cicerone	76.26953176647406
And now you will do me a favor will you not	23.457264080980924
Do not introduce me to any of these gentlemen and should they wish it you will warn me	99.00609689676362
Just then the count felt his arm pressed	24.111099675791575
He turned round it was Danglars	144.0960318583034
Ah is it you baron said he	5.272070311287086
Why do you call me baron said Danglars you know that I care nothing for my title	52.36608741577099
I am not like you viscount you like your title do you not	64.51453928912134
Certainly replied Albert seeing that without my title I should be nothing while you sacrificing the baron would still remain the millionaire	216.1932740815697
Which seems to me the finest title under the royalty of July replied Danglars	228.3935626841239
Unfortunately said Monte Cristo ones title to a millionaire does not last for life like that of baron peer of France or academician for example the millionaires Franck   Poulmann of Frankfurt who have just become bankrupts	434.55802915820055
Yes I received the news this evening by a courier	84.7557877875729
I had about a million in their hands but warned in time I withdrew it a month ago	125.30954486963458
Ah mon Dieu exclaimed Danglars they have drawn on me for 200000 francs	60.73532810348098
Well you can throw out the draft their signature is worth five per cent	156.6879094162398
Yes but it is too late said Danglars I have honored their bills	95.45042446332778
Then said Monte Cristo here are 200000 francs gone after	152.568480004383
Hush do not mention these things said Danglars then approaching Monte Cristo he added especially before young M	152.34667464148836
Cavalcanti after which he smiled and turned towards the young man in question	19.362882330841334
Albert had left the count to speak to his mother Danglars to converse with young Cavalcanti Monte Cristo was for an instant alone	80.0460048265558
The footmen were hastening through the rooms with waiters loaded with ices	345.08072677978697
Monte Cristo wiped the perspiration from his forehead but drew back when the waiter was presented to him he took no refreshment	49.846196846831475
Madame de Morcerf did not lose sight of Monte Cristo she saw that he took nothing and even noticed his gesture of refusal	48.95216453258225
Albert she asked did you notice that	29.05352072553711
That the count has never been willing to partake of food under the roof of M	104.41708639350823
Yes but then he breakfasted with meindeed he made his first appearance in the world on that occasion	97.5013224629662
But your house is not M	267.008059390016
de Morcerfs murmured Mercds and since he has been here I have watched him	35.58413824374833
Well he has taken nothing yet	520.139468809729
Approach him said she and when the next waiter passes insist upon his taking something	370.30439495529026
Just to please me Albert said Mercds	122.5329688143271
Albert kissed his mothers hand and drew near the count	21.52079752812753
Another salver passed loaded like the preceding ones she saw Albert attempt to persuade the count but he obstinately refused	251.4310943534736
Albert rejoined his mother she was very pale	21.825210535639105
Well said she you see he refuses	1619.1460498878978
Yes but why need this annoy you	210.2765314676402
You know Albert women are singular creatures	2355.230330279456
I should like to have seen the count take something in my house if only an ice	166.14268553312723
Perhaps he can not reconcile himself to the French style of living and might prefer something else	99.66301053822468
Oh no I have seen him eat of everything in Italy no doubt he does not feel inclined this evening	124.98574000615623
And besides said the countess accustomed as he is to burning climates possibly he does not feel the heat as we do	247.93607579768556
I do not think that for he has complained of feeling almost suffocated and asked why the Venetian blinds were not opened as well as the windows	283.34656625153485
In a word said Mercds it was a way of assuring me that his abstinence was intended	123.88726616397304
A minute afterwards the blinds were thrown open and through the jessamine and clematis that overhung the window one could see the garden ornamented with lanterns and the supper laid under the tent	186.51338537831975
Dancers players talkers all uttered an exclamation of joyeveryone inhaled with delight the breeze that floated in	257.7854985468055
At the same time Mercds reappeared paler than before but with that imperturbable expression of countenance which she sometimes wore	186.67517297715875
She went straight to the group of which her husband formed the centre	223.77637190204814
Do not detain those gentlemen here count she said they would prefer I should think to breathe in the garden rather than suffocate here since they are not playing	177.94063077330176
Ah said a gallant old general who in 1809 had sung Partant pour la Syriewe will not go alone to the garden	424.6309824624579
Then said Mercds I will lead the way	116.49728547098749
Turning towards Monte Cristo she added count will you oblige me with your arm	115.94727039579402
The count almost staggered at these simple words then he fixed his eyes on Mercds	83.09723771213761
It was only a momentary glance but it seemed to the countess to have lasted for a century so much was expressed in that one look	78.49832144943409
He offered his arm to the countess she took it or rather just touched it with her little hand and they together descended the steps lined with rhododendrons and camellias	206.6404043148026
Behind them by another outlet a group of about twenty persons rushed into the garden with loud exclamations of delight	84.54978309122039
Madame de Morcerf entered an archway of trees with her companion	194.8206028790577
It led through a grove of lindens to a conservatory	295.402716832043
It was too warm in the room was it not count she asked	56.75937708395288
Yes madame and it was an excellent idea of yours to open the doors and the blinds	63.79981778185244
As he ceased speaking the count felt the hand of Mercds tremble	59.62779567107746
But you he said with that light dress and without anything to cover you but that gauze scarf perhaps you feel cold	460.3186676216365
Do you know where I am leading you said the countess without replying to the question	89.15268996803393
No madame replied Monte Cristo but you see I make no resistance	56.60869803216314
We are going to the greenhouse that you see at the other end of the grove	78.54379641914116
The count looked at Mercds as if to interrogate her but she continued to walk on in silence and he refrained from speaking	99.54145416152494
They reached the building ornamented with magnificent fruits which ripen at the beginning of July in the artificial temperature which takes the place of the sun so frequently absent in our climate	231.05931322751422
The countess left the arm of Monte Cristo and gathered a bunch of Muscatel grapes	138.53662296613942
See count she said with a smile so sad in its expression that one could almost detect the tears on her eyelidssee our French grapes are not to be compared I know with yours of Sicily and Cyprus but you will make allowance for our northern sun	152.97949041515554
The count bowed but stepped back	15.622758856270162
Do you refuse said Mercds in a tremulous voice	20.18161010380846
Pray excuse me madame replied Monte Cristo but I never eat Muscatel grapes	164.55925568051566
Mercds let them fall and sighed	3165.578247988441
A magnificent peach was hanging against an adjoining wall ripened by the same artificial heat	394.3668887781745
Mercds drew near and plucked the fruit	163.602587943214
Take this peach then she said	10.06039697474493
What again she exclaimed in so plaintive an accent that it seemed to stifle a sob really you pain me	151.55203639218885
A long silence followed the peach like the grapes fell to the ground	155.33944078308397
Count added Mercds with a supplicating glance there is a beautiful Arabian custom which makes eternal friends of those who have together eaten bread and salt under the same roof	259.11467943992176
I know it madame replied the count but we are in France and not in Arabia and in France eternal friendships are as rare as the custom of dividing bread and salt with one another	116.09666088058137
But said the countess breathlessly with her eyes fixed on Monte Cristo whose arm she convulsively pressed with both hands we are friends are we not	39.093371892851586
The count became pale as death the blood rushed to his heart and then again rising dyed his cheeks with crimson his eyes swam like those of a man suddenly dazzled	77.34637263243084
Certainly we are friends he replied why should we not be	135.71994160757413
The answer was so little like the one Mercds desired that she turned away to give vent to a sigh which sounded more like a groan	120.58301427483963
They went the whole length of the garden without uttering a word	25.320828541288407
Sir suddenly exclaimed the countess after their walk had continued ten minutes in silence is it true that you have seen so much travelled so far and suffered so deeply	100.65569016461927
I have suffered deeply madame answered Monte Cristo	15.332205389638853
Doubtless replied the count since no one hears me complain	307.09614394827923
And your present happiness has it softened your heart	186.09326379346595
My present happiness equals my past misery said the count	73.30937406850741
Are you not married asked the countess	30.357616237682603
I married exclaimed Monte Cristo shuddering who could have told you so	73.17068339493093
No one told me you were but you have frequently been seen at the Opera with a young and lovely woman	59.44778096714362
She is a slave whom I bought at Constantinople madame the daughter of a prince	76.68566465384693
I have adopted her as my daughter having no one else to love in the world	35.91564237834796
You have no sisterno sonno father	645.4885162049699
How can you exist thus without anyone to attach you to life	150.0581891840833
It is not my fault madame	54.21294315077545
At Malta I loved a young girl was on the point of marrying her when war came and carried me away	103.86848177345762
I thought she loved me well enough to wait for me and even to remain faithful to my memory	58.8634452512851
When I returned she was married	1018.7139058947515
This is the history of most men who have passed twenty years of age	30.915847623339886
Perhaps my heart was weaker than the hearts of most men and I suffered more than they would have done in my place that is all	37.604777536658055
The countess stopped for a moment as if gasping for breath	167.5434135951723
Yes she said and you have still preserved this love in your heartone can only love onceand did you ever see her again	229.65245811495333
I never returned to the country where she lived	125.35897317129755
She is then now at Malta	6095.361760837173
And have you forgiven her for all she has made you suffer	64.69171780783459
But only her do you then still hate those who separated you	294.6578514071363
I hate them Not at all why should I The countess placed herself before Monte Cristo still holding in her hand a portion of the perfumed grapes	130.144467841657
Madame I never eat Muscatel grapes replied Monte Cristo as if the subject had not been mentioned before	37.04043240180708
The countess dashed the grapes into the nearest thicket with a gesture of despair	88.71953218706335
Monte Cristo remained as unmoved as if the reproach had not been addressed to him	21.70852875310982
Albert at this moment ran in	18.771001466527782
Oh mother he exclaimed such a misfortune has happened	62.9157640297114
What What has happened asked the countess as though awakening from a sleep to the realities of life did you say a misfortune Indeed I should expect misfortunes	147.6980698793856
He comes to fetch his wife and daughter	17.196920678311464
Because Madame de SaintMran is just arrived in Paris bringing the news of M	48.29326051838709
de SaintMrans death which took place on the first stage after he left Marseilles	54.49730527647754
Madame de Villefort who was in very good spirits would neither believe nor think of the misfortune but Mademoiselle Valentine at the first words guessed the whole truth notwithstanding all the precautions of her father the blow struck her like a thunderbolt and she fell senseless	115.29343304005738
de SaintMran related to Mademoiselle de Villefort said the count	5.593655478177107
He was her grandfather on the mothers side	33.248446189433146
He was coming here to hasten her marriage with Franz	427.35988737481443
de SaintMran also grandfather to Mademoiselle Danglars	37.503476549478705
Albert Albert said Madame de Morcerf in a tone of mild reproof what are you saying Ah count he esteems you so highly tell him that he has spoken amiss	137.05333665129888
And she took two or three steps forward	16.31633623794523
Monte Cristo watched her with an air so thoughtful and so full of affectionate admiration that she turned back and grasped his hand at the same time she seized that of her son and joined them together	54.23852218499706
We are friends are we not she asked	68.58307753860763
Oh madame I do not presume to call myself your friend but at all times I am your most respectful servant	126.39812532031931
The countess left with an indescribable pang in her heart and before she had taken ten steps the count saw her raise her handkerchief to her eyes	55.51849534760643
Do not my mother and you agree asked Albert astonished	433.0475387735768
On the contrary replied the count did you not hear her declare that we were friends	61.199542335669385
They reentered the drawingroom which Valentine and Madame de Villefort had just quitted	32.365034789579745
It is perhaps needless to add that Morrel departed almost at the same time	72.97432672740331
A gloomy scene had indeed just passed at the house of M	29.729957538096553
After the ladies had departed for the ball whither all the entreaties of Madame de Villefort had failed in persuading him to accompany them the procureur had shut himself up in his study according to his custom with a heap of papers calculated to alarm anyone else but which generally scarcely satisfied his inordinate desires	102.81472739710141
But this time the papers were a mere matter of form	222.95374798284976
Villefort had secluded himself not to study but to reflect and with the door locked and orders given that he should not be disturbed excepting for important business he sat down in his armchair and began to ponder over the events the remembrance of which had during the last eight days filled his mind with so many gloomy thoughts and bitter recollections	87.63906722436028
Then instead of plunging into the mass of documents piled before him he opened the drawer of his desk touched a spring and drew out a parcel of cherished memoranda amongst which he had carefully arranged in characters only known to himself the names of all those who either in his political career in money matters at the bar or in his mysterious love affairs had become his enemies	130.35145219546405
Their number was formidable now that he had begun to fear and yet these names powerful though they were had often caused him to smile with the same kind of satisfaction experienced by a traveller who from the summit of a mountain beholds at his feet the craggy eminences the almost impassable paths and the fearful chasms through which he has so perilously climbed	156.1876782296144
When he had run over all these names in his memory again read and studied them commenting meanwhile upon his lists he shook his head	244.8548823989854
No he murmured none of my enemies would have waited so patiently and laboriously for so long a space of time that they might now come and crush me with this secret	124.44355050814474
Though all the earth oerwhelm them to mens eyes	274.0882431848863
but like a phosphoric light they rise but to mislead	1060.5379547020375
The story has been told by the Corsican to some priest who in his turn has repeated it	89.45025490017804
de Monte Cristo may have heard it and to enlighten himself	188.7823013114968
But why should he wish to enlighten himself upon the subject asked Villefort after a moments reflection what interest can this M	154.38963014438897
Zacconeson of a shipowner of Malta discoverer of a mine in Thessaly now visiting Paris for the first timewhat interest I say can he take in discovering a gloomy mysterious and useless fact like this However among all the incoherent details given to me by the Abb Busoni and by Lord Wilmore by that friend and that enemy one thing appears certain and clear in my opinionthat in no period in no case in no circumstance could there have been any contact between him and me	209.38056276310326
But Villefort uttered words which even he himself did not believe	113.98028924511476
He dreaded not so much the revelation for he could reply to or deny its truthhe cared little for that mene mene tekel upharsin which appeared suddenly in letters of blood upon the wallbut what he was really anxious for was to discover whose hand had traced them	466.1947632048687
While he was endeavoring to calm his fearsand instead of dwelling upon the political future that had so often been the subject of his ambitious dreams was imagining a future limited to the enjoyments of home in fear of awakening the enemy that had so long sleptthe noise of a carriage sounded in the yard then he heard the steps of an aged person ascending the stairs followed by tears and lamentations such as servants always give vent to when they wish to appear interested in their masters grief	183.83219613885063
He drew back the bolt of his door and almost directly an old lady entered unannounced carrying her shawl on her arm and her bonnet in her hand	125.82445252022002
The white hair was thrown back from her yellow forehead and her eyes already sunken by the furrows of age now almost disappeared beneath the eyelids swollen with grief	125.84253477232244
Oh sir she said oh sir what a misfortune I shall die of it oh yes I shall certainly die of it	33.46242435921303
And then falling upon the chair nearest the door she burst into a paroxysm of sobs	92.86517600088767
The servants standing in the doorway not daring to approach nearer were looking at Noirtiers old servant who had heard the noise from his masters room and run there also remaining behind the others	146.6775887386691
Villefort rose and ran towards his motherinlaw for it was she	93.8542754535918
Why what can have happened he exclaimed what has thus disturbed you Is M	296.34570773635977
de SaintMran is dead answered the old marchioness without preface and without expression she appeared to be stupefied	278.032188784929
Villefort drew back and clasping his hands together exclaimed	22.751561103697544
A week ago continued Madame de SaintMran we went out together in the carriage after dinner	56.39810328594385
de SaintMran had been unwell for some days still the idea of seeing our dear Valentine again inspired him with courage and notwithstanding his illness he would leave	86.61755179906135
At six leagues from Marseilles after having eaten some of the lozenges he is accustomed to take he fell into such a deep sleep that it appeared to me unnatural still I hesitated to wake him although I fancied that his face was flushed and that the veins of his temples throbbed more violently than usual	92.20587734453737
However as it became dark and I could no longer see I fell asleep I was soon aroused by a piercing shriek as from a person suffering in his dreams and he suddenly threw his head back violently	101.32882460416634
I called the valet I stopped the postilion I spoke to M	115.20146596729798
de SaintMran I applied my smellingsalts but all was over and I arrived at Aix by the side of a corpse	104.50772520162549
Villefort stood with his mouth half open quite stupefied	264.7849481713581
Of course you sent for a doctor	39.84659741882233
Immediately but as I have told you it was too late	16.299889820672306
Yes but then he could tell of what complaint the poor marquis had died	151.69383638960548
Oh yes sir he told me it appears to have been an apoplectic stroke	132.3656438204314
And what did you do then	46.37105294013287
de SaintMran had always expressed a desire in case his death happened during his absence from Paris that his body might be brought to the family vault	130.46949647127414
I had him put into a leaden coffin and I am preceding him by a few days	164.50031835095734
Oh my poor mother said Villefort to have such duties to perform at your age after such a blow	124.74859765281889
God has supported me through all and then my dear marquis he would certainly have done everything for me that I performed for him	90.18598169435963
It is true that since I left him I seem to have lost my senses	42.312294984197706
I can not cry at my age they say that we have no more tearsstill I think that when one is in trouble one should have the power of weeping	92.29683926336345
Where is Valentine sir It is on her account I am here I wish to see Valentine	26.627971530803734
Villefort thought it would be terrible to reply that Valentine was at a ball so he only said that she had gone out with her stepmother and that she should be fetched	88.71000237443657
This instant sirthis instant I beseech you said the old lady	39.472541458245146
Villefort placed the arm of Madame de SaintMran within his own and conducted her to his apartment	32.10295991626551
The marchioness raised her head at this word and beholding the man who so forcibly reminded her of her deeplyregretted child who still lived for her in Valentine she felt touched at the name of mother and bursting into tears she fell on her knees before an armchair where she buried her venerable head	121.97742337381835
Villefort left her to the care of the women while old Barrois ran halfscared to his master for nothing frightens old people so much as when death relaxes its vigilance over them for a moment in order to strike some other old person	211.3393791218578
Then while Madame de SaintMran remained on her knees praying fervently Villefort sent for a cab and went himself to fetch his wife and daughter from Madame de Morcerfs	56.647699247571154
He was so pale when he appeared at the door of the ballroom that Valentine ran to him saying	48.41578064878478
Oh father some misfortune has happened	22.723090603493958
Your grandmamma has just arrived Valentine said M	113.11333676672666
And grandpapa inquired the young girl trembling with apprehension	94.28840821479825
de Villefort only replied by offering his arm to his daughter	59.424299599562666
It was just in time for Valentines head swam and she staggered Madame de Villefort instantly hastened to her assistance and aided her husband in dragging her to the carriage saying	123.87447634526973
What a singular event Who could have thought it Ah yes it is indeed strange	27.144166365563034
And the wretched family departed leaving a cloud of sadness hanging over the rest of the evening	62.371265589370395
At the foot of the stairs Valentine found Barrois awaiting her	195.5242468270688
Noirtier wishes to see you tonight he said in an undertone	29.87074797734799
Tell him I will come when I leave my dear grandmamma she replied feeling with true delicacy that the person to whom she could be of the most service just then was Madame de SaintMran	155.9653070591298
Valentine found her grandmother in bed silent caresses heartwrung sobs broken sighs burning tears were all that passed in this sad interview while Madame de Villefort leaning on her husbands arm maintained all outward forms of respect at least towards the poor widow	142.3772206628232
She soon whispered to her husband	55.87817133807657
I think it would be better for me to retire with your permission for the sight of me appears still to afflict your motherinlaw	95.65402235921799
Yes yes she said softly to Valentine let her leave but do you stay	44.26489574401204
Madame de Villefort left and Valentine remained alone beside the bed for the procureur overcome with astonishment at the unexpected death had followed his wife	101.6062810939498
Meanwhile Barrois had returned for the first time to old Noirtier who having heard the noise in the house had as we have said sent his old servant to inquire the cause on his return his quick intelligent eye interrogated the messenger	76.6712814043126
Alas sir exclaimed Barrois a great misfortune has happened	48.64714822694226
Madame de SaintMran has arrived and her husband is dead	51.318064845168074
de SaintMran and Noirtier had never been on strict terms of friendship still the death of one old man always considerably affects another	207.96299535085973
Noirtier let his head fall upon his chest apparently overwhelmed and thoughtful then he closed one eye in token of inquiry	106.19674007910322
She is at the ball as you know since she came to say goodbye to you in full dress	94.5391417104495
Noirtier again closed his left eye	272.1825467792183
Do you wish to see her Noirtier again made an affirmative sign	183.12562279975947
Well they have gone to fetch her no doubt from Madame de Morcerfs I will await her return and beg her to come up here	51.21180327417345
Is that what you wish for	11.57919747343535
Barrois therefore as we have seen watched for Valentine and informed her of her grandfathers wish	136.31013665855224
Consequently Valentine came up to Noirtier on leaving Madame de SaintMran who in the midst of her grief had at last yielded to fatigue and fallen into a feverish sleep	68.94175777260797
Within reach of her hand they placed a small table upon which stood a bottle of orangeade her usual beverage and a glass	105.78048620767662
Then as we have said the young girl left the bedside to see M	55.910048334196176
Valentine kissed the old man who looked at her with such tenderness that her eyes again filled with tears whose sources he thought must be exhausted	83.69619644966711
The old gentleman continued to dwell upon her with the same expression	34.81621862657114
Yes yes said Valentine you mean that I have yet a kind grandfather left do you not	84.714645499054
The old man intimated that such was his meaning	98.8878688992805
Ah yes happily I have replied Valentine	452.06470452794264
Without that what would become of me	33.20993183396517
It was one oclock in the morning	1.7362722634855234
Barrois who wished to go to bed himself observed that after such sad events everyone stood in need of rest	196.26842992476205
Noirtier would not say that the only rest he needed was to see his child but wished her goodnight for grief and fatigue had made her appear quite ill	193.0333708094448
The next morning she found her grandmother in bed the fever had not abated on the contrary her eyes glistened and she appeared to be suffering from violent nervous irritability	113.93883794178588
Oh dear grandmamma are you worse exclaimed Valentine perceiving all these signs of agitation	170.75262308538484
No my child no said Madame de SaintMran but I was impatiently waiting for your arrival that I might send for your father	43.4366169001054
Yes I wish to speak to him	6.367034144754182
Valentine durst not oppose her grandmothers wish the cause of which she did not know and an instant afterwards Villefort entered	106.00284169639484
Sir said Madame de SaintMran without using any circumlocution and as if fearing she had no time to lose you wrote to me concerning the marriage of this child	94.63101812224146
Yes madame replied Villefort it is not only projected but arranged	155.10977960931712
Your intended soninlaw is named M	29.37006722665298
Is he not the son of General dpinay who was on our side and who was assassinated some days before the usurper returned from the Island of Elba	42.69440638608378
Does he not dislike the idea of marrying the granddaughter of a Jacobin	116.03205596164828
Our civil dissensions are now happily extinguished mother said Villefort M	758.2271982014089
dpinay was quite a child when his father died he knows very little of M	69.1065020638376
Noirtier and will meet him if not with pleasure at least with indifference	80.64766401671588
He is one of the most wellbred young men I know	141.24487470964732
During the whole of this conversation Valentine had remained silent	89.85567782220456
Well sir said Madame de SaintMran after a few minutes reflection I must hasten the marriage for I have but a short time to live	62.47671263825
You madame You dear mamma exclaimed M	34.484425710326256
de Villefort and Valentine at the same time	3.1006825041299346
I know what I am saying continued the marchioness I must hurry you so that as she has no mother she may at least have a grandmother to bless her marriage	207.45589732978024
I am all that is left to her belonging to my poor Rene whom you have so soon forgotten sir	107.98095238807463
Ah madame said Villefort you forget that I was obliged to give a mother to my child	37.69843700270177
A stepmother is never a mother sir	502.00271012928187
But this is not to the purposeour business concerns Valentine let us leave the dead in peace	410.50602002413456
All this was said with such exceeding rapidity that there was something in the conversation that seemed like the beginning of delirium	120.6494310219346
It shall be as you wish madame said Villefort more especially since your wishes coincide with mine and as soon as M	75.25219639433568
My dear grandmother interrupted Valentine consider decorumthe recent death	12027.306588299569
You would not have me marry under such sad auspices	2275.0480468421124
My child exclaimed the old lady sharply let us hear none of the conventional objections that deter weak minds from preparing for the future	358.110342973496
I also was married at the deathbed of my mother and certainly I have not been less happy on that account	56.57375437437724
Still that idea of death madame said Villefort	59.430825436700154
StillAlways I tell you I am going to diedo you understand Well before dying I wish to see my soninlaw	108.4414874783132
I wish to tell him to make my child happy I wish to read in his eyes whether he intends to obey mein fact I will know himI will continued the old lady with a fearful expression that I may rise from the depths of my grave to find him if he should not fulfil his duty	93.27516922236003
Madame said Villefort you must lay aside these exalted ideas which almost assume the appearance of madness	206.91406481976054
The dead once buried in their graves rise no more	1771.8717214790943
And I tell you sir that you are mistaken	15.16940907335161
This night I have had a fearful sleep	266.10879263426057
It seemed as though my soul were already hovering over my body my eyes which I tried to open closed against my will and what will appear impossible above all to you sir I saw with my eyes shut in the spot where you are now standing issuing from that corner where there is a door leading into Madame Villeforts dressingroomI saw I tell you silently enter a white figure	170.88434860867324
It was the fever that disturbed you madame said Villefort	94.66956188792933
Doubt if you please but I am sure of what I say	14.295175058947763
I saw a white figure and as if to prevent my discrediting the testimony of only one of my senses I heard my glass removedthe same which is there now on the table	126.39843367308842
Oh dear mother it was a dream	87.98432430008283
So little was it a dream that I stretched my hand towards the bell but when I did so the shade disappeared my maid then entered with a light	117.48812102354972
Phantoms are visible to those only who ought to see them	73.49965621177135
It was the soul of my husbandWell if my husbands soul can come to me why should not my soul reappear to guard my granddaughter the tie is even more direct it seems to me	186.3339446397768
Oh madame said Villefort deeply affected in spite of himself do not yield to those gloomy thoughts you will long live with us happy loved and honored and we will make you forget	117.40554202108056
Never never never said the marchioness	14647.162577618197
As soon as he arrives inform me	239.92247830132374
And then I also wish to see a notary that I may be assured that all our property returns to Valentine	66.31612732986008
Ah grandmamma murmured Valentine pressing her lips on the burning brow do you wish to kill me Oh how feverish you are we must not send for a notary but for a doctor	42.02697794759532
A doctor said she shrugging her shoulders I am not ill I am thirstythat is all	68.15814679822371
What are you drinking dear grandmamma	6125.097746491725
The same as usual my dear my glass is there on the tablegive it to me Valentine	109.61241506670073
Valentine poured the orangeade into a glass and gave it to her grandmother with a certain degree of dread for it was the same glass she fancied that had been touched by the spectre	40.54571926596229
The marchioness drained the glass at a single draught and then turned on her pillow repeating	166.83162706067816
de Villefort left the room and Valentine seated herself at the bedside of her grandmother	77.54084822074292
The poor child appeared herself to require the doctor she had recommended to her aged relative	161.6699056726279
A bright spot burned in either cheek her respiration was short and difficult and her pulse beat with feverish excitement	413.458788646914
She was thinking of the despair of Maximilian when he should be informed that Madame de SaintMran instead of being an ally was unconsciously acting as his enemy	122.85097907584333
More than once she thought of revealing all to her grandmother and she would not have hesitated a moment if Maximilian Morrel had been named Albert de Morcerf or Raoul de ChteauRenaud but Morrel was of plebeian extraction and Valentine knew how the haughty Marquise de SaintMran despised all who were not noble	142.45178867357737
Her secret had each time been repressed when she was about to reveal it by the sad conviction that it would be useless to do so for were it once discovered by her father and mother all would be lost	55.20008162153731
Two hours passed thus Madame de SaintMran was in a feverish sleep and the notary had arrived	35.29518712299481
Though his coming was announced in a very low tone Madame de SaintMran arose from her pillow	43.84425682093364
The notary she exclaimed let him come in	13.251117496029511
The notary who was at the door immediately entered	55.68902775170815
Go Valentine said Madame de SaintMran and leave me with this gentleman	37.222948937100796
The young girl kissed her grandmother and left with her handkerchief to her eyes at the door she found the valet de chambre who told her that the doctor was waiting in the diningroom	24.72096641123082
The doctor was a friend of the family and at the same time one of the cleverest men of the day and very fond of Valentine whose birth he had witnessed	37.440040356134915
He had himself a daughter about her age but whose life was one continued source of anxiety and fear to him from her mother having been consumptive	168.80982390277327
Oh said Valentine we have been waiting for you with such impatience dear M	75.11526456178018
But first of all how are Madeleine and Antoinette	1022.7921752598952
Madeleine was the daughter of M	72.14675143596884
Antoinette is very well he said and Madeleine tolerably so	316.31254616022017
But you sent for me my dear child	12.722791138223775
It is not your father or Madame de Villefort who is ill	29.43479545459128
As for you although we doctors can not divest our patients of nerves I fancy you have no further need of me than to recommend you not to allow your imagination to take too wide a field	173.3696890065648
dAvrigny carried the science of divination almost to a miraculous extent for he was one of the physicians who always work upon the body through the mind	196.75930312656718
No she replied it is for my poor grandmother	89.77647024575973
You know the calamity that has happened to us do you not	10.07881164391465
Alas said Valentine restraining her tears my grandfather is dead	72.3361086755262
An apoplectic stroke repeated the doctor	42.16038625132668
Yes and my poor grandmother fancies that her husband whom she never left has called her and that she must go and join him	87.45785366819668
dAvrigny I beseech you do something for her	213.6854454402522
In her room with the notary	379.7011365240931
Just as he was his mind perfectly clear but the same incapability of moving or speaking	275.47957911685484
And the same love for youeh my dear child	372.51701756690613
Yes said Valentine he was very fond of me	54.54838920408497
Who does not love you Valentine smiled sadly	1089.9536424295952
An extreme nervous excitement and a strangely agitated sleep she fancied this morning in her sleep that her soul was hovering above her body which she at the same time watched	90.58916884283013
It must have been delirium she fancies too that she saw a phantom enter her chamber and even heard the noise it made on touching her glass	150.24623776116184
It is singular said the doctor I was not aware that Madame de SaintMran was subject to such hallucinations	91.2422130368825
It is the first time I ever saw her in this condition said Valentine and this morning she frightened me so that I thought her mad and my father who you know is a strongminded man himself appeared deeply impressed	124.52187782471144
We will go and see said the doctor what you tell me seems very strange	50.396788259369416
The notary here descended and Valentine was informed that her grandmother was alone	110.82399754191664
Go upstairs she said to the doctor	19.494206727872836
Oh I dare notshe forbade my sending for you and as you say I am myself agitated feverish and out of sorts	105.66162695901353
I will go and take a turn in the garden to recover myself	56.34307198623243
The doctor pressed Valentines hand and while he visited her grandmother she descended the steps	100.5558784305911
We need not say which portion of the garden was her favorite walk	434.028354618485
After remaining for a short time in the parterre surrounding the house and gathering a rose to place in her waist or hair she turned into the dark avenue which led to the bench then from the bench she went to the gate	71.9009123352466
As usual Valentine strolled for a short time among her flowers but without gathering them	187.2166323658738
The mourning in her heart forbade her assuming this simple ornament though she had not yet had time to put on the outward semblance of woe	202.2615912253861
She then turned towards the avenue	915.6222785627976
As she advanced she fancied she heard a voice speaking her name	48.69290671859085
She stopped astonished then the voice reached her ear more distinctly and she recognized it to be that of Maximilian	108.46046308410656
It was indeed Maximilian Morrel who had passed a wretched existence since the previous day	78.0716754124664
With the instinct peculiar to lovers he had anticipated after the return of Madame de SaintMran and the death of the marquis that something would occur at M	89.80659928744494
de Villeforts in connection with his attachment for Valentine	205.95307295625685
His presentiments were realized as we shall see and his uneasy forebodings had goaded him pale and trembling to the gate under the chestnuttrees	173.7260730970281
Valentine was ignorant of the cause of this sorrow and anxiety and as it was not his accustomed hour for visiting her she had gone to the spot simply by accident or perhaps through sympathy	129.36066948017003
Morrel called her and she ran to the gate	14.240104725421846
You here at this hour said she	16.86590413804277
Yes my poor girl replied Morrel I come to bring and to hear bad tidings	143.4515897173913
This is indeed a house of mourning said Valentine speak Maximilian although the cup of sorrow seems already full	285.4991421704894
Dear Valentine said Morrel endeavoring to conceal his own emotion listen I entreat you what I am about to say is very serious	40.196749373954894
When are you to be married	33.27368028545963
I will tell you all said Valentine from you I have nothing to conceal	43.3184107265028
This morning the subject was introduced and my dear grandmother on whom I depended as my only support not only declared herself favorable to it but is so anxious for it that they only await the arrival of M	209.160285683028
dpinay and the following day the contract will be signed	62.260930735509895
A deep sigh escaped the young man who gazed long and mournfully at her he loved	85.85991114220235
Alas replied he it is dreadful thus to hear my condemnation from your own lips	198.4829829393148
The sentence is passed and in a few hours will be executed it must be so and I will not endeavor to prevent it	32.82886422995132
But since you say nothing remains but for M	273.6436677762149
dpinay to arrive that the contract may be signed and the following day you will be his tomorrow you will be engaged to M	51.97579909769242
dpinay for he came this morning to Paris	31.126102420020057
I was at the house of Monte Cristo an hour since said Morrel we were speaking he of the sorrow your family had experienced and I of your grief when a carriage rolled into the courtyard	69.2257457517366
Never till then had I placed any confidence in presentiments but now I can not help believing them Valentine	157.6685875469215
At the sound of that carriage I shuddered soon I heard steps on the staircase which terrified me as much as the footsteps of the commander did Don Juan	252.98789235886412
The door at last opened Albert de Morcerf entered first and I began to hope my fears were vain when after him another young man advanced and the count exclaimed Ah here is the Baron Franz dpinay I summoned all my strength and courage to my support	86.00553862706455
Perhaps I turned pale and trembled but certainly I smiled and five minutes after I left without having heard one word that had passed	137.57998281984712
Valentine the time has arrived when you must answer me	83.90543249529576
And remember my life depends on your answer	58.301986001933145
What do you intend doing Valentine held down her head she was overwhelmed	110.40696188219133
Listen said Morrel it is not the first time you have contemplated our present position which is a serious and urgent one I do not think it is a moment to give way to useless sorrow leave that for those who like to suffer at their leisure and indulge their grief in secret	116.44203253205008
There are such in the world and God will doubtless reward them in heaven for their resignation on earth but those who mean to contend must not lose one precious moment but must return immediately the blow which fortune strikes	201.86127609163313
Do you intend to struggle against our illfortune Tell me Valentine for it is that I came to know	68.22436461387608
Valentine trembled and looked at him with amazement	17.803216678585883
The idea of resisting her father her grandmother and all the family had never occurred to her	59.84642548254083
What do you say Maximilian asked Valentine	14.39772073779982
What do you mean by a struggle Oh it would be a sacrilege	152.17491683132232
What I resist my fathers order and my dying grandmothers wish Impossible	2091.7986556010137
You are too noble not to understand me and you understand me so well that you already yield dear Maximilian	74.10785056932482
No no I shall need all my strength to struggle with myself and support my grief in secret as you say	62.0689081586029
But to grieve my fatherto disturb my grandmothers last momentsnever	3689.0507917769696
You are right said Morrel calmly	95.11326959513706
In what a tone you speak cried Valentine	98.77209062334921
I speak as one who admires you mademoiselle	2624.4562394815935
Mademoiselle cried Valentine mademoiselle Oh selfish man he sees me in despair and pretends he can not understand me	84.63889062616771
Villefort you will not displease the marchioness and tomorrow you will sign the contract which will bind you to your husband	67.35013913730873
But mon Dieu tell me how can I do otherwise	45.43446018731919
Do not appeal to me mademoiselle I shall be a bad judge in such a case my selfishness will blind me replied Morrel whose low voice and clenched hands announced his growing desperation	120.90838705725041
What would you have proposed Maximilian had you found me willing to accede	198.9817963894412
It is not for me to say	21.001581511132912
You are wrong you must advise me what to do	101.92964303880444
Do you seriously ask my advice Valentine	145.30172698136738
Certainly dear Maximilian for if it is good I will follow it you know my devotion to you	39.21263985407784
Valentine said Morrel pushing aside a loose plank give me your hand in token of forgiveness of my anger my senses are confused and during the last hour the most extravagant thoughts have passed through my brain	133.86210212267946
Oh if you refuse my advice	94.74950592964436
What do you advise said Valentine raising her eyes to heaven and sighing	32.60570839246712
I am free replied Maximilian and rich enough to support you	64.55787621440358
I swear to make you my lawful wife before my lips even shall have approached your forehead	352.86320582976174
You make me tremble said the young girl	5.72363055230768
Follow me said Morrel I will take you to my sister who is worthy also to be yours	46.73465476232258
We will embark for Algiers for England for America or if you prefer it retire to the country and only return to Paris when our friends have reconciled your family	140.67910723618328
I feared it Maximilian said she it is the counsel of a madman and I should be more mad than you did I not stop you at once with the word Impossible Morrel impossible	59.704069907603106
You will then submit to what fate decrees for you without even attempting to contend with it said Morrel sorrowfully	373.15971103315354
Well Valentine resumed Maximilian I can only say again that you are right	41.82739228066773
Truly it is I who am mad and you prove to me that passion blinds the most wellmeaning	192.26135374114986
It is then understood that tomorrow you will be irrevocably promised to M	105.97981729241604
Franz dpinay not only by that theatrical formality invented to heighten the effect of a comedy called the signature of the contract but your own will	143.3139639837957
Again you drive me to despair Maximilian said Valentine again you plunge the dagger into the wound What would you do tell me if your sister listened to such a proposition	119.6901122212295
Mademoiselle replied Morrel with a bitter smile I am selfishyou have already said soand as a selfish man I think not of what others would do in my situation but of what I intend doing myself	138.632768456017
I think only that I have known you not a whole year	85.83021377386768
From the day I first saw you all my hopes of happiness have been in securing your affection	92.67160927302487
One day you acknowledged that you loved me and since that day my hope of future happiness has rested on obtaining you for to gain you would be life to me	126.45097809057725
Now I think no more I say only that fortune has turned against meI had thought to gain heaven and now I have lost it	122.85360593541544
It is an everyday occurrence for a gambler to lose not only what he possesses but also what he has not	139.18471739962854
Morrel pronounced these words with perfect calmness Valentine looked at him a moment with her large scrutinizing eyes endeavoring not to let Morrel discover the grief which struggled in her heart	106.3838014733379
But in a word what are you going to do asked she	10.502603262973983
I am going to have the honor of taking my leave of you mademoiselle solemnly assuring you that I wish your life may be so calm so happy and so fully occupied that there may be no place for me even in your memory	92.73298394151352
Adieu Valentine adieu said Morrel bowing	55.350553380844545
Where are you going cried the young girl extending her hand through the opening and seizing Maximilian by his coat for she understood from her own agitated feelings that her lovers calmness could not be real where are you going	78.01556904683545
I am going that I may not bring fresh trouble into your family and to set an example which every honest and devoted man situated as I am may follow	172.73079354290567
Before you leave me tell me what you are going to do Maximilian	15.819589019192257
Speak speak said Valentine I entreat you	15.660831205492439
It can not change unhappy man you know it must not cried the young girl	28.420280367448505
Valentine shook the gate with a strength of which she could not have been supposed to be possessed as Morrel was going away and passing both her hands through the opening she clasped and wrung them	69.52101730173386
I must know what you mean to do said she	23.70106087323202
Oh fear not said Maximilian stopping at a short distance I do not intend to render another man responsible for the rigorous fate reserved for me	131.6580234680909
Another might threaten to seek M	256.4280958186516
Franz to provoke him and to fight with him all that would be folly	51.45641309780128
Franz to do with it He saw me this morning for the first time and has already forgotten he has seen me	56.79721613520078
He did not even know I existed when it was arranged by your two families that you should be united	106.68553559582807
I have no enmity against M	92.71626138397299
Franz and promise you the punishment shall not fall on him	82.18952448629234
On you Valentine Oh Heaven forbid Woman is sacred the woman one loves is holy	810.4214310265387
On yourself then unhappy man on yourself	200.5211109601907
I am the only guilty person am I not said Maximilian	69.65512093288727
Maximilian said Valentine Maximilian come back I entreat you	30.60554363924885
He drew near with his sweet smile and but for his paleness one might have thought him in his usual happy mood	152.7237499439899
Listen my dear my adored Valentine said he in his melodious and grave tone those who like us have never had a thought for which we need blush before the world such may read each others hearts	217.18619878163202
I never was romantic and am no melancholy hero	474.2694917831361
I imitate neither Manfred nor Anthony but without words protestations or vows my life has entwined itself with yours you leave me and you are right in doing soI repeat it you are right but in losing you I lose my life	153.36427468626036
The moment you leave me Valentine I am alone in the world	19.30709349026482
My sister is happily married her husband is only my brotherinlaw that is a man whom the ties of social life alone attach to me no one then longer needs my useless life	162.15377057860255
This is what I shall do I will wait until the very moment you are married for I will not lose the shadow of one of those unexpected chances which are sometimes reserved for us since M	62.8740389869247
Franz may after all die before that time a thunderbolt may fall even on the altar as you approach itnothing appears impossible to one condemned to die and miracles appear quite reasonable when his escape from death is concerned	289.4099663775615
I will then wait until the last moment and when my misery is certain irremediable hopeless I will write a confidential letter to my brotherinlaw another to the prefect of police to acquaint them with my intention and at the corner of some wood on the brink of some abyss on the bank of some river I will put an end to my existence as certainly as I am the son of the most honest man who ever lived in France	76.45967645642813
Valentine trembled convulsively she loosened her hold of the gate her arms fell by her side and two large tears rolled down her cheeks	48.426543311566725
The young man stood before her sorrowful and resolute	725.6343269137583
Oh for pitys sake said she you will live will you not	21.592987037157666
No on my honor said Maximilian but that will not affect you	53.3669524617119
You have done your duty and your conscience will be at rest	43.861391551397425
Valentine fell on her knees and pressed her almost bursting heart	161.70760864512548
Maximilian said she Maximilian my friend my brother on earth my true husband in heaven I entreat you do as I do live in suffering perhaps we may one day be united	105.81039707503001
My God said Valentine raising both her hands to heaven with a sublime expression I have done my utmost to remain a submissive daughter I have begged entreated implored he has regarded neither my prayers my entreaties nor my tears	209.84802861267988
It is done cried she wiping away her tears and resuming her firmness I am resolved not to die of remorse but rather of shame	66.95937040405283
Live Maximilian and I will be yours	167.65654070373662
Say when shall it be Speak command I will obey	284.80051779886105
Morrel who had already gone some few steps away again returned and pale with joy extended both hands towards Valentine through the opening	99.34519329082093
Valentine said he dear Valentine you must not speak thusrather let me die	120.96435644106751
Why should I obtain you by violence if our love is mutual Is it from mere humanity you bid me live I would then rather die	189.24744505930772
Truly murmured Valentine who on this earth cares for me if he does not Who has consoled me in my sorrow but he On whom do my hopes rest On whom does my bleeding heart repose On him on him always on him Yes you are right Maximilian I will follow you	120.80552688161633
I will leave the paternal home I will give up all	54.019696467174015
Oh ungrateful girl that I am cried Valentine sobbing I will give up all even my dear old grandfather whom I had nearly forgotten	86.28928484918293
No said Maximilian you shall not leave him	11.60403536806235
Noirtier has evinced you say a kind feeling towards me	195.50384069266696
Well before you leave tell him all his consent would be your justification in Gods sight	302.79108608704405
As soon as we are married he shall come and live with us instead of one child he shall have two	105.27374621126265
You have told me how you talk to him and how he answers you I shall very soon learn that language by signs Valentine and I promise you solemnly that instead of despair it is happiness that awaits us	137.10375161084158
Oh see Maximilian see the power you have over me you almost make me believe you and yet what you tell me is madness for my father will curse mehe is inflexiblehe will never pardon me	142.40669265457262
Now listen to me Maximilian if by artifice by entreaty by accidentin short if by any means I can delay this marriage will you wait	277.9855986348396
Yes I promise you as faithfully as you have promised me that this horrible marriage shall not take place and that if you are dragged before a magistrate or a priest you will refuse	61.97861724562324
I promise you by all that is most sacred to me in the world namely by my mother	44.688242228784326
We will wait then said Morrel	4.410505717033259
Yes we will wait replied Valentine who revived at these words there are so many things which may save unhappy beings such as we are	131.76982709376554
I rely on you Valentine said Morrel all you do will be well done only if they disregard your prayers if your father and Madame de SaintMran insist that M	98.29110882992782
dpinay should be called tomorrow to sign the contract	47.90482944873233
Then you have my promise Maximilian	380.9194183935732
I will go to you and we will fly but from this moment until then let us not tempt Providence let us not see each other	68.1637037513986
It is a miracle it is a providence that we have not been discovered	56.062992962197065
If we were surprised if it were known that we met thus we should have no further resource	100.63345959217558
You are right Valentine but how shall I ascertain	218.28852060922546
And for myselfI will write to you depend on me	28.44068152014245
I dread this marriage Maximilian as much as you	15.11106038692827
Thank you my adored Valentine thank you that is enough	84.22015572954852
When once I know the hour I will hasten to this spot you can easily get over this fence with my assistance a carriage will await us at the gate in which you will accompany me to my sisters there living retired or mingling in society as you wish we shall be enabled to use our power to resist oppression and not suffer ourselves to be put to death like sheep which only defend themselves by sighs	134.33341909557637
Yes said Valentine I will now acknowledge you are right Maximilian and now are you satisfied with your betrothal said the young girl sorrowfully	62.019830875931014
My adored Valentine words can not express one half of my satisfaction	199.34442729522982
Valentine had approached or rather had placed her lips so near the fence that they nearly touched those of Morrel which were pressed against the other side of the cold and inexorable barrier	109.73288524058383
Adieu then till we meet again said Valentine tearing herself away	81.63122636331845
The sound of a kiss was heard and Valentine fled through the avenue	36.188086509076044
Morrel listened to catch the last sound of her dress brushing the branches and of her footstep on the gravel then raised his eyes with an ineffable smile of thankfulness to heaven for being permitted to be thus loved and then also disappeared	95.92063201884082
The young man returned home and waited all the evening and all the next day without getting any message	95.30453611889737
It was only on the following day at about ten oclock in the morning as he was starting to call on M	28.917677036847355
Deschamps the notary that he received from the postman a small billet which he knew to be from Valentine although he had not before seen her writing	138.83226716245326
Tears entreaties prayers have availed me nothing	40.54317617175715
Yesterday for two hours I was at the church of SaintPhilippeduRoule and for two hours I prayed most fervently	193.2381582467396
Heaven is as inflexible as man and the signature of the contract is fixed for this evening at nine oclock	39.81294371198309
I have but one promise and but one heart to give that promise is pledged to you that heart is also yours	219.8336916061385
This evening then at a quarter to nine at the gate	91.2151322323261
My poor grandmother gets worse and worse yesterday her fever amounted to delirium today her delirium is almost madness	571.207468449463
You will be very kind to me will you not Morrel to make me forget my sorrow in leaving her thus I think it is kept a secret from grandpapa Noirtier that the contract is to be signed this evening	60.114218182664494
Morrel went also to the notary who confirmed the news that the contract was to be signed that evening	63.21318913337753
Then he went to call on Monte Cristo and heard still more	56.90708642265575
Franz had been to announce the ceremony and Madame de Villefort had also written to beg the count to excuse her not inviting him the death of M	46.927443087147786
de SaintMran and the dangerous illness of his widow would cast a gloom over the meeting which she would regret should be shared by the count whom she wished every happiness	126.0608998031255
The day before Franz had been presented to Madame de SaintMran who had left her bed to receive him but had been obliged to return to it immediately after	28.093104554007
It is easy to suppose that Morrels agitation would not escape the counts penetrating eye	233.35486147776032
Monte Cristo was more affectionate than everindeed his manner was so kind that several times Morrel was on the point of telling him all	103.71743791439752
But he recalled the promise he had made to Valentine and kept his secret	115.15104127090788
The young man read Valentines letter twenty times in the course of the day	34.024854525253865
It was her first and on what an occasion Each time he read it he renewed his vow to make her happy	232.544734504664
How great is the power of a woman who has made so courageous a resolution What devotion does she deserve from him for whom she has sacrificed everything How ought she really to be supremely loved She becomes at once a queen and a wife and it is impossible to thank and love her sufficiently	145.9794403016662
Morrel longed intensely for the moment when he should hear Valentine say Here I am Maximilian come and help me	85.26423861485026
He had arranged everything for her escape two ladders were hidden in the cloverfield a cabriolet was ordered for Maximilian alone without a servant without lights at the turning of the first street they would light the lamps as it would be foolish to attract the notice of the police by too many precautions	157.08966897375183
Occasionally he shuddered he thought of the moment when from the top of that wall he should protect the descent of his dear Valentine pressing in his arms for the first time her of whom he had yet only kissed the delicate hand	64.46758194962663
When the afternoon arrived and he felt that the hour was drawing near he wished for solitude his agitation was extreme a simple question from a friend would have irritated him	115.91843475071333
He shut himself in his room and tried to read but his eye glanced over the page without understanding a word and he threw away the book and for the second time sat down to sketch his plan the ladders and the fence	99.35609499097164
At length the hour drew near	12.0606378619844
Never did a man deeply in love allow the clocks to go on peacefully	399.6595196291396
Morrel tormented his so effectually that they struck eight at halfpast six	207.03345422059178
He then said It is time to start the signature was indeed fixed to take place at nine oclock but perhaps Valentine will not wait for that	58.578240523958534
Consequently Morrel having left the Rue Meslay at halfpast eight by his timepiece entered the cloverfield while the clock of SaintPhilippeduRoule was striking eight	138.69016791827312
The horse and cabriolet were concealed behind a small ruin where Morrel had often waited	125.008040280768
The night gradually drew on and the foliage in the garden assumed a deeper hue	207.15934126207537
Then Morrel came out from his hidingplace with a beating heart and looked through the small opening in the gate there was yet no one to be seen	55.56296933810369
The clock struck halfpast eight and still another halfhour was passed in waiting while Morrel walked to and fro and gazed more and more frequently through the opening	147.72358115440267
The garden became darker still but in the darkness he looked in vain for the white dress and in the silence he vainly listened for the sound of footsteps	54.588713097922174
The house which was discernible through the trees remained in darkness and gave no indication that so important an event as the signature of a marriagecontract was going on	120.49827964848785
Morrel looked at his watch which wanted a quarter to ten but soon the same clock he had already heard strike two or three times rectified the error by striking halfpast nine	263.7018733045877
This was already half an hour past the time Valentine had fixed	32.188789316184526
It was a terrible moment for the young man	7.319619139100175
The slightest rustling of the foliage the least whistling of the wind attracted his attention and drew the perspiration to his brow then he tremblingly fixed his ladder and not to lose a moment placed his foot on the first step	91.66716502487786
Amidst all these alternations of hope and fear the clock struck ten	139.15170005211024
It is impossible said Maximilian that the signing of a contract should occupy so long a time without unexpected interruptions	263.9515600874993
I have weighed all the chances calculated the time required for all the forms something must have happened	255.31668286527994
And then he walked rapidly to and fro and pressed his burning forehead against the fence	79.70805723063037
Had Valentine fainted or had she been discovered and stopped in her flight These were the only obstacles which appeared possible to the young man	120.19284492162461
The idea that her strength had failed her in attempting to escape and that she had fainted in one of the paths was the one that most impressed itself upon his mind	77.15869525559405
In that case said he I should lose her and by my own fault	101.23978930811401
He dwelt on this idea for a moment then it appeared reality	89.72981012818838
He even thought he could perceive something on the ground at a distance he ventured to call and it seemed to him that the wind wafted back an almost inarticulate sigh	108.68223499041311
It was impossible to wait longer his temples throbbed violently his eyes were growing dim he passed one leg over the wall and in a moment leaped down on the other side	97.16860266236732
He was on Villeforts premiseshad arrived there by scaling the wall	343.65076198421895
What might be the consequences However he had not ventured thus far to draw back	198.9418880182797
He followed a short distance close under the wall then crossed a path hid entered a clump of trees	122.78579393925652
In a moment he had passed through them and could see the house distinctly	95.55031470283319
Then Morrel saw that he had been right in believing that the house was not illuminated	60.59349491896836
Instead of lights at every window as is customary on days of ceremony he saw only a gray mass which was veiled also by a cloud which at that moment obscured the moons feeble light	161.0500365926998
A light moved rapidly from time to time past three windows of the second floor	50.00029576199156
These three windows were in Madame de SaintMrans room	25.669559922909574
Another remained motionless behind some red curtains which were in Madame de Villeforts bedroom	34.26825619945741
So many times in order to follow Valentine in thought at every hour in the day had he made her describe the whole house that without having seen it he knew it all	85.10189360528936
This darkness and silence alarmed Morrel still more than Valentines absence had done	60.553873918534634
Almost mad with grief and determined to venture everything in order to see Valentine once more and be certain of the misfortune he feared Morrel gained the edge of the clump of trees and was going to pass as quickly as possible through the flowergarden when the sound of a voice still at some distance but which was borne upon the wind reached him	89.22557160077193
At this sound as he was already partially exposed to view he stepped back and concealed himself completely remaining perfectly motionless	344.5050755232641
If it was Valentine alone he would speak as she passed if she was accompanied and he could not speak still he should see her and know that she was safe if they were strangers he would listen to their conversation and might understand something of this hitherto incomprehensible mystery	114.53888639694306
The moon had just then escaped from behind the cloud which had concealed it and Morrel saw Villefort come out upon the steps followed by a gentleman in black	42.05410486300815
They descended and advanced towards the clump of trees and Morrel soon recognized the other gentleman as Doctor dAvrigny	74.55465387415184
The young man seeing them approach drew back mechanically until he found himself stopped by a sycamoretree in the centre of the clump there he was compelled to remain	94.75032905789607
Soon the two gentlemen stopped also	2247.3604066137373
Ah my dear doctor said the procureur Heaven declares itself against my house What a dreadful deathwhat a blow Seek not to console me alas nothing can alleviate so great a sorrowthe wound is too deep and too fresh Dead dead	465.46815788220954
The cold sweat sprang to the young mans brow and his teeth chattered	52.00828830278244
Who could be dead in that house which Villefort himself had called accursed	190.38272186037707
de Villefort replied the doctor with a tone which redoubled the terror of the young man I have not led you here to console you on the contrary	25.717107838784788
What can you mean asked the procureur alarmed	124.41236391760523
I mean that behind the misfortune which has just happened to you there is another perhaps still greater	84.00645732132148
Can it be possible murmured Villefort clasping his hands	7.633762743068285
What are you going to tell me	16.817921849873887
Are we quite alone my friend	14.53088588923502
Yes quite but why all these precautions	12.336837349819064
Because I have a terrible secret to communicate to you said the doctor	40.07105299924715
Villefort fell rather than seated himself	4.876010959877006
The doctor stood before him with one hand placed on his shoulder	20.710051839100235
Morrel horrified supported his head with one hand and with the other pressed his heart lest its beatings should be heard	46.861912089824585
Dead dead repeated he within himself and he felt as if he were also dying	60.99477848423311
Speak doctorI am listening said Villefort strikeI am prepared for everything	268.90967186262026
Madame de SaintMran was doubtless advancing in years but she enjoyed excellent health	1716.4782391443175
Morrel began again to breathe freely which he had not done during the last ten minutes	42.0823869248766
Grief has consumed her said Villefortyes grief doctor After living forty years with the marquis	1494.5219515304216
It is not grief my dear Villefort said the doctor grief may kill although it rarely does and never in a day never in an hour never in ten minutes	143.28620071452877
Villefort answered nothing he simply raised his head which had been cast down before and looked at the doctor with amazement	30.81128012837735
Were you present during the last struggle asked M	225.47300347336636
I was replied the procureur you begged me not to leave	75.15784664376466
Did you notice the symptoms of the disease to which Madame de SaintMran has fallen a victim	49.4694745212326
Madame de SaintMran had three successive attacks at intervals of some minutes each one more serious than the former	203.41812084677068
When you arrived Madame de SaintMran had already been panting for breath some minutes she then had a fit which I took to be simply a nervous attack and it was only when I saw her raise herself in the bed and her limbs and neck appear stiffened that I became really alarmed	129.03644291041763
Then I understood from your countenance there was more to fear than I had thought	72.9592221477177
This crisis past I endeavored to catch your eye but could not	59.9013739701856
You held her handyou were feeling her pulseand the second fit came on before you had turned towards me	279.8998630134592
This was more terrible than the first the same nervous movements were repeated and the mouth contracted and turned purple	286.83357464357647
And at the third she expired	4628.341168845979
At the end of the first attack I discovered symptoms of tetanus you confirmed my opinion	483.1034707871276
Yes before others replied the doctor but now we are alone	46.78240007667783
What are you going to say Oh spare me	165.34081784322157
That the symptoms of tetanus and poisoning by vegetable substances are the same	419.7401157231114
de Villefort started from his seat then in a moment fell down again silent and motionless	51.940235242687514
Morrel knew not if he were dreaming or awake	521.251452500556
Listen said the doctor I know the full importance of the statement I have just made and the disposition of the man to whom I have made it	41.48580298950808
Do you speak to me as a magistrate or as a friend asked Villefort	64.36428684660711
As a friend and only as a friend at this moment	21.697954989463984
The similarity in the symptoms of tetanus and poisoning by vegetable substances is so great that were I obliged to affirm by oath what I have now stated I should hesitate I therefore repeat to you I speak not to a magistrate but to a friend	150.14143493279846
And to that friend I say During the threequarters of an hour that the struggle continued I watched the convulsions and the death of Madame de SaintMran and am thoroughly convinced that not only did her death proceed from poison but I could also specify the poison	164.5400632147236
The symptoms are marked do you seesleep broken by nervous spasms excitation of the brain torpor of the nerve centres	871.7898380014984
Madame de SaintMran succumbed to a powerful dose of brucine or of strychnine which by some mistake perhaps has been given to her	152.84600115588603
Oh it is impossible said he I must be dreaming It is frightful to hear such things from such a man as you Tell me I entreat you my dear doctor that you may be deceived	49.40654552988206
But I do not think so	117.7205279203705
Have pity on me doctor So many dreadful things have happened to me lately that I am on the verge of madness	113.01757859189647
Has anyone besides me seen Madame de SaintMran	29.436310712257445
Has anything been sent for from a chemists that I have not examined	104.06711802814615
Had Madame de SaintMran any enemies	693.3982565445918
Would her death affect anyones interest	463.3863932840946
It could not indeed my daughter is her only heiressValentine alone	454.5739315835233
Oh if such a thought could present itself I would stab myself to punish my heart for having for one instant harbored it	197.92928865189015
Indeed my dear friend said M	229.44737805386202
dAvrigny I would not accuse anyone I speak only of an accident you understandof a mistakebut whether accident or mistake the fact is there it is on my conscience and compels me to speak aloud to you	202.40617916563625
May not Barrois the old servant have made a mistake and have given Madame de SaintMran a dose prepared for his master	96.51009680522415
But how could a dose prepared for M	302.20895984348397
You know poisons become remedies in certain diseases of which paralysis is one	463.93010061853346
For instance having tried every other remedy to restore movement and speech to M	316.9149793983654
Noirtier I resolved to try one last means and for three months I have been giving him brucine so that in the last dose I ordered for him there were six grains	140.3775780801289
This quantity which is perfectly safe to administer to the paralyzed frame of M	219.86727606962032
Noirtier which has become gradually accustomed to it would be sufficient to kill another person	109.23883709493637
My dear doctor there is no communication between M	139.5073551981065
Noirtiers apartment and that of Madame de SaintMran and Barrois never entered my motherinlaws room	155.49114149278685
In short doctor although I know you to be the most conscientious man in the world and although I place the utmost reliance in you I want notwithstanding my conviction to believe this axiom errare humanum est	207.44073887454766
Is there one of my brethren in whom you have equal confidence with myself	237.23557921160543
Why do you ask me thatwhat do you wish	192.07186116370494
Send for him I will tell him what I have seen and we will consult together and examine the body	67.02018615619646
And you will find traces of poison	57.29088859088908
No I did not say of poison but we can prove what was the state of the body we shall discover the cause of her sudden death and we shall say Dear Villefort if this thing has been caused by negligence watch over your servants if from hatred watch your enemies	124.26579111257234
What do you propose to me dAvrigny said Villefort in despair so soon as another is admitted into our secret an inquest will become necessary and an inquest in my houseimpossible Still continued the procureur looking at the doctor with uneasiness if you wish itif you demand it why then it shall be done	153.71280243970136
But doctor you see me already so grievedhow can I introduce into my house so much scandal after so much sorrow My wife and my daughter would die of it And I doctoryou know a man does not arrive at the post I occupyone has not been kings attorney twentyfive years without having amassed a tolerable number of enemies mine are numerous	212.31431594035274
Let this affair be talked of it will be a triumph for them which will make them rejoice and cover me with shame	85.8512247851411
Pardon me doctor these worldly ideas were you a priest I should not dare tell you that but you are a man and you know mankind	62.33855347501833
Doctor pray recall your words you have said nothing have you	48.556646237059944
de Villefort replied the doctor my first duty is to humanity	503.8348592847444
I would have saved Madame de SaintMran if science could have done it but she is dead and my duty regards the living	95.61460017001146
Let us bury this terrible secret in the deepest recesses of our hearts I am willing if anyone should suspect this that my silence on the subject should be imputed to my ignorance	139.8412940325676
Meanwhile sir watch alwayswatch carefully for perhaps the evil may not stop here	180.26752884920438
And when you have found the culprit if you find him I will say to you You are a magistrate do as you will	45.24403395643181
I thank you doctor said Villefort with indescribable joy I never had a better friend than you	57.83207002248001
And as if he feared Doctor dAvrigny would recall his promise he hurried him towards the house	242.11193205882083
When they were gone Morrel ventured out from under the trees and the moon shone upon his face which was so pale it might have been taken for that of a ghost	44.966022251343375
I am manifestly protected in a most wonderful but most terrible manner said he but Valentine poor girl how will she bear so much sorrow	153.58408606518833
As he thought thus he looked alternately at the window with red curtains and the three windows with white curtains	42.77034218795666
The light had almost disappeared from the former doubtless Madame de Villefort had just put out her lamp and the nightlamp alone reflected its dull light on the window	83.67418063939023
At the extremity of the building on the contrary he saw one of the three windows open	32.566117372523834
A waxlight placed on the mantlepiece threw some of its pale rays without and a shadow was seen for one moment on the balcony	141.03287833765214
Morrel shuddered he thought he heard a sob	37.51166042844709
It can not be wondered at that his mind generally so courageous but now disturbed by the two strongest human passions love and fear was weakened even to the indulgence of superstitious thoughts	292.2412833365042
Although it was impossible that Valentine should see him hidden as he was he thought he heard the shadow at the window call him his disturbed mind told him so	84.20925800391029
This double error became an irresistible reality and by one of the incomprehensible transports of youth he bounded from his hidingplace and with two strides at the risk of being seen at the risk of alarming Valentine at the risk of being discovered by some exclamation which might escape the young girl he crossed the flowergarden which by the light of the moon resembled a large white lake and having passed the rows of orangetrees which extended in front of the house he reached the step ran quickly up and pushed the door which opened without offering any resistance	78.19231074754167
Her eyes raised towards heaven were watching a silvery cloud gliding over the azure its form that of a shadow mounting towards heaven	158.26256425015174
Her poetic and excited mind pictured it as the soul of her grandmother	204.7706846550079
Meanwhile Morrel had traversed the anteroom and found the staircase which being carpeted prevented his approach being heard and he had regained that degree of confidence that the presence of M	157.1373372881966
de Villefort even would not have alarmed him	32.06496942842876
He was quite prepared for any such encounter	1110.9482134250622
He would at once approach Valentines father and acknowledge all begging Villefort to pardon and sanction the love which united two fond and loving hearts	621.5733698224453
Happily he did not meet anyone	349.0031965712348
Now especially did he find the description Valentine had given of the interior of the house useful to him he arrived safely at the top of the staircase and while he was feeling his way a sob indicated the direction he was to take	62.85884382966076
He turned back a door partly open enabled him to see his road and to hear the voice of one in sorrow	97.40431147172015
He pushed the door open and entered	20.019898255331164
At the other end of the room under a white sheet which covered it lay the corpse still more alarming to Morrel since the account he had so unexpectedly overheard	84.17246280171513
By its side on her knees and with her head buried in the cushion of an easychair was Valentine trembling and sobbing her hands extended above her head clasped and stiff	83.16957546811395
She had turned from the window which remained open and was praying in accents that would have affected the most unfeeling her words were rapid incoherent unintelligible for the burning weight of grief almost stopped her utterance	250.14757828774992
The moon shining through the open blinds made the lamp appear to burn paler and cast a sepulchral hue over the whole scene	134.48883948713024
Morrel could not resist this he was not exemplary for piety he was not easily impressed but Valentine suffering weeping wringing her hands before him was more than he could bear in silence	165.61583552916883
He sighed and whispered a name and the head bathed in tears and pressed on the velvet cushion of the chaira head like that of a Magdalen by Correggiowas raised and turned towards him	157.298193554605
Valentine perceived him without betraying the least surprise	100.8367607645573
A heart overwhelmed with one great grief is insensible to minor emotions	1027.1438214017287
Morrel held out his hand to her	13.747695172671193
Valentine as her only apology for not having met him pointed to the corpse under the sheet and began to sob again	72.54558204341159
Neither dared for some time to speak in that room	23.976463082194954
They hesitated to break the silence which death seemed to impose at length Valentine ventured	133.1726241174453
My friend said she how came you here Alas I would say you are welcome had not death opened the way for you into this house	164.82346299469918
Valentine said Morrel with a trembling voice I had waited since halfpast eight and did not see you come I became uneasy leaped the wall found my way through the garden when voices conversing about the fatal event	211.19028139737523
Morrel shuddered as he thought of the conversation of the doctor and M	20.804193895437653
de Villefort and he thought he could see through the sheet the extended hands the stiff neck and the purple lips	79.61346376156723
Your servants said he who were repeating the whole of the sorrowful story from them I learned it all	108.47022590769492
But it was risking the failure of our plan to come up here love	203.22766825695368
Forgive me replied Morrel I will go away	20.763684207310284
No said Valentine you might meet someone stay	2522.35605124944
But if anyone should come here	63.47046528914841
The young girl shook her head	1.189022428442644
No one will come said she do not fear there is our safeguard pointing to the bed	97.7889333976994
But what has become of M	159.26576480201152
Franz arrived to sign the contract just as my dear grandmother was dying	158.59690717913327
Alas said Morrel with a feeling of selfish joy for he thought this death would cause the wedding to be postponed indefinitely	223.3292886068912
But what redoubles my sorrow continued the young girl as if this feeling was to receive its immediate punishment is that the poor old lady on her deathbed requested that the marriage might take place as soon as possible she also thinking to protect me was acting against me	87.13919697166982
They both listened steps were distinctly heard in the corridor and on the stairs	50.32258712511845
It is my father who has just left his study	23.41369089815827
To accompany the doctor to the door added Morrel	51.34899184891717
How do you know it is the doctor asked Valentine astonished	46.686314150001934
I imagined it must be said Morrel	24.748065573847455
Valentine looked at the young man they heard the street door close then M	103.24018980719777
de Villefort locked the garden door and returned upstairs	70.71761185515128
He stopped a moment in the anteroom as if hesitating whether to turn to his own apartment or into Madame de SaintMrans Morrel concealed himself behind a door Valentine remained motionless grief seeming to deprive her of all fear	128.16722330713432
de Villefort passed on to his own room	7.7073172279852615
Now said Valentine you can neither go out by the front door nor by the garden	93.41514430467102
Morrel looked at her with astonishment	39.423315855029564
There is but one way left you that is safe said she it is through my grandfathers room	113.22912686754528
I have long wished it he is my only remaining friend and we both need his helpcome	283.2238830998653
Be careful Valentine said Morrel hesitating to comply with the young girls wishes I now see my errorI acted like a madman in coming in here	187.36249149595642
Are you sure you are more reasonable	331.1463191247079
Yes said Valentine and I have but one scruplethat of leaving my dear grandmothers remains which I had undertaken to watch	245.21915751605732
Valentine said Morrel death is in itself sacred	514.5663965999776
Yes said Valentine besides it will not be for long	55.506800864160724
She then crossed the corridor and led the way down a narrow staircase to M	51.27646925254123
Noirtiers room Morrel followed her on tiptoe at the door they found the old servant	29.7199570218479
Barrois said Valentine shut the door and let no one come in	21.108462662356406
Noirtier seated in his chair and listening to every sound was watching the door he saw Valentine and his eye brightened	56.59387712875049
There was something grave and solemn in the approach of the young girl which struck the old man and immediately his bright eye began to interrogate	56.808582839486
said she hurriedly you know poor grandmamma died an hour since and now I have no friend in the world but you	63.85084825180935
His expressive eyes evinced the greatest tenderness	303.69674191195566
To you alone then may I confide my sorrows and my hopes	147.04649277787703
Look attentively then at this gentleman	102.98491482884593
The old man fixed his scrutinizing gaze with slight astonishment on Morrel	126.93440670198852
Maximilian Morrel said she the son of that good merchant of Marseilles whom you doubtless recollect	157.3856428601188
He brings an irreproachable name which Maximilian is likely to render glorious since at thirty years of age he is a captain an officer of the Legion of Honor	82.98131115971432
The old man signified that he recollected him	194.58178551670989
Well grandpapa said Valentine kneeling before him and pointing to Maximilian I love him and will be only his were I compelled to marry another I would destroy myself	109.565117947729
The eyes of the paralytic expressed a multitude of tumultuous thoughts	303.1843946173384
Maximilian Morrel do you not grandpapa asked Valentine	72.2205418404356
And you will protect us who are your children against the will of my father	58.81945349527454
Noirtier cast an intelligent glance at Morrel as if to say perhaps I may	43.9812792124438
Mademoiselle said he you have a sacred duty to fulfil in your deceased grandmothers room will you allow me the honor of a few minutes conversation with M	102.3725858185627
That is it said the old mans eye	26.581605012827776
Then he looked anxiously at Valentine	149.28161855757995
Do you fear he will not understand	22.52011098309159
Oh we have so often spoken of you that he knows exactly how I talk to you	94.2603103934543
Then turning to Maximilian with an adorable smile although shaded by sorrowHe knows everything I know said she	250.02919432989404
Valentine arose placed a chair for Morrel requested Barrois not to admit anyone and having tenderly embraced her grandfather and sorrowfully taken leave of Morrel she went away	182.4078107611852
To prove to Noirtier that he was in Valentines confidence and knew all their secrets Morrel took the dictionary a pen and some paper and placed them all on a table where there was a light	69.24481495026306
But first said Morrel allow me sir to tell you who I am how much I love Mademoiselle Valentine and what are my designs respecting her	80.0055445091869
Noirtier made a sign that he would listen	32.500020159334056
It was an imposing sight to witness this old man apparently a mere useless burden becoming the sole protector support and adviser of the lovers who were both young beautiful and strong	246.04724088188595
His remarkably noble and austere expression struck Morrel who began his story with trembling	79.31980170179459
He related the manner in which he had become acquainted with Valentine and how he had loved her and that Valentine in her solitude and her misfortune had accepted the offer of his devotion	53.17140591905677
He told him his birth his position his fortune and more than once when he consulted the look of the paralytic that look answered That is good proceed	148.74337673190226
And now said Morrel when he had finished the first part of his recital now I have told you of my love and my hopes may I inform you of my intentions	43.840994643118165
This was our resolution a cabriolet was in waiting at the gate in which I intended to carry off Valentine to my sisters house to marry her and to wait respectfully M	98.21982695854479
You do not sanction our project	2911.068410133864
There is another way said Morrel	3.0419877229763777
The old mans interrogative eye said Which	4306.71576493258
I will go continued Maximilian I will seek M	37.19170113180807
Franz dpinayI am happy to be able to mention this in Mademoiselle de Villeforts absenceand will conduct myself toward him so as to compel him to challenge me	122.21605033093034
You wish to know what I will do	14.08563871857063
I will find him as I told you	7.289233408996875
I will tell him the ties which bind me to Mademoiselle Valentine if he be a sensible man he will prove it by renouncing of his own accord the hand of his betrothed and will secure my friendship and love until death if he refuse either through interest or ridiculous pride after I have proved to him that he would be forcing my wife from me that Valentine loves me and will have no other I will fight with him give him every advantage and I shall kill him or he will kill me if I am victorious he will not marry Valentine and if I die I am very sure Valentine will not marry him	77.38400572860078
Noirtier watched with indescribable pleasure this noble and sincere countenance on which every sentiment his tongue uttered was depicted adding by the expression of his fine features all that coloring adds to a sound and faithful drawing	296.37120879576145
Still when Morrel had finished he shut his eyes several times which was his manner of saying No	98.37490580379662
No said Morrel you disapprove of this second project as you did of the first	80.08313982987812
I do signified the old man	1.8996603644320817
But what then must be done asked Morrel	15.497624196276751
Madame de SaintMrans last request was that the marriage might not be delayed must I let things take their course Noirtier did not move	156.43303977635856
I understand said Morrel I am to wait	33.50835615747316
But delay may ruin our plan sir replied the young man	29.087896734243706
Alone Valentine has no power she will be compelled to submit	96.26651014756973
I am here almost miraculously and can scarcely hope for so good an opportunity to occur again	81.6749343944769
Believe me there are only the two plans I have proposed to you forgive my vanity and tell me which you prefer	84.34275102163592
Do you authorize Mademoiselle Valentine to intrust herself to my honor	146.29752541553285
Do you prefer I should seek M	265.5294075322539
Whence then will come the help we needfrom chance resumed Morrel	2420.474129858507
You thoroughly understand me sir Pardon my eagerness for my life depends on your answer	254.9079489260862
Will our help come from you	28.09928531910199
There was so much firmness in the look which gave this answer no one could at any rate doubt his will if they did his power	83.4799072606128
Oh thank you a thousand times But how unless a miracle should restore your speech your gesture your movement how can you chained to that armchair dumb and motionless oppose this marriage A smile lit up the old mans face a strange smile of the eyes in a paralyzed face	208.1549882694069
Then I must wait asked the young man	4.052395528257628
But the contract The same smile returned	508.8841621109754
Will you assure me it shall not be signed	15.609683918865972
The contract shall not be signed cried Morrel	45.24168027134043
Oh pardon me sir I can scarcely realize so great a happiness	118.24405915105346
Notwithstanding that assurance Morrel still hesitated	2277.307561919724
This promise of an impotent old man was so strange that instead of being the result of the power of his will it might emanate from enfeebled organs	113.40444206520796
Is it not natural that the madman ignorant of his folly should attempt things beyond his power The weak man talks of burdens he can raise the timid of giants he can confront the poor of treasures he spends the most humble peasant in the height of his pride calls himself Jupiter	370.87191375856384
Whether Noirtier understood the young mans indecision or whether he had not full confidence in his docility he looked uneasily at him	145.08326275181676
What do you wish sir asked Morrel that I should renew my promise of remaining tranquil Noirtiers eye remained fixed and firm as if to imply that a promise did not suffice then it passed from his face to his hands	72.73772401619736
Shall I swear to you sir asked Maximilian	46.13108142969405
Yes said the paralytic with the same solemnity	67.37977312564254
Morrel understood that the old man attached great importance to an oath	164.56630464385788
I swear to you on my honor said he to await your decision respecting the course I am to pursue with M	64.36779041216444
That is right said the old man	13.074383452810798
Now said Morrel do you wish me to retire	18.583599553476557
Morrel made a sign that he was ready to obey	15.868064569616315
But said he first allow me to embrace you as your daughter did just now	94.21997045619631
Noirtiers expression could not be understood	280.15100732947434
The young man pressed his lips on the same spot on the old mans forehead where Valentines had been	23.682039692509164
Then he bowed a second time and retired	128.19454637448135
He found outside the door the old servant to whom Valentine had given directions	90.78532816864548
Morrel was conducted along a dark passage which led to a little door opening on the garden soon found the spot where he had entered with the assistance of the shrubs gained the top of the wall and by his ladder was in an instant in the cloverfield where his cabriolet was still waiting for him	47.39910346566621
He got in it and thoroughly wearied by so many emotions arrived about midnight in the Rue Meslay threw himself on his bed and slept soundly	79.93442982408274
Two days after a considerable crowd was assembled towards ten oclock in the morning around the door of M	45.04898315826841
de Villeforts house and a long file of mourningcoaches and private carriages extended along the Faubourg SaintHonor and the Rue de la Ppinire	92.90832561599396
Among them was one of a very singular form which appeared to have come from a distance	50.13243443159816
It was a kind of covered wagon painted black and was one of the first to arrive	292.4792086195716
Inquiry was made and it was ascertained that by a strange coincidence this carriage contained the corpse of the Marquis de SaintMran and that those who had come thinking to attend one funeral would follow two	148.56976937483157
The Marquis de SaintMran one of the most zealous and faithful dignitaries of Louis XVIII	90.85899426071892
had preserved a great number of friends and these added to the personages whom the usages of society gave Villefort a claim on formed a considerable body	299.78850106715
Due information was given to the authorities and permission obtained that the two funerals should take place at the same time	79.02524920654383
A second hearse decked with the same funereal pomp was brought to M	163.3240915521972
de Villeforts door and the coffin removed into it from the postwagon	497.202075670631
The two bodies were to be interred in the cemetery of PreLachaise where M	69.24934762010507
de Villefort had long since had a tomb prepared for the reception of his family	75.42387836001582
The remains of poor Rene were already deposited there and now after ten years of separation her father and mother were to be reunited with her	101.95147098847607
The Parisians always curious always affected by funereal display looked on with religious silence while the splendid procession accompanied to their last abode two of the number of the old aristocracythe greatest protectors of commerce and sincere devotees to their principles	378.17910222273895
In one of the mourningcoaches Beauchamp Debray and ChteauRenaud were talking of the very sudden death of the marchioness	133.13625658308212
I saw Madame de SaintMran only last year at Marseilles when I was coming back from Algiers said ChteauRenaud she looked like a woman destined to live to be a hundred years old from her apparent sound health and great activity of mind and body	139.11700073159372
Franz assured me replied Albert that she was sixtysix years old	211.45800837365343
But she has not died of old age but of grief it appears that since the death of the marquis which affected her very deeply she has not completely recovered her reason	120.01625321947267
But of what disease then did she die asked Debray	121.62708490856372
It is said to have been a congestion of the brain or apoplexy which is the same thing is it not	60.64794325460951
It is difficult to believe that it was apoplexy said Beauchamp	57.532105585024816
Madame de SaintMran whom I once saw was short of slender form and of a much more nervous than sanguine temperament grief could hardly produce apoplexy in such a constitution as that of Madame de SaintMran	219.86547872744848
At any rate said Albert whatever disease or doctor may have killed her M	530.2083894512311
de Villefort or rather Mademoiselle Valentineor still rather our friend Franz inherits a magnificent fortune amounting I believe to 80000 livres per annum	289.4360742482537
And this fortune will be doubled at the death of the old Jacobin Noirtier	87.50773772079096
That is a tenacious old grandfather said Beauchamp	113.00634114744393
I think he must have made an agreement with death to outlive all his heirs and he appears likely to succeed	216.41278638298283
He resembles the old Conventionalist of 93 who said to Napoleon in 1814 You bend because your empire is a young stem weakened by rapid growth	454.2618405270103
Take the Republic for a tutor let us return with renewed strength to the battlefield and I promise you 500000 soldiers another Marengo and a second Austerlitz	292.19949994604747
Ideas do not become extinct sire they slumber sometimes but only revive the stronger before they sleep entirely	887.7226568682585
Ideas and men appeared the same to him said Albert	64.64902761989919
One thing only puzzles me namely how Franz dpinay will like a grandfather who can not be separated from his wife	112.71132927959817
In the first carriage with M	74.80221294206936
de Villefort who considers him already as one of the family	36.79416320884184
Such was the conversation in almost all the carriages these two sudden deaths so quickly following each other astonished everyone but no one suspected the terrible secret which M	206.9227371836548
dAvrigny had communicated in his nocturnal walk to M	455.64214762507095
They arrived in about an hour at the cemetery the weather was mild but dull and in harmony with the funeral ceremony	137.34268591586687
Among the groups which flocked towards the family vault ChteauRenaud recognized Morrel who had come alone in a cabriolet and walked silently along the path bordered with yewtrees	169.9792566479367
You here said ChteauRenaud passing his arms through the young captains are you a friend of Villeforts How is it that I have never met you at his house	49.221733269357486
I am no acquaintance of M	857.0450188784259
de Villeforts answered Morrel but I was of Madame de SaintMran	34.141260924115414
Albert came up to them at this moment with Franz	46.717923572375526
The time and place are but illsuited for an introduction	672.7010278420801
said Albert but we are not superstitious	794.819662007548
Morrel allow me to present to you M	25.15047945342755
Franz dpinay a delightful travelling companion with whom I made the tour of Italy	129.0573813661308
Maximilian Morrel an excellent friend I have acquired in your absence and whose name you will hear me mention every time I make any allusion to affection wit or amiability	170.72294908582114
Morrel hesitated for a moment he feared it would be hypocritical to accost in a friendly manner the man whom he was tacitly opposing but his oath and the gravity of the circumstances recurred to his memory he struggled to conceal his emotion and bowed to Franz	105.56157303294044
Mademoiselle de Villefort is in deep sorrow is she not said Debray to Franz	72.88094412290951
Extremely replied he she looked so pale this morning I scarcely knew her	96.81275301084048
These apparently simple words pierced Morrel to the heart	29.641985237674977
This man had seen Valentine and spoken to her The young and highspirited officer required all his strength of mind to resist breaking his oath	202.38983025868146
He took the arm of ChteauRenaud and turned towards the vault where the attendants had already placed the two coffins	86.60265776393219
This is a magnificent habitation said Beauchamp looking towards the mausoleum a summer and winter palace	351.0786528378877
You will in turn enter it my dear dpinay for you will soon be numbered as one of the family	55.29177539222705
I as a philosopher should like a little countryhouse a cottage down there under the trees without so many freestones over my poor body	228.40410614309076
In dying I will say to those around me what Voltaire wrote to Piron Eo rus and all will be over	248.2435460584618
But come Franz take courage your wife is an heiress	105.48845068694659
Politics has made you laugh at everything and political men have made you disbelieve everything	301.95562956482024
But when you have the honor of associating with ordinary men and the pleasure of leaving politics for a moment try to find your affectionate heart which you leave with your stick when you go to the Chamber	92.96606872247409
But tell me said Beauchamp what is life Is it not a halt in Deaths anteroom	245.0331328161764
I am prejudiced against Beauchamp said Albert drawing Franz away and leaving the former to finish his philosophical dissertation with Debray	246.73767084692014
The Villefort vault formed a square of white stones about twenty feet high an interior partition separated the two families and each apartment had its entrance door	167.53122492273184
Here were not as in other tombs ignoble drawers one above another where thrift bestows its dead and labels them like specimens in a museum all that was visible within the bronze gates was a gloomylooking room separated by a wall from the vault itself	560.1772640834215
The two doors before mentioned were in the middle of this wall and enclosed the Villefort and SaintMran coffins	194.57957859965816
There grief might freely expend itself without being disturbed by the trifling loungers who came from a picnic party to visit PreLachaise or by lovers who make it their rendezvous	227.97246812393982
The two coffins were placed on trestles previously prepared for their reception in the righthand crypt belonging to the SaintMran family	313.93541482850986
Villefort Franz and a few near relatives alone entered the sanctuary	1632.39773161294
As the religious ceremonies had all been performed at the door and there was no address given the party all separated ChteauRenaud Albert and Morrel went one way and Debray and Beauchamp the other	118.35830068913812
de Villefort at the gate of the cemetery Morrel made an excuse to wait he saw Franz and M	70.19261439450582
de Villefort get into the same mourningcoach and thought this meeting forboded evil	1757.2073323223678
He then returned to Paris and although in the same carriage with ChteauRenaud and Albert he did not hear one word of their conversation	52.984091632861634
As Franz was about to take leave of M	29.88704607587394
de Villefort When shall I see you again said the latter	18.747771601777007
At what time you please sir replied Franz	159.1671443072387
I am at your command sir shall we return together	104.97832002061081
On the contrary I shall feel much pleasure	287.11313784187456
Thus the future father and soninlaw stepped into the same carriage and Morrel seeing them pass became uneasy	171.21663836299354
Villefort and Franz returned to the Faubourg SaintHonor	13.479652795807588
The procureur without going to see either his wife or his daughter went at once to his study and offering the young man a chair	56.99812609275304
dpinay said he allow me to remind you at this momentwhich is perhaps not so illchosen as at first sight may appear for obedience to the wishes of the departed is the first offering which should be made at their tomballow me then to remind you of the wish expressed by Madame de SaintMran on her deathbed that Valentines wedding might not be deferred	141.08171093544198
You know the affairs of the deceased are in perfect order and her will bequeaths to Valentine the entire property of the SaintMran family the notary showed me the documents yesterday which will enable us to draw up the contract immediately	136.3414432294881
You may call on the notary M	959.0085972715838
Deschamps Place Beauveau Faubourg SaintHonor and you have my authority to inspect those deeds	257.1062248970994
dpinay it is not perhaps the moment for Mademoiselle Valentine who is in deep distress to think of a husband indeed I fear	127.53111570084788
Valentine will have no greater pleasure than that of fulfilling her grandmothers last injunctions there will be no obstacle from that quarter I assure you	206.61581179763292
In that case replied Franz as I shall raise none you may make arrangements when you please I have pledged my word and shall feel pleasure and happiness in adhering to it	143.05137759526406
Then said Villefort nothing further is required	328.4581765804242
The contract was to have been signed three days since we shall find it all ready and can sign it today	67.68004396967008
But the mourning said Franz hesitating	21478.37764656424
Do nt be uneasy on that score replied Villefort no ceremony will be neglected in my house	47.45535297974572
Mademoiselle de Villefort may retire during the prescribed three months to her estate of SaintMran I say hers for she inherits it today	323.60137423572553
There after a few days if you like the civil marriage shall be celebrated without pomp or ceremony	151.42256360213378
Madame de SaintMran wished her daughter should be married there	74.0767949350085
When that is over you sir can return to Paris while your wife passes the time of her mourning with her motherinlaw	158.04520363462063
As you please sir said Franz	301.25132104146
de Villefort have the kindness to wait half an hour Valentine shall come down into the drawingroom	35.31240013957481
Deschamps we will read and sign the contract before we separate and this evening Madame de Villefort shall accompany Valentine to her estate where we will rejoin them in a week	67.99910290040252
Sir said Franz I have one request to make	52.67514871036453
I wish Albert de Morcerf and Raoul de ChteauRenaud to be present at this signature you know they are my witnesses	108.57248331376809
Half an hour will suffice to apprise them will you go for them yourself or shall you send	72.53681349041156
I shall expect you then in half an hour baron and Valentine will be ready	84.07546935899303
Franz bowed and left the room	1.6445016952504679
Scarcely had the door closed when M	173.5998303159912
de Villefort sent to tell Valentine to be ready in the drawingroom in half an hour as he expected the notary and M	43.39933059476447
The news caused a great sensation throughout the house Madame de Villefort would not believe it and Valentine was thunderstruck	97.32453793848994
She looked around for help and would have gone down to her grandfathers room but on the stairs she met M	38.340543140403604
de Villefort who took her arm and led her into the drawingroom	9.608575100178697
In the anteroom Valentine met Barrois and looked despairingly at the old servant	82.80694527247942
A moment later Madame de Villefort entered the drawingroom with her little Edward	50.43537400304438
It was evident that she had shared the grief of the family for she was pale and looked fatigued	74.5333994934437
She sat down took Edward on her knees and from time to time pressed this child on whom her affections appeared centred almost convulsively to her bosom	110.48240593740907
Two carriages were soon heard to enter the courtyard	41.92924044735126
One was the notarys the other that of Franz and his friends	97.61897805068816
In a moment the whole party was assembled	197.6755193545358
Valentine was so pale one might trace the blue veins from her temples round her eyes and down her cheeks	53.495551787783114
ChteauRenaud and Albert looked at each other with amazement the ceremony which was just concluded had not appeared more sorrowful than did that which was about to begin	82.14725680401182
Madame de Villefort had placed herself in the shadow behind a velvet curtain and as she constantly bent over her child it was difficult to read the expression of her face	59.99834110148986
de Villefort was as usual unmoved	3701.6665985553927
The notary after having according to the customary method arranged the papers on the table taken his place in an armchair and raised his spectacles turned towards Franz	92.25431449969663
Franz de Quesnel baron dpinay asked he although he knew it perfectly	189.2629901117073
I have then to inform you sir at the request of M	24.907582464764985
de Villefort that your projected marriage with Mademoiselle de Villefort has changed the feeling of M	58.15585229495437
Noirtier towards his grandchild and that he disinherits her entirely of the fortune he would have left her	125.15992041763782
Let me hasten to add continued he that the testator having only the right to alienate a part of his fortune and having alienated it all the will will not bear scrutiny and is declared null and void	314.3926046178924
said Villefort but I warn M	433.4551414800191
dpinay that during my lifetime my fathers will shall never be questioned my position forbidding any doubt to be entertained	192.49738987666024
Sir said Franz I regret much that such a question has been raised in the presence of Mademoiselle Valentine I have never inquired the amount of her fortune which however limited it may be exceeds mine	90.16662798103006
My family has sought consideration in this alliance with M	65.83563485487103
de Villefort all I seek is happiness	587.9675686830959
Valentine imperceptibly thanked him while two silent tears rolled down her cheeks	53.896528691023704
Besides sir said Villefort addressing himself to his future soninlaw excepting the loss of a portion of your hopes this unexpected will need not personally wound you M	118.34041565890747
Noirtiers weakness of mind sufficiently explains it	1643.0992958790143
It is not because Mademoiselle Valentine is going to marry you that he is angry but because she will marry a union with any other would have caused him the same sorrow	67.96884859153988
Old age is selfish sir and Mademoiselle de Villefort has been a faithful companion to M	34.52321314100304
Noirtier which she can not be when she becomes the Baroness dpinay	229.14505360469485
My fathers melancholy state prevents our speaking to him on any subjects which the weakness of his mind would incapacitate him from understanding and I am perfectly convinced that at the present time although he knows that his granddaughter is going to be married M	90.01784608045439
Noirtier has even forgotten the name of his intended grandson	181.26758836455457
de Villefort had scarcely said this when the door opened and Barrois appeared	36.97699954670257
Gentlemen said he in a tone strangely firm for a servant speaking to his masters under such solemn circumstancesgentlemen M	307.24722987263004
Noirtier de Villefort wishes to speak immediately to M	90.14848714969244
He as well as the notary that there might be no mistake in the person gave all his titles to the bridegroom elect	151.78819432013748
Villefort started Madame de Villefort let her son slip from her knees Valentine rose pale and dumb as a statue	60.92155067164985
Albert and ChteauRenaud exchanged a second look more full of amazement than the first	69.24184614475834
It is impossible said the procureur	85.36849643386586
dpinay can not leave the drawingroom at present	254.23039163535034
It is at this moment replied Barrois with the same firmness that M	65.47590121343053
Noirtier my master wishes to speak on important subjects to M	104.97694594947752
Grandpapa Noirtier can speak now then said Edward with his habitual quickness	125.95364351186075
However his remark did not make Madame de Villefort even smile so much was every mind engaged and so solemn was the situation	132.54515340361445
Nortier resumed Villefort that what he demands is impossible	385.94301470174344
Nortier gives notice to these gentlemen replied Barrois that he will give orders to be carried to the drawingroom	63.29111215876481
Something like a smile was perceptible on Madame de Villeforts countenance	66.84696723312328
Valentine instinctively raised her eyes as if to thank heaven	77.07031002952671
de Villefort and see what this new fancy of your grandfathers is	136.56715983468428
Valentine rose quickly and was hastening joyfully towards the door when M	192.10562477568266
Stop said he I will go with you	13.947312090452995
Excuse me sir said Franz since M	185.6776999796987
Noirtier sent for me I am ready to attend to his wish besides I shall be happy to pay my respects to him not having yet had the honor of doing so	26.861467358749767
Pray sir said Villefort with marked uneasiness do not disturb yourself	45.35611265445608
Forgive me sir said Franz in a resolute tone	29.75997135034474
I would not lose this opportunity of proving to M	96.00547096125386
Noirtier how wrong it would be of him to encourage feelings of dislike to me which I am determined to conquer whatever they may be by my devotion	117.7598253503114
And without listening to Villefort he arose and followed Valentine who was running downstairs with the joy of a shipwrecked mariner who finds a rock to cling to	106.5589871922313
ChteauRenaud and Morcerf exchanged a third look of still increasing wonder	509.18065138178747
Noirtier was prepared to receive them dressed in black and installed in his armchair	137.86121866164223
When the three persons he expected had entered he looked at the door which his valet immediately closed	70.40102559457722
Listen whispered Villefort to Valentine who could not conceal her joy if M	89.8082573605676
Noirtier wishes to communicate anything which would delay your marriage I forbid you to understand him	124.23249383483818
Valentine blushed but did not answer	27.043436796673955
Franz dpinay said he you requested to see him	64.27996156411895
We have all wished for this interview and I trust it will convince you how illformed are your objections to Valentines marriage	231.36821367349884
Noirtier answered only by a look which made Villeforts blood run cold	598.1453229638214
He motioned to Valentine to approach	3002.8083244223194
In a moment thanks to her habit of conversing with her grandfather she understood that he asked for a key	78.59993172953315
Then his eye was fixed on the drawer of a small chest between the windows	37.65584122589207
She opened the drawer and found a key and understanding that was what he wanted again watched his eyes which turned toward an old secretaire which had been neglected for many years and was supposed to contain nothing but useless documents	108.86289310989818
Shall I open the secretaire asked Valentine	66.48928429655197
Valentine opened it and drew out a bundle of papers	15.278876692548824
Is that what you wish for asked she	95.52497043840292
She took successively all the other papers out till the drawer was empty	77.31998115237066
But there are no more said she	134.68890225548807
Noirtiers eye was fixed on the dictionary	110.20627478889291
Yes I understand grandfather said the young girl	4.477713988564857
She pointed to each letter of the alphabet	66.04039559002825
At the letter S the old man stopped her	24.495033163578167
She opened and found the word secret	7449.357486786137
Ah is there a secret spring said Valentine	72.28718030999981
And who knows it Noirtier looked at the door where the servant had gone out	30.693887409432516
Valentine went to the door and called Barrois	90.9526771171835
Villeforts impatience during this scene made the perspiration roll from his forehead and Franz was stupefied	75.76321523561275
Barrois said Valentine my grandfather has told me to open that drawer in the secretaire but there is a secret spring in it which you knowwill you open it	115.16050762131438
Barrois looked at the old man	1.4714260292296277
Barrois touched a spring the false bottom came out and they saw a bundle of papers tied with a black string	127.5864740447314
Is that what you wish for said Barrois	119.28365511660802
Shall I give these papers to M	21.115023740676357
Franz took them from Barrois and casting a glance at the cover read	102.49960610990956
To be given after my death to General Durand who shall bequeath the packet to his son with an injunction to preserve it as containing an important document	257.42193630804525
Well sir asked Franz what do you wish me to do with this paper	8.435063725543685
To preserve it sealed up as it is doubtless said the procureur	41.523511566563464
Do you wish him to read it said Valentine	46.396651232219334
You understand baron my grandfather wishes you to read this paper said Valentine	70.37441943577734
Then let us sit down said Villefort impatiently for it will take some time	58.652359373879584
Sit down said the old man	1.144179818324934
Villefort took a chair but Valentine remained standing by her fathers side and Franz before him holding the mysterious paper in his hand	79.70394568369528
Franz untied it and in the midst of the most profound silence read	41.30470369312528
Extract of the report of a meeting of the Bonapartist Club in the Rue SaintJacques held February 5th 1815	139.6935374199918
February 5th 1815 said he it is the day my father was murdered	39.91082172473828
Valentine and Villefort were dumb the eye of the old man alone seemed to say clearly Go on	89.36300400479001
But it was on leaving this club said he my father disappeared	112.67858656659193
Noirtiers eye continued to say Read	144732.53704361874
The undersigned LouisJacques Beaurepaire lieutenantcolonel of artillery tienne Duchampy general of brigade and Claude Lecharpal keeper of woods and forests declare that on the 4th of February a letter arrived from the Island of Elba recommending to the kindness and the confidence of the Bonapartist Club General Flavien de Quesnel who having served the emperor from 1804 to 1814 was supposed to be devoted to the interests of the Napoleon dynasty notwithstanding the title of baron which Louis XVIII	166.4218172935614
had just granted to him with his estate of pinay	253.64771846870025
A note was in consequence addressed to General de Quesnel begging him to be present at the meeting next day the 5th	127.37546844092098
The note indicated neither the street nor the number of the house where the meeting was to be held it bore no signature but it announced to the general that someone would call for him if he would be ready at nine oclock	50.37012196026452
The meetings were always held from that time till midnight	107.91351899715168
At nine oclock the president of the club presented himself the general was ready the president informed him that one of the conditions of his introduction was that he should be eternally ignorant of the place of meeting and that he would allow his eyes to be bandaged swearing that he would not endeavor to take off the bandage	69.44072538856062
General de Quesnel accepted the condition and promised on his honor not to seek to discover the road they took	117.66945936674688
The generals carriage was ready but the president told him it was impossible for him to use it since it was useless to blindfold the master if the coachman knew through what streets he went	86.54027829795895
What must be done then asked the general	14.183151512596357
I have my carriage here said the president	15.093230209246082
Have you then so much confidence in your servant that you can intrust him with a secret you will not allow me to know	45.60927761854312
Our coachman is a member of the club said the president we shall be driven by a StateCouncillor	51.48441466090756
Then we run another risk said the general laughing that of being upset	116.43820166369393
We insert this joke to prove that the general was not in the least compelled to attend the meeting but that he came willingly	79.5060776712599
When they were seated in the carriage the president reminded the general of his promise to allow his eyes to be bandaged to which he made no opposition	86.93056311140907
On the road the president thought he saw the general make an attempt to remove the handkerchief and reminded him of his oath	104.38953905635951
The carriage stopped at an alley leading out of the Rue SaintJacques	60.56899409952768
The general alighted leaning on the arm of the president of whose dignity he was not aware considering him simply as a member of the club they went through the alley mounted a flight of stairs and entered the assemblyroom	116.15797980544181
The members apprised of the sort of presentation which was to be made that evening were all in attendance	117.09387981196882
When in the middle of the room the general was invited to remove his bandage he did so immediately and was surprised to see so many wellknown faces in a society of whose existence he had till then been ignorant	90.26797718529977
They questioned him as to his sentiments but he contented himself with answering that the letters from the Island of Elba ought to have informed them	54.65111431091102
Franz interrupted himself by saying My father was a royalist they need not have asked his sentiments which were well known	117.48351477850011
And hence said Villefort arose my affection for your father my dear M	45.660387457958414
Opinions held in common are a ready bond of union	527.1911645449866
Read again said the old man	1.1511940935835876
The president then sought to make him speak more explicitly but M	184.73033967307205
de Quesnel replied that he wished first to know what they wanted with him	79.7834353707286
He was then informed of the contents of the letter from the Island of Elba in which he was recommended to the club as a man who would be likely to advance the interests of their party	30.021611720667757
One paragraph spoke of the return of Bonaparte and promised another letter and further details on the arrival of the Pharaon belonging to the shipbuilder Morrel of Marseilles whose captain was entirely devoted to the emperor	137.81543816695748
During all this time the general on whom they thought to have relied as on a brother manifested evidently signs of discontent and repugnance	296.3937631825486
When the reading was finished he remained silent with knitted brows	283.76848419409095
Well asked the president what do you say to this letter general	62.889532925900234
I say that it is too soon after declaring myself for Louis XVIII	241.64662838822085
to break my vow in behalf of the exemperor	311.770574395713
This answer was too clear to permit of any mistake as to his sentiments	135.3440138185657
General said the president we acknowledge no King Louis XVIII	287.03787667197076
or an exemperor but his majesty the emperor and king driven from France which is his kingdom by violence and treason	248.58789804572345
Excuse me gentlemen said the general you may not acknowledge Louis XVIII	85.58878116960939
but I do as he has made me a baron and a fieldmarshal and I shall never forget that for these two titles I am indebted to his happy return to France	76.79158496802397
Sir said the president rising with gravity be careful what you say your words clearly show us that they are deceived concerning you in the Island of Elba and have deceived us The communication has been made to you in consequence of the confidence placed in you and which does you honor	122.29176166346873
Now we discover our error a title and promotion attach you to the government we wish to overturn	326.6291020578413
We will not constrain you to help us we enroll no one against his conscience but we will compel you to act generously even if you are not disposed to do so	103.59596714978511
You would call acting generously knowing your conspiracy and not informing against you that is what I should call becoming your accomplice	284.51478733407845
You see I am more candid than you	79.74737465423912
Ah my father said Franz interrupting himself	105.82900000664404
I understand now why they murdered him	167.97103862939827
Valentine could not help casting one glance towards the young man whose filial enthusiasm it was delightful to behold	93.44332727068635
Villefort walked to and fro behind them	156.5844596854967
Noirtier watched the expression of each one and preserved his dignified and commanding attitude	528.7223942949055
Franz returned to the manuscript and continued	124.09136388047708
Sir said the president you have been invited to join this assemblyyou were not forced here it was proposed to you to come blindfoldedyou accepted	227.5210609098492
When you complied with this twofold request you well knew we did not wish to secure the throne of Louis XVIII	95.22483878706066
or we should not take so much care to avoid the vigilance of the police	56.481877534037395
It would be conceding too much to allow you to put on a mask to aid you in the discovery of our secret and then to remove it that you may ruin those who have confided in you	63.047449251622766
No no you must first say if you declare yourself for the king of a day who now reigns or for his majesty the emperor	115.26665824320361
I am a royalist replied the general I have taken the oath of allegiance to Louis XVIII	51.09662936895941
and I will adhere to it	120.5693232309127
These words were followed by a general murmur and it was evident that several of the members were discussing the propriety of making the general repent of his rashness	148.76658470741208
The president again arose and having imposed silence saidSir you are too serious and too sensible a man not to understand the consequences of our present situation and your candor has already dictated to us the conditions which remain for us to offer you	157.90473941746242
The general putting his hand on his sword exclaimedIf you talk of honor do not begin by disavowing its laws and impose nothing by violence	201.00559071747128
And you sir continued the president with a calmness still more terrible than the generals anger I advise you not to touch your sword	76.30868127422366
The general looked around him with slight uneasiness however he did not yield but calling up all his fortitude saidI will not swear	154.32959264893807
Then you must die replied the president calmly	113.6318639388678
dpinay became very pale he looked round him a second time several members of the club were whispering and getting their arms from under their cloaks	167.63894519054895
General said the president do not alarm yourself you are among men of honor who will use every means to convince you before resorting to the last extremity but as you have said you are among conspirators you are in possession of our secret and you must restore it to us	68.93896561412055
A significant silence followed these words and as the general did not replyClose the doors said the president to the doorkeeper	75.9010105842825
The same deadly silence succeeded these words	30.56370384674633
Then the general advanced and making a violent effort to control his feelingsI have a son said he and I ought to think of him finding myself among assassins	131.4286407071778
General said the chief of the assembly one man may insult fiftyit is the privilege of weakness	265.0755950448894
But he does wrong to use his privilege	289.5354495534911
Follow my advice swear and do not insult	49.32609716406909
The general again daunted by the superiority of the chief hesitated a moment then advancing to the presidents deskWhat is the form said he	142.56762425139945
It is thisI swear by my honor not to reveal to anyone what I have seen and heard on the 5th of February 1815 between nine and ten oclock in the evening and I plead guilty of death should I ever violate this oath	77.19461372922696
The general appeared to be affected by a nervous tremor which prevented his answering for some moments then overcoming his manifest repugnance he pronounced the required oath but in so low a tone as to be scarcely audible to the majority of the members who insisted on his repeating it clearly and distinctly which he did	193.42613786672834
Now am I at liberty to retire said the general	56.28555858617335
The president rose appointed three members to accompany him and got into the carriage with the general after bandaging his eyes	97.63820503838541
One of those three members was the coachman who had driven them there	78.53313028099859
Where do you wish to be taken asked the president	40.45198649632492
Anywhere out of your presence replied M	207.45366397205296
Beware sir replied the president you are no longer in the assembly and have only to do with individuals do not insult them unless you wish to be held responsible	65.24873728921513
dpinay went onYou are still as brave in your carriage as in your assembly because you are still four against one	125.60001709868266
They were at that part of the Quai des Ormes where the steps lead down to the river	58.842894435739716
Why do you stop here asked dpinay	436.6782143718398
Because sir said the president you have insulted a man and that man will not go one step farther without demanding honorable reparation	162.6711471665542
Another method of assassination said the general shrugging his shoulders	29.868694849897004
Make no noise sir unless you wish me to consider you as one of the men of whom you spoke just now as cowards who take their weakness for a shield	46.200160362953596
You are alone one alone shall answer you you have a sword by your side I have one in my cane you have no witness one of these gentlemen will serve you	79.06046042977155
Now if you please remove your bandage	159.2069951197516
The general tore the handkerchief from his eyes	8.637900880240672
At last said he I shall know with whom I have to do	32.79835461711387
They opened the door and the four men alighted	110.52195648090719
Franz again interrupted himself and wiped the cold drops from his brow there was something awful in hearing the son read aloud in trembling pallor these details of his fathers death which had hitherto been a mystery	136.45275980086438
Valentine clasped her hands as if in prayer	72.85077471714354
Noirtier looked at Villefort with an almost sublime expression of contempt and pride	49.423848136633445
It was as we said the fifth of February	194.7741169964752
For three days the mercury had been five or six degrees below freezing and the steps were covered with ice	149.36437514239753
The general was stout and tall the president offered him the side of the railing to assist him in getting down	126.80698228584993
The ground from the steps to the river was covered with snow and hoarfrost the water of the river looked black and deep	99.63712507157271
One of the seconds went for a lantern in a coalbarge near and by its light they examined the weapons	166.8670511348293
The presidents sword which was simply as he had said one he carried in his cane was five inches shorter than the generals and had no guard	128.63505717033732
The general proposed to cast lots for the swords but the president said it was he who had given the provocation and when he had given it he had supposed each would use his own arms	93.73335254061301
The witnesses endeavored to insist but the president bade them be silent	202.541236192909
The lantern was placed on the ground the two adversaries took their stations and the duel began	109.48390425780913
The light made the two swords appear like flashes of lightning as for the men they were scarcely perceptible the darkness was so great	149.8998769696954
General dpinay passed for one of the best swordsmen in the army but he was pressed so closely in the onset that he missed his aim and fell	81.55539406600492
The witnesses thought he was dead but his adversary who knew he had not struck him offered him the assistance of his hand to rise	75.7909474773899
The circumstance irritated instead of calming the general and he rushed on his adversary	177.6606096167943
But his opponent did not allow his guard to be broken	54.27073311332259
He received him on his sword and three times the general drew back on finding himself too closely engaged and then returned to the charge	71.22046207271964
At the third he fell again	84.31291250685582
They thought he slipped as at first and the witnesses seeing he did not move approached and endeavored to raise him but the one who passed his arm around the body found it was moistened with blood	98.03352216719088
The general who had almost fainted revived	2737.603862533121
Ah said he they have sent some fencingmaster to fight with me	145.10646149115152
The president without answering approached the witness who held the lantern and raising his sleeve showed him two wounds he had received in his arm then opening his coat and unbuttoning his waistcoat displayed his side pierced with a third wound	82.20831328410829
Still he had not even uttered a sigh	151.28121895843478
General dpinay died five minutes after	21.82584017253897
Franz read these last words in a voice so choked that they were hardly audible and then stopped passing his hand over his eyes as if to dispel a cloud but after a moments silence he continued	51.936242274804776
The president went up the steps after pushing his sword into his cane a track of blood on the snow marked his course	107.1166991410131
He had scarcely arrived at the top when he heard a heavy splash in the waterit was the generals body which the witnesses had just thrown into the river after ascertaining that he was dead	90.39805472853394
The general fell then in a loyal duel and not in ambush as it might have been reported	161.10602582615687
In proof of this we have signed this paper to establish the truth of the facts lest the moment should arrive when either of the actors in this terrible scene should be accused of premeditated murder or of infringement of the laws of honor	125.81270747151957
When Franz had finished reading this account so dreadful for a son when Valentine pale with emotion had wiped away a tear when Villefort trembling and crouched in a corner had endeavored to lessen the storm by supplicating glances at the implacable old man	170.30225936821313
Sir said dpinay to Noirtier since you are well acquainted with all these details which are attested by honorable signaturessince you appear to take some interest in me although you have only manifested it hitherto by causing me sorrow refuse me not one final satisfactiontell me the name of the president of the club that I may at least know who killed my father	126.21959059860409
Villefort mechanically felt for the handle of the door Valentine who understood sooner than anyone her grandfathers answer and who had often seen two scars upon his right arm drew back a few steps	87.5601644904792
Mademoiselle said Franz turning towards Valentine unite your efforts with mine to find out the name of the man who made me an orphan at two years of age	60.57443352986692
Hold sir said Villefort do not prolong this dreadful scene	154.41727601279538
The names have been purposely concealed my father himself does not know who this president was and if he knows he can not tell you proper names are not in the dictionary	91.24468708041222
Oh misery cried Franz the only hope which sustained me and enabled me to read to the end was that of knowing at least the name of him who killed my father Sir sir cried he turning to Noirtier do what you canmake me understand in some way	111.37689353339852
Oh mademoiselle mademoiselle cried Franz your grandfather says he can indicate the person	150.0738649715152
Franz took it with a nervous trembling and repeated the letters of the alphabet successively until he came to M	133.8077908591442
At that letter the old man signified Yes	185.2457465863658
The young mans finger glided over the words but at each one Noirtier answered by a negative sign	136.987631696644
Valentine hid her head between her hands	4.512705995801809
At length Franz arrived at the word MYSELF	841.7756319123187
You cried Franz whose hair stood on end you M	57.00283213060801
Yes replied Noirtier fixing a majestic look on the young man	21.037003885826174
Franz fell powerless on a chair Villefort opened the door and escaped for the idea had entered his mind to stifle the little remaining life in the heart of this terrible old man	48.25812058087442
Cavalcanti the elder had returned to his service not in the army of his majesty the Emperor of Austria but at the gamingtable of the baths of Lucca of which he was one of the most assiduous courtiers	95.94068561457401
He had spent every farthing that had been allowed for his journey as a reward for the majestic and solemn manner in which he had maintained his assumed character of father	101.4718565810725
Andrea at his departure inherited all the papers which proved that he had indeed the honor of being the son of the Marquis Bartolomeo and the Marchioness Oliva Corsinari	60.115735605941474
He was now fairly launched in that Parisian society which gives such ready access to foreigners and treats them not as they really are but as they wish to be considered	218.7626801338071
Besides what is required of a young man in Paris To speak its language tolerably to make a good appearance to be a good gamester and to pay in cash	100.69270049106521
They are certainly less particular with a foreigner than with a Frenchman	88.83766827354737
Andrea had then in a fortnight attained a very fair position	406.5499990454375
He was called count he was said to possess 50000 livres per annum and his fathers immense riches buried in the quarries of Saravezza were a constant theme	221.91905479819368
A learned man before whom the last circumstance was mentioned as a fact declared he had seen the quarries in question which gave great weight to assertions hitherto somewhat doubtful but which now assumed the garb of reality	271.4385852416873
Such was the state of society in Paris at the period we bring before our readers when Monte Cristo went one evening to pay M	95.97477458168386
Danglars was out but the count was asked to go and see the baroness and he accepted the invitation	51.97405204194088
It was never without a nervous shudder since the dinner at Auteuil and the events which followed it that Madame Danglars heard Monte Cristos name announced	94.39906492681534
If he did not come the painful sensation became most intense if on the contrary he appeared his noble countenance his brilliant eyes his amiability his polite attention even towards Madame Danglars soon dispelled every impression of fear	228.55035577833422
It appeared impossible to the baroness that a man of such delightfully pleasing manners should entertain evil designs against her besides the most corrupt minds only suspect evil when it would answer some interested enduseless injury is repugnant to every mind	698.9083897594896
When Monte Cristo entered the boudoir to which we have already once introduced our readers and where the baroness was examining some drawings which her daughter passed to her after having looked at them with M	95.64260515013304
Cavalcanti his presence soon produced its usual effect and it was with smiles that the baroness received the count although she had been a little disconcerted at the announcement of his name	75.25479119500702
The latter took in the whole scene at a glance	82.82801564986313
The baroness was partially reclining on a sofa Eugnie sat near her and Cavalcanti was standing	66.50065423608002
Cavalcanti dressed in black like one of Goethes heroes with varnished shoes and white silk openworked stockings passed a white and tolerably nicelooking hand through his light hair and so displayed a sparkling diamond that in spite of Monte Cristos advice the vain young man had been unable to resist putting on his little finger	181.7692977454916
This movement was accompanied by killing glances at Mademoiselle Danglars and by sighs launched in the same direction	136.60359610113682
Mademoiselle Danglars was still the samecold beautiful and satirical	2946.7730368606294
Not one of these glances nor one sigh was lost on her they might have been said to fall on the shield of Minerva which some philosophers assert protected sometimes the breast of Sappho	251.84981124606935
Eugnie bowed coldly to the count and availed herself of the first moment when the conversation became earnest to escape to her study whence very soon two cheerful and noisy voices being heard in connection with occasional notes of the piano assured Monte Cristo that Mademoiselle Danglars preferred to his society and to that of M	146.8820903104133
Cavalcanti the company of Mademoiselle Louise dArmilly her singing teacher	536.1836373366756
It was then especially while conversing with Madame Danglars and apparently absorbed by the charm of the conversation that the count noticed M	75.39401745223192
Andrea Cavalcantis solicitude his manner of listening to the music at the door he dared not pass and of manifesting his admiration	100.63132055680231
His first look was certainly directed towards Monte Cristo but the second was for Andrea	46.63828983533007
As for his wife he bowed to her as some husbands do to their wives but in a way that bachelors will never comprehend until a very extensive code is published on conjugal life	441.09925475153136
Have not the ladies invited you to join them at the piano said Danglars to Andrea	56.06899333826556
Alas no sir replied Andrea with a sigh still more remarkable than the former ones	48.11779402825813
Danglars immediately advanced towards the door and opened it	9.020687567083716
The two young ladies were seen seated on the same chair at the piano accompanying themselves each with one hand a fancy to which they had accustomed themselves and performed admirably	151.50116614406926
Mademoiselle dArmilly whom they then perceived through the open doorway formed with Eugnie one of the tableaux vivants of which the Germans are so fond	216.9606039333824
She was somewhat beautiful and exquisitely formeda little fairylike figure with large curls falling on her neck which was rather too long as Perugino sometimes makes his Virgins and her eyes dull from fatigue	367.0956139280308
She was said to have a weak chest and like Antonia in the Cremona Violin she would die one day while singing	486.5019564764259
Monte Cristo cast one rapid and curious glance round this sanctum it was the first time he had ever seen Mademoiselle dArmilly of whom he had heard much	72.76929410972883
Well said the banker to his daughter are we then all to be excluded	247.29706712291505
He then led the young man into the study and either by chance or manuvre the door was partially closed after Andrea so that from the place where they sat neither the Count nor the baroness could see anything but as the banker had accompanied Andrea Madame Danglars appeared to take no notice of it	94.97912913136922
The count soon heard Andreas voice singing a Corsican song accompanied by the piano	226.64069696302528
While the count smiled at hearing this song which made him lose sight of Andrea in the recollection of Benedetto Madame Danglars was boasting to Monte Cristo of her husbands strength of mind who that very morning had lost three or four hundred thousand francs by a failure at Milan	93.52313168136942
The praise was well deserved for had not the count heard it from the baroness or by one of those means by which he knew everything the barons countenance would not have led him to suspect it	66.70999105096139
Hem thought Monte Cristo he begins to conceal his losses a month since he boasted of them	206.78390433817248
Danglars is so skilful he will soon regain at the Bourse what he loses elsewhere	389.28048303513697
I see that you participate in a prevalent error said Madame Danglars	123.00023509287162
What is it said Monte Cristo	1.0000802278539767
Danglars speculates whereas he never does	3666.3752062629605
Debray told meapropos what has become of him I have seen nothing of him the last three or four days	22.725027119326093
Nor I said Madame Danglars but you began a sentence sir and did not finish	149.56992892317103
Ah yes he told me it was you who sacrificed to the demon of speculation	102.71672895367352
I was once very fond of it but I do not indulge now	37.33779847836909
Fortune is precarious and if I were a woman and fate had made me a bankers wife whatever might be my confidence in my husbands good fortune still in speculation you know there is great risk	173.54176665985622
Well I would secure for myself a fortune independent of him even if I acquired it by placing my interests in hands unknown to him	191.31740687008718
Madame Danglars blushed in spite of all her efforts	23.25917050148669
Stay said Monte Cristo as though he had not observed her confusion I have heard of a lucky hit that was made yesterday on the Neapolitan bonds	120.98083315425963
I have nonenor have I ever possessed any but really we have talked long enough of money count we are like two stockbrokers have you heard how fate is persecuting the poor Villeforts	226.2026265632483
What has happened said the count simulating total ignorance	10178.831409370714
You know the Marquis of SaintMran died a few days after he had set out on his journey to Paris and the marchioness a few days after her arrival	59.615480866287186
Yes said Monte Cristo I have heard that but as Claudius said to Hamlet it is a law of nature their fathers died before them and they mourned their loss they will die before their children who will in their turn grieve for them	172.05813138501492
No they were going to marry their daughter	118.71973003740801
Yesterday morning it appears Franz declined the honor	214.47432840821182
Indeed And is the reason known	1634.4072081987324
How extraordinary And how does M	155.11888723149764
Danglars returned at this moment alone	1581.0850978164306
Well said the baroness do you leave M	25.823100761250313
And Mademoiselle dArmilly said the banker do you consider her no one Then turning to Monte Cristo he said Prince Cavalcanti is a charming young man is he not But is he really a prince	67.67645255681792
I will not answer for it said Monte Cristo	6.988100053290817
His father was introduced to me as a marquis so he ought to be a count but I do not think he has much claim to that title	56.98592613004254
If he is a prince he is wrong not to maintain his rank I do not like anyone to deny his origin	87.09210175262068
Oh you are a thorough democrat said Monte Cristo smiling	29.478456752532566
But do you see to what you are exposing yourself said the baroness	44.47049724431232
de Morcerf came he would find M	435.54782419631874
Cavalcanti in that room where he the betrothed of Eugnie has never been admitted	96.28548353007356
You may well say perchance replied the banker for he comes so seldom it would seem only chance that brings him	216.96381526121522
But should he come and find that young man with your daughter he might be displeased	84.99469557144155
Albert would not do us the honor to be jealous he does not like Eugnie sufficiently	82.0306929570423
Besides I care not for his displeasure	3703.682882758608
Yes do you know how we are situated At his mothers ball he danced once with Eugnie and M	197.17161039134803
Cavalcanti three times and he took no notice of it	21.765008156702546
The valet announced the Vicomte Albert de Morcerf	21.287151624863288
The baroness rose hastily and was going into the study when Danglars stopped her	49.121593242684
She looked at him in amazement	87.31347757405656
Monte Cristo appeared to be unconscious of what passed	641.3039590183911
Albert entered looking very handsome and in high spirits	88.16127600344359
He bowed politely to the baroness familiarly to Danglars and affectionately to Monte Cristo	118.0146476534608
Then turning to the baroness May I ask how Mademoiselle Danglars is said he	82.6135318096978
She is quite well replied Danglars quickly she is at the piano with M	45.51122523442612
Albert retained his calm and indifferent manner he might feel perhaps annoyed but he knew Monte Cristos eye was on him	104.9195166685678
Cavalcanti has a fine tenor voice said he and Mademoiselle Eugnie a splendid soprano and then she plays the piano like Thalberg	325.8230229134825
The concert must be a delightful one	214.82427242541974
They suit each other remarkably well said Danglars	42.8559855880609
Albert appeared not to notice this remark which was however so rude that Madame Danglars blushed	186.94865910864024
I too said the young man am a musicianat least my masters used to tell me so but it is strange that my voice never would suit any other and a soprano less than any	147.857461122635
Danglars smiled and seemed to say It is of no consequence	101.64302650097173
Then hoping doubtless to effect his purpose he saidThe prince and my daughter were universally admired yesterday	556.0575909451187
You were not of the party M	610.2827106442734
Prince Cavalcanti said Danglars who persisted in giving the young man that title	128.92099146255185
Pardon me said Albert I was not aware that he was a prince	33.10168880253745
And Prince Cavalcanti sang with Mademoiselle Eugnie yesterday It must have been charming indeed	141.4196786154217
I regret not having heard them	56.769682164702175
But I was unable to accept your invitation having promised to accompany my mother to a German concert given by the Baroness of ChteauRenaud	236.36321498316698
This was followed by rather an awkward silence	398.5239896849728
May I also be allowed said Morcerf to pay my respects to Mademoiselle Danglars	37.8475349038949
Wait a moment said the banker stopping the young man do you hear that delightful cavatina Ta ta ta ti ta ti ta ta it is charming let them finishone moment	480.33011366942424
Bravo bravi brava The banker was enthusiastic in his applause	157.63111714345675
Indeed said Albert it is exquisite it is impossible to understand the music of his country better than Prince Cavalcanti does	104.9865979908621
You said prince did you not But he can easily become one if he is not already it is no uncommon thing in Italy	107.54669670844959
But to return to the charming musiciansyou should give us a treat Danglars without telling them there is a stranger	257.5592764728356
Ask them to sing one more song it is so delightful to hear music in the distance when the musicians are unrestrained by observation	211.74201839538782
Danglars was quite annoyed by the young mans indifference	71.39886241428023
What do you think of our lover said he	67.23318546114092
But then your word is given	1247.9817823601252
Yes doubtless I have promised to give my daughter to a man who loves her but not to one who does not	41.15649611271483
See him there cold as marble and proud like his father	126.37164387095237
If he were rich if he had Cavalcantis fortune that might be pardoned	293.9956119088766
Ma foi I have nt consulted my daughter but if she has good taste	146.35218684670608
Oh said Monte Cristo my fondness may blind me but I assure you I consider Morcerf a charming young man who will render your daughter happy and will sooner or later attain a certain amount of distinction and his fathers position is good	124.47008209178556
The pastthat obscurity on the past	1582.4585825900806
But that does not affect the son	45.13646855062119
Now I beg of you do nt go off your head	131.31758604103322
Its a month now that you have been thinking of this marriage and you must see that it throws some responsibility on me for it was at my house you met this young Cavalcanti whom I do not really know at all	54.22940506397582
Is there any need of that Does not his appearance speak for him And he is very rich	122.876426601074
I am not so sure of that	22.36475690139399
And yet you said he had money	419.2028256901687
Hem said Monte Cristo in his turn	3.970661298900886
Come count you do not do that young man justice	128.06172312657048
Well I acknowledge it annoys me knowing your connection with the Morcerf family to see him throw himself in the way	85.66008749315088
What a Puritan you are said he that happens every day	113.66592813705954
But you can not break it off in this way the Morcerfs are depending on this union	133.25959606116587
Then let them explain themselves you should give the father a hint you are so intimate with the family	116.57484088558762
Iwhere the devil did you find out that	114.45545838928943
At their ball it was apparent enough	1808.98239328251
Why did not the countess the proud Mercds the disdainful Catalane who will scarcely open her lips to her oldest acquaintances take your arm lead you into the garden into the private walks and remain there for half an hour	190.0426545805233
Ah baron baron said Albert you are not listeningwhat barbarism in a megalomaniac like you	308.6173265960116
Oh do nt worry about me Sir Mocker said Danglars then turning to Monte Cristo he said	59.619667650471506
But will you undertake to speak to the father	43.26494343513521
But let it be done explicitly and positively	6216.069566908085
If he demands my daughter let him fix the daydeclare his conditions in short let us either understand each other or quarrel	264.2740404747373
Yes sir I will give my attention to the subject	28.592897698306732
I do not say that I await with pleasure his decision but I do await it	140.44837394959177
A banker must you know be a slave to his promise	186.73500975801576
Cavalcanti had done half an hour before	2.8885184376437367
Bravi bravo brava cried Morcerf parodying the banker as the selection came to an end	223.90593312383467
Danglars began to look suspiciously at Morcerf when someone came and whispered a few words to him	57.96983920330198
I shall soon return said the banker to Monte Cristo wait for me	25.923037054815406
I shall perhaps have something to say to you	14.847445288572452
The baroness took advantage of her husbands absence to push open the door of her daughters study and M	114.24112352444467
Andrea who was sitting before the piano with Mademoiselle Eugnie started up like a jackinthebox	91.9868492084742
Albert bowed with a smile to Mademoiselle Danglars who did not appear in the least disturbed and returned his bow with her usual coolness	46.85352416311871
Cavalcanti was evidently embarrassed he bowed to Morcerf who replied with the most impertinent look possible	114.0466806742544
Then Albert launched out in praise of Mademoiselle Danglars voice and on his regret after what he had just heard that he had been unable to be present the previous evening	69.9860032692971
Cavalcanti being left alone turned to Monte Cristo	8.159960573276576
Come said Madame Danglars leave music and compliments and let us go and take tea	175.32639961157273
Come Louise said Mademoiselle Danglars to her friend	24.10532788038686
They passed into the next drawingroom where tea was prepared	190.81608576565785
Just as they were beginning in the English fashion to leave the spoons in their cups the door again opened and Danglars entered visibly agitated	166.91973473209444
Monte Cristo observed it particularly and by a look asked the banker for an explanation	68.68694549595179
I have just received my courier from Greece said Danglars	264.7635607093726
Ah yes said the count that was the reason of your running away from us	55.230530632444115
How is King Otho getting on asked Albert in the most sprightly tone	100.21146554962327
Danglars cast another suspicious look towards him without answering and Monte Cristo turned away to conceal the expression of pity which passed over his features but which was gone in a moment	43.23009794072954
We shall go together shall we not said Albert to the count	26.88597589312507
If you like replied the latter	175.16294379323043
Albert could not understand the bankers look and turning to Monte Cristo who understood it perfectlyDid you see said he how he looked at me	107.6052574337824
Yes said the count but did you think there was anything particular in his look	92.18406601359585
Indeed I did and what does he mean by his news from Greece	192.43854012528516
Because I imagine you have correspondents in that country	226.4768714790586
Stop said Albert here he comes	1386.5921964655395
I shall compliment Mademoiselle Danglars on her cameo while the father talks to you	177.2280659610977
If you compliment her at all let it be on her voice at least said Monte Cristo	49.631459837301435
My dear viscount you are dreadfully impertinent	9243.414770852196
Meanwhile Danglars stooping to Monte Cristos ear Your advice was excellent said he there is a whole history connected with the names Fernand and Yanina	220.94851885656624
Yes I will tell you all but take away the young man I can not endure his presence	56.31265359973479
Shall I send the father to you	11.81916527976259
The count made a sign to Albert and they bowed to the ladies and took their leave Albert perfectly indifferent to Mademoiselle Danglars contempt Monte Cristo reiterating his advice to Madame Danglars on the prudence a bankers wife should exercise in providing for the future	128.69993034850322
Cavalcanti remained master of the field	9278.172203777245
Scarcely had the counts horses cleared the angle of the boulevard when Albert turning towards the count burst into a loud fit of laughtermuch too loud in fact not to give the idea of its being rather forced and unnatural	101.77235486090544
Well said he I will ask you the same question which Charles IX	184.5903952794414
put to Catherine de Medici after the massacre of Saint Bartholomew How have I played my little part	226.45938773863503
To what do you allude asked Monte Cristo	11.713803955050416
To the installation of my rival at M	464.8411885773796
Ma foi what rival Why your protg M	452.38963612334896
Ah no joking viscount if you please I do not patronize M	47.59881133725559
Andreaat least not as concerns M	362.0705301095621
And you would be to blame for not assisting him if the young man really needed your help in that quarter but happily for me he can dispense with it	161.2370298830026
What do you think he is paying his addresses	440.096959533532
I am certain of it his languishing looks and modulated tones when addressing Mademoiselle Danglars fully proclaim his intentions	1770.5081615916602
He aspires to the hand of the proud Eugnie	58.704879464807675
What does that signify so long as they favor your suit	248.72921452550955
But it is not the case my dear count on the contrary	22.814741170688055
I am repulsed on all sides	8.05839773495763
It is so indeed Mademoiselle Eugnie scarcely answers me and Mademoiselle dArmilly her confidant does not speak to me at all	117.1103974894146
But the father has the greatest regard possible for you said Monte Cristo	42.37883301667235
He Oh no he has plunged a thousand daggers into my heart tragedyweapons I own which instead of wounding sheathe their points in their own handles but daggers which he nevertheless believed to be real and deadly	425.94170057639406
True but I am not jealous	2274.661664120415
Of me I will engage to say that before a week is past the door will be closed against me	65.40003330427737
You are mistaken my dear viscount	22.297361334148643
Do you wish me to do so	8.230621913369374
Well I am charged with the commission of endeavoring to induce the Comte de Morcerf to make some definite arrangement with the baron	85.71989808029636
Oh said Albert with all the cajolery of which he was capable	66.66478398391887
You surely will not do that my dear count	31.43511647935709
Certainly I shall Albert as I have promised to do it	18.125164499333717
Well said Albert with a sigh it seems you are determined to marry me	44.27169276717597
I am determined to try and be on good terms with everybody at all events said Monte Cristo	34.36055663410043
But apropos of Debray how is it that I have not seen him lately at the barons house	35.597605388371086
Ah that is a good joke	1639.99217067169
Do you think he suspects said Monte Cristo with charming artlessness	74.6037246259631
Where have you come from my dear count said Albert	19.173175023338306
It must be farther off than even that	148.8590938911622
But what do I know of your Parisian husbands	333.4383787616233
Oh my dear count husbands are pretty much the same everywhere an individual husband of any country is a pretty fair specimen of the whole race	217.0030074571754
But then what can have led to the quarrel between Danglars and Debray They seemed to understand each other so well said Monte Cristo with renewed energy	66.77782841256463
Ah now you are trying to penetrate into the mysteries of Isis in which I am not initiated	148.60816426381572
Andrea Cavalcanti has become one of the family you can ask him that question	29.658689245299943
Here we are said Monte Cristo it is only halfpast ten oclock come in	33.77139646819268
My carriage shall take you back	292.83527582665516
No thank you I gave orders for my coup to follow me	85.59917207562998
There it is then said Monte Cristo as he stepped out of the carriage	18.054447568833442
They both went into the house the drawingroom was lighted upthey went in there	280.5698314678636
You will make tea for us Baptistin said the count	11.569827875824364
Baptistin left the room without waiting to answer and in two seconds reappeared bringing on a tray all that his master had ordered ready prepared and appearing to have sprung from the ground like the repasts which we read of in fairy tales	209.3650833588655
Really my dear count said Morcerf what I admire in you is not so much your riches for perhaps there are people even wealthier than yourself nor is it only your wit for Beaumarchais might have possessed as muchbut it is your manner of being served without any questions in a moment in a second it is as if they guessed what you wanted by your manner of ringing and made a point of keeping everything you can possibly desire in constant readiness	181.2049450865452
What you say is perhaps true they know my habits	304.3534288360767
For instance you shall see how do you wish to occupy yourself during teatime	164.1524311618281
Ma foi I should like to smoke	146.51090842742443
Monte Cristo took the gong and struck it once	41.9222764428896
In about the space of a second a private door opened and Ali appeared bringing two chibouques filled with excellent latakia	201.60276934327433
It is quite wonderful said Albert	150.72430675299904
Oh no it is as simple as possible replied Monte Cristo	35.3657945073788
Ali knows I generally smoke while I am taking my tea or coffee he has heard that I ordered tea and he also knows that I brought you home with me when I summoned him he naturally guessed the reason of my doing so and as he comes from a country where hospitality is especially manifested through the medium of smoking he naturally concludes that we shall smoke in company and therefore brings two chibouques instead of oneand now the mystery is solved	205.51430330556474
Certainly you give a most commonplace air to your explanation but it is not the less true that youAh but what do I hear and Morcerf inclined his head towards the door through which sounds seemed to issue resembling those of a guitar	148.7367862299402
Ma foi my dear viscount you are fated to hear music this evening you have only escaped from Mademoiselle Danglars piano to be attacked by Haydes guzla	197.9284289254807
Haydewhat an adorable name Are there then really women who bear the name of Hayde anywhere but in Byrons poems	313.4998385785633
Hayde is a very uncommon name in France but is common enough in Albania and Epirus it is as if you said for example Chastity Modesty Innocenceit is a kind of baptismal name as you Parisians call it	249.41151084543927
Oh that is charming said Albert how I should like to hear my countrywomen called Mademoiselle Goodness Mademoiselle Silence Mademoiselle Christian Charity Only think then if Mademoiselle Danglars instead of being called ClaireMarieEugnie had been named Mademoiselle ChastityModestyInnocence Danglars what a fine effect that would have produced on the announcement of her marriage	340.8265058739352
Hush said the count do not joke in so loud a tone Hayde may hear you perhaps	111.65009404379711
And you think she would be angry	35.56068675868284
No certainly not said the count with a haughty expression	11.946199122344037
She is very amiable then is she not said Albert	64.23406418122052
It is not to be called amiability it is her duty a slave does not dictate to a master	155.3308711978679
Come you are joking yourself now	156.23087137788943
Are there any more slaves to be had who bear this beautiful name	125.74609880150635
Really count you do nothing and have nothing like other people	150.70563942978623
The slave of the Count of Monte Cristo Why it is a rank of itself in France and from the way in which you lavish money it is a place that must be worth a hundred thousand francs a year	31.276463058786863
A hundred thousand francs The poor girl originally possessed much more than that she was born to treasures in comparison with which those recorded in the Thousand and One Nights would seem but poverty	219.56963692787346
She must be a princess then	118.00597559563707
You are right and she is one of the greatest in her country too	60.54514747949044
But how did it happen that such a great princess became a slave	135.5308995194001
How was it that Dionysius the Tyrant became a schoolmaster The fortune of war my dear viscountthe caprice of fortune that is the way in which these things are to be accounted for	180.2659290350087
And is her name a secret	85.35726207668029
As regards the generality of mankind it is but not for you my dear viscount who are one of my most intimate friends and on whose silence I feel I may rely if I consider it necessary to enjoin itmay I not do so	98.6944913577972
Certainly on my word of honor	3.7218732530471326
You know the history of the Pasha of Yanina do you not	22.57317558843676
Of Ali Tepelini13 Oh yes it was in his service that my father made his fortune	55.565068437631346
Well what is Hayde to Ali Tepelini	59.438255396629415
What the daughter of Ali Pasha	1.631413697542371
Of Ali Pasha and the beautiful Vasiliki	1275.7952484239775
But how did she become so	118.447333878191
Why simply from the circumstance of my having bought her one day as I was passing through the market at Constantinople	87.5944673954697
Wonderful Really my dear count you seem to throw a sort of magic influence over all in which you are concerned when I listen to you existence no longer seems reality but a waking dream	155.1591517398429
Now I am perhaps going to make an imprudent and thoughtless request but	300.29644384142915
But since you go out with Hayde and sometimes even take her to the Opera	115.82961974050332
I think I may venture to ask you this favor	32.35111071049102
You may venture to ask me anything	26.13022983913548
Well then my dear count present me to your princess	147.62803458524257
I will do so but on two conditions	590.3914450748555
The first is that you will never tell anyone that I have granted the interview	69.55739989104144
Very well said Albert extending his hand I swear I will not	18.507561453323394
The second is that you will not tell her that your father ever served hers	122.6855118145969
I give you my oath that I will not	13.243405489499604
Enough viscount you will remember those two vows will you not But I know you to be a man of honor	43.82779019106987
The count again struck the gong	20056.606830356683
Tell Hayde said he that I will take coffee with her and give her to understand that I desire permission to present one of my friends to her	55.32495717923021
Ali bowed and left the room	2.3468203701542287
Now understand me said the count no direct questions my dear Morcerf if you wish to know anything tell me and I will ask her	54.08651021087834
Ali reappeared for the third time and drew back the tapestried hanging which concealed the door to signify to his master and Albert that they were at liberty to pass on	58.46087337024266
Let us go in said Monte Cristo	2.4969827382270395
Albert passed his hand through his hair and curled his moustache then having satisfied himself as to his personal appearance followed the count into the room the latter having previously resumed his hat and gloves	74.49297734455902
Ali was stationed as a kind of advanced guard and the door was kept by the three French attendants commanded by Myrtho	232.44881795107386
Hayde was awaiting her visitors in the first room of her apartments which was the drawingroom	45.06282625109057
Her large eyes were dilated with surprise and expectation for it was the first time that any man except Monte Cristo had been accorded an entrance into her presence	74.285431802041
She was sitting on a sofa placed in an angle of the room with her legs crossed under her in the Eastern fashion and seemed to have made for herself as it were a kind of nest in the rich Indian silks which enveloped her	94.32648062369782
Near her was the instrument on which she had just been playing it was elegantly fashioned and worthy of its mistress	147.17025479147915
On perceiving Monte Cristo she arose and welcomed him with a smile peculiar to herself expressive at once of the most implicit obedience and also of the deepest love	155.0957443937594
Monte Cristo advanced towards her and extended his hand which she as usual raised to her lips	64.84963214566741
Albert had proceeded no farther than the door where he remained rooted to the spot being completely fascinated by the sight of such surpassing beauty beheld as it was for the first time and of which an inhabitant of more northern climes could form no adequate idea	150.8991110260776
Whom do you bring asked the young girl in Romaic of Monte Cristo is it a friend a brother a simple acquaintance or an enemy	60.22556547194643
A friend said Monte Cristo in the same language	17.865365295339906
Count Albert it is the same man whom I rescued from the hands of the banditti at Rome	42.59530160600912
In what language would you like me to converse with him	63.85931442056413
Do you know modern Greek asked he	15.631003916166973
Alas no said Albert nor even ancient Greek my dear count never had Homer or Plato a more unworthy scholar than myself	412.53060799276375
Then said Hayde proving by her remark that she had quite understood Monte Cristos question and Alberts answer then I will speak either in French or Italian if my lord so wills it	161.15492074085455
You will speak in Italian said he	10.167344701099477
Then turning towards AlbertIt is a pity you do not understand either ancient or modern Greek both of which Hayde speaks so fluently the poor child will be obliged to talk to you in Italian which will give you but a very false idea of her powers of conversation	111.49759483848084
The count made a sign to Hayde to address his visitor	108.40543403467814
Sir she said to Morcerf you are most welcome as the friend of my lord and master	68.49355239392483
This was said in excellent Tuscan and with that soft Roman accent which makes the language of Dante as sonorous as that of Homer	198.69365852788948
Then turning to Ali she directed him to bring coffee and pipes and when he had left the room to execute the orders of his young mistress she beckoned Albert to approach nearer to her	95.66349812514603
Monte Cristo and Morcerf drew their seats towards a small table on which were arranged music drawings and vases of flowers	161.89740288835492
Ali then entered bringing coffee and chibouques as to M	127.07860256412422
Baptistin this portion of the building was interdicted to him	287.7841725318284
Albert refused the pipe which the Nubian offered him	264.331686890167
Oh take ittake it said the count Hayde is almost as civilized as a Parisian the smell of a Havana is disagreeable to her but the tobacco of the East is a most delicious perfume you know	145.92316495537992
The cups of coffee were all prepared with the addition of sugar which had been brought for Albert	61.61707906760775
Monte Cristo and Hayde took the beverage in the original Arabian manner that is to say without sugar	140.57506051607828
Hayde took the porcelain cup in her little slender fingers and conveyed it to her mouth with all the innocent artlessness of a child when eating or drinking something which it likes	117.75289802324976
At this moment two women entered bringing salvers filled with ices and sherbet which they placed on two small tables appropriated to that purpose	302.360580590169
My dear host and you signora said Albert in Italian excuse my apparent stupidity	785.5241581882477
I am quite bewildered and it is natural that it should be so	27.605215537984115
Here I am in the heart of Paris but a moment ago I heard the rumbling of the omnibuses and the tinkling of the bells of the lemonadesellers and now I feel as if I were suddenly transported to the East not such as I have seen it but such as my dreams have painted it	104.30343597684985
Oh signora if I could but speak Greek your conversation added to the fairyscene which surrounds me would furnish an evening of such delight as it would be impossible for me ever to forget	195.11643482385531
I speak sufficient Italian to enable me to converse with you sir said Hayde quietly and if you like what is Eastern I will do my best to secure the gratification of your tastes while you are here	69.90061293872611
On what subject shall I converse with her said Albert in a low tone to Monte Cristo	23.523425410570702
Just what you please you may speak of her country and of her youthful reminiscences or if you like it better you can talk of Rome Naples or Florence	125.18330814265377
Oh said Albert it is of no use to be in the company of a Greek if one converses just in the same style as with a Parisian let me speak to her of the East	92.96571680284764
Do so then for of all themes which you could choose that will be the most agreeable to her taste	88.35075590112905
At what age did you leave Greece signora asked he	662.425354378248
I left it when I was but five years old replied Hayde	96.56864682516495
And have you any recollection of your country	39.40376712835906
When I shut my eyes and think I seem to see it all again	57.98050982424047
The mind can see as well as the body	28.67382655537426
The body forgets sometimes but the mind always remembers	740.3137051853021
And how far back into the past do your recollections extend	902.6285283286685
I could scarcely walk when my mother who was called Vasiliki which means royal said the young girl tossing her head proudly took me by the hand and after putting in our purse all the money we possessed we went out both covered with veils to solicit alms for the prisoners saying He who giveth to the poor lendeth to the Lord	218.70920652799884
Then when our purse was full we returned to the palace and without saying a word to my father we sent it to the convent where it was divided amongst the prisoners	72.3759954451973
And how old were you at that time	95.29604590406049
I was three years old said Hayde	47.91633218068706
Then you remember everything that went on about you from the time when you were three years old said Albert	70.01526812951687
Count said Albert in a low tone to Monte Cristo do allow the signora to tell me something of her history	45.239494496622335
You prohibited my mentioning my fathers name to her but perhaps she will allude to him of her own accord in the course of the recital and you have no idea how delighted I should be to hear our name pronounced by such beautiful lips	75.01027805415002
Monte Cristo turned to Hayde and with an expression of countenance which commanded her to pay the most implicit attention to his words he said in Greek            that is Tell us the fate of your father but neither the name of the traitor nor the treason	52.78431979816574
Hayde sighed deeply and a shade of sadness clouded her beautiful brow	378.19972819049974
What are you saying to her said Morcerf in an undertone	59.25674515319328
I again reminded her that you were a friend and that she need not conceal anything from you	74.79634982337562
Then said Albert this pious pilgrimage in behalf of the prisoners was your first remembrance what is the next	152.1892521941842
Oh then I remember as if it were but yesterday sitting under the shade of some sycamoretrees on the borders of a lake in the waters of which the trembling foliage was reflected as in a mirror	97.29601765525302
Under the oldest and thickest of these trees reclining on cushions sat my father my mother was at his feet and I childlike amused myself by playing with his long white beard which descended to his girdle or with the diamondhilt of the scimitar attached to his girdle	140.43381753693072
Then from time to time there came to him an Albanian who said something to which I paid no attention but which he always answered in the same tone of voice either Kill or Pardon	100.51642672384708
It is very strange said Albert to hear such words proceed from the mouth of anyone but an actress on the stage and one needs constantly to be saying to ones self This is no fiction it is all reality in order to believe it	128.31285834815716
And how does France appear in your eyes accustomed as they have been to gaze on such enchanted scenes	106.31343380184873
I think it is a fine country said Hayde but I see France as it really is because I look on it with the eyes of a woman whereas my own country which I can only judge of from the impression produced on my childish mind always seems enveloped in a vague atmosphere which is luminous or otherwise according as my remembrances of it are sad or joyous	212.41644604213303
So young said Albert forgetting at the moment the Counts command that he should ask no questions of the slave herself is it possible that you can have known what suffering is except by name	140.855286820497
Hayde turned her eyes towards Monte Cristo who making at the same time some imperceptible sign murmured	72.16286971973673
Nothing is ever so firmly impressed on the mind as the memory of our early childhood and with the exception of the two scenes I have just described to you all my earliest reminiscences are fraught with deepest sadness	124.64190343668062
Speak speak signora said Albert I am listening with the most intense delight and interest to all you say	71.73782391812517
Hayde answered his remark with a melancholy smile	10.539250947298498
You wish me then to relate the history of my past sorrows said she	94.45953672221849
I beg you to do so replied Albert	64.87757554820536
Well I was but four years old when one night I was suddenly awakened by my mother	67.82366712282953
We were in the palace of Yanina she snatched me from the cushions on which I was sleeping and on opening my eyes I saw hers filled with tears	96.74515201370045
She took me away without speaking	42.74442473996831
When I saw her weeping I began to cry too	97.1923411496014
At other times in spite of maternal endearments or threats I had with a childs caprice been accustomed to indulge my feelings of sorrow or anger by crying as much as I felt inclined but on this occasion there was an intonation of such extreme terror in my mothers voice when she enjoined me to silence that I ceased crying as soon as her command was given	145.35760374977633
I saw then that we were descending a large staircase around us were all my mothers servants carrying trunks bags ornaments jewels purses of gold with which they were hurrying away in the greatest distraction	262.1153520729288
Behind the women came a guard of twenty men armed with long guns and pistols and dressed in the costume which the Greeks have assumed since they have again become a nation	115.31007135192571
You may imagine there was something startling and ominous said Hayde shaking her head and turning pale at the mere remembrance of the scene in this long file of slaves and women only halfaroused from sleep or at least so they appeared to me who was myself scarcely awake	157.1796453939656
Here and there on the walls of the staircase were reflected gigantic shadows which trembled in the flickering light of the pinetorches till they seemed to reach to the vaulted roof above	195.81680538618318
Quick said a voice at the end of the gallery	9.410075102185234
This voice made everyone bow before it resembling in its effect the wind passing over a field of wheat by its superior strength forcing every ear to yield obeisance	340.3110319602581
As for me it made me tremble	125.06192603441335
This voice was that of my father	30.84445842890209
He came last clothed in his splendid robes and holding in his hand the carbine which your emperor presented him	104.01369690008683
He was leaning on the shoulder of his favorite Selim and he drove us all before him as a shepherd would his straggling flock	204.06566902036286
My father said Hayde raising her head was that illustrious man known in Europe under the name of Ali Tepelini pasha of Yanina and before whom Turkey trembled	92.02968074484679
Albert without knowing why started on hearing these words pronounced with such a haughty and dignified accent it appeared to him as if there was something supernaturally gloomy and terrible in the expression which gleamed from the brilliant eyes of Hayde at this moment she appeared like a Pythoness evoking a spectre as she recalled to his mind the remembrance of the fearful death of this man to the news of which all Europe had listened with horror	87.76219402451622
Soon said Hayde we halted on our march and found ourselves on the borders of a lake	58.089333045446914
My mother pressed me to her throbbing heart and at the distance of a few paces I saw my father who was glancing anxiously around	73.02680572495467
Four marble steps led down to the waters edge and below them was a boat floating on the tide	158.20853072810166
From where we stood I could see in the middle of the lake a large blank mass it was the kiosk to which we were going	51.43106126732687
This kiosk appeared to me to be at a considerable distance perhaps on account of the darkness of the night which prevented any object from being more than partially discerned	111.86030482388465
I remember well that the oars made no noise whatever in striking the water and when I leaned over to ascertain the cause I saw that they were muffled with the sashes of our Palikares	136.7332819616451
14 Besides the rowers the boat contained only the women my father mother Selim and myself	237.23022793792603
The Palikares had remained on the shore of the lake ready to cover our retreat they were kneeling on the lowest of the marble steps and in that manner intended making a rampart of the three others in case of pursuit	107.42156224117554
Our bark flew before the wind	48.92645025666492
Why does the boat go so fast asked I of my mother	83.6474018885714
Silence child Hush we are flying I did not understand	82.83745066893283
Why should my father flyhe the allpowerfulhe before whom others were accustomed to flyhe who had taken for his device	223.39349056235105
They hate me then they fear me	156.83381609018008
It was indeed a flight which my father was trying to effect	82.01469433485661
I have been told since that the garrison of the castle of Yanina fatigued with long service	109.83274567479751
Here Hayde cast a significant glance at Monte Cristo whose eyes had been riveted on her countenance during the whole course of her narrative	44.661414778354214
The young girl then continued speaking slowly like a person who is either inventing or suppressing some feature of the history which he is relating	231.87117449062052
You were saying signora said Albert who was paying the most implicit attention to the recital that the garrison of Yanina fatigued with long service	100.97441748269252
Had treated with the Seraskier15 Kourchid who had been sent by the sultan to gain possession of the person of my father it was then that Ali Tepeliniafter having sent to the sultan a French officer in whom he reposed great confidenceresolved to retire to the asylum which he had long before prepared for himself and which he called kataphygion or the refuge	125.5012051990387
And this officer asked Albert do you remember his name signora	187.0276199417823
Monte Cristo exchanged a rapid glance with the young girl which was quite unperceived by Albert	41.555173213843275
No said she I do not remember it just at this moment but if it should occur to me presently I will tell you	32.43411853828197
Albert was on the point of pronouncing his fathers name when Monte Cristo gently held up his finger in token of reproach the young man recollected his promise and was silent	57.28340186582197
It was towards this kiosk that we were rowing	300.76584183921386
A ground floor ornamented with arabesques bathing its terraces in the water and another floor looking on the lake was all which was visible to the eye	135.7491421005625
But beneath the ground floor stretching out into the island was a large subterranean cavern to which my mother myself and the women were conducted	253.1484027229089
In this place were together 60000 pouches and 200 barrels the pouches contained 25000000 of money in gold and the barrels were filled with 30000 pounds of gunpowder	317.5622690328248
Near the barrels stood Selim my fathers favorite whom I mentioned to you just now	100.76197481240693
He stood watch day and night with a lance provided with a lighted slowmatch in his hand and he had orders to blow up everythingkiosk guards women gold and Ali Tepelini himselfat the first signal given by my father	238.71705255616723
I remember well that the slaves convinced of the precarious tenure on which they held their lives passed whole days and nights in praying crying and groaning	546.8066746908453
As for me I can never forget the pale complexion and black eyes of the young soldier and whenever the angel of death summons me to another world I am quite sure I shall recognize Selim	67.60427098350168
I can not tell you how long we remained in this state at that period I did not even know what time meant	86.72925666593237
Sometimes but very rarely my father summoned me and my mother to the terrace of the palace these were hours of recreation for me as I never saw anything in the dismal cavern but the gloomy countenances of the slaves and Selims fiery lance	157.51237611135184
My father was endeavoring to pierce with his eager looks the remotest verge of the horizon examining attentively every black speck which appeared on the lake while my mother reclining by his side rested her head on his shoulder and I played at his feet admiring everything I saw with that unsophisticated innocence of childhood which throws a charm round objects insignificant in themselves but which in its eyes are invested with the greatest importance	289.23773271748354
The heights of Pindus towered above us the castle of Yanina rose white and angular from the blue waters of the lake and the immense masses of black vegetation which viewed in the distance gave the idea of lichens clinging to the rocks were in reality gigantic firtrees and myrtles	190.65058407760046
One morning my father sent for us my mother had been crying all the night and was very wretched we found the pasha calm but paler than usual	116.9097694427141
Take courage Vasiliki said he today arrives the firman of the master and my fate will be decided	160.65406067501095
If my pardon be complete we shall return triumphant to Yanina if the news be inauspicious we must fly this night	180.8114239142845
But supposing our enemy should not allow us to do so said my mother	29.372725135232642
Oh make yourself easy on that head said Ali smiling Selim and his flaming lance will settle that matter	379.49367762465266
They would be glad to see me dead but they would not like themselves to die with me	37.56109077126495
My mother only answered by sighs to consolations which she knew did not come from my fathers heart	140.4026242838885
She prepared the iced water which he was in the habit of constantly drinkingfor since his sojourn at the kiosk he had been parched by the most violent feverafter which she anointed his white beard with perfumed oil and lighted his chibouque which he sometimes smoked for hours together quietly watching the wreaths of vapor that ascended in spiral clouds and gradually melted away in the surrounding atmosphere	254.49742381689802
Presently he made such a sudden movement that I was paralyzed with fear	103.45149097250771
Then without taking his eyes from the object which had first attracted his attention he asked for his telescope	135.1109884916798
My mother gave it him and as she did so looked whiter than the marble against which she leaned	83.84180873533928
I saw my fathers hand tremble	790.3367539994304
A boattwothree murmured my fatherfour He then arose seizing his arms and priming his pistols	163.08584916091095
Vasiliki said he to my mother trembling perceptibly the instant approaches which will decide everything	1264.652623173124
In the space of half an hour we shall know the emperors answer	55.226705650537426
Go into the cavern with Hayde	522.9591555554744
I will not quit you said Vasiliki if you die my lord I will die with you	42.783171735127404
Go to Selim cried my father	2.3257108426541686
Adieu my lord murmured my mother determining quietly to await the approach of death	241.1666103830556
Take away Vasiliki said my father to his Palikares	133.5472553930588
As for me I had been forgotten in the general confusion I ran toward Ali Tepelini he saw me hold out my arms to him and he stooped down and pressed my forehead with his lips	82.38591791976246
Oh how distinctly I remember that kissit was the last he ever gave me and I feel as if it were still warm on my forehead	93.00361122161968
On descending we saw through the latticework several boats which were gradually becoming more distinct to our view	339.15836193560034
At first they appeared like black specks and now they looked like birds skimming the surface of the waves	323.8583192342569
During this time in the kiosk at my fathers feet were seated twenty Palikares concealed from view by an angle of the wall and watching with eager eyes the arrival of the boats	131.21401567787234
They were armed with their long guns inlaid with motherofpearl and silver and cartridges in great numbers were lying scattered on the floor	229.41096900797626
My father looked at his watch and paced up and down with a countenance expressive of the greatest anguish	76.95929760147484
This was the scene which presented itself to my view as I quitted my father after that last kiss	117.3771347331429
My mother and I traversed the gloomy passage leading to the cavern	77.43133646877803
Selim was still at his post and smiled sadly on us as we entered	114.38891549367743
We fetched our cushions from the other end of the cavern and sat down by Selim	29.179828651519227
In great dangers the devoted ones cling to each other and young as I was I quite understood that some imminent danger was hanging over our heads	121.35915550768796
Albert had often heardnot from his father for he never spoke on the subject but from strangersthe description of the last moments of the vizier of Yanina he had read different accounts of his death but the story seemed to acquire fresh meaning from the voice and expression of the young girl and her sympathetic accent and the melancholy expression of her countenance at once charmed and horrified him	95.56763259772005
As to Hayde these terrible reminiscences seemed to have overpowered her for a moment for she ceased speaking her head leaning on her hand like a beautiful flower bowing beneath the violence of the storm and her eyes gazing on vacancy indicated that she was mentally contemplating the green summit of the Pindus and the blue waters of the lake of Yanina which like a magic mirror seemed to reflect the sombre picture which she sketched	124.22849594082219
Monte Cristo looked at her with an indescribable expression of interest and pity	28.599071228845098
Go on my child said the count in the Romaic language	33.517608713657424
Hayde looked up abruptly as if the sonorous tones of Monte Cristos voice had awakened her from a dream and she resumed her narrative	96.10941462460629
It was about four oclock in the afternoon and although the day was brilliant outofdoors we were enveloped in the gloomy darkness of the cavern	81.33960008346006
One single solitary light was burning there and it appeared like a star set in a heaven of blackness it was Selims flaming lance	383.22827450080507
My mother was a Christian and she prayed	231.11234078309107
Selim repeated from time to time the sacred words God is great However my mother had still some hope	166.51993883543923
As she was coming down she thought she recognized the French officer who had been sent to Constantinople and in whom my father placed so much confidence for he knew that all the soldiers of the French emperor were naturally noble and generous	64.12038821184973
She advanced some steps towards the staircase and listened	22.91685301605943
They are approaching said she perhaps they bring us peace and liberty	267.95516329163894
What do you fear Vasiliki said Selim in a voice at once so gentle and yet so proud	64.32477431184624
If they do not bring us peace we will give them war if they do not bring life we will give them death	59.57748890841972
And he renewed the flame of his lance with a gesture which made one think of Dionysus of old Crete	187.70203083583047
16 But I being only a little child was terrified by this undaunted courage which appeared to me both ferocious and senseless and I recoiled with horror from the idea of the frightful death amidst fire and flames which probably awaited us	193.2256144801502
My mother experienced the same sensations for I felt her tremble	369.5734644910807
Mamma mamma said I are we really to be killed And at the sound of my voice the slaves redoubled their cries and prayers and lamentations	125.8186483546544
My child said Vasiliki may God preserve you from ever wishing for that death which today you so much dread Then whispering to Selim she asked what were her masters orders	211.90311292602883
If he send me his poniard it will signify that the emperors intentions are not favorable and I am to set fire to the powder if on the contrary he send me his ring it will be a sign that the emperor pardons him and I am to extinguish the match and leave the magazine untouched	147.73211251115913
My friend said my mother when your masters orders arrive if it is the poniard which he sends instead of despatching us by that horrible death which we both so much dread you will mercifully kill us with this same poniard will you notYes Vasiliki replied Selim tranquilly	272.48360487548956
Suddenly we heard loud cries and listening discerned that they were cries of joy	79.95532843278706
The name of the French officer who had been sent to Constantinople resounded on all sides amongst our Palikares it was evident that he brought the answer of the emperor and that it was favorable	55.13432462040297
And do you not remember the Frenchmans name said Morcerf quite ready to aid the memory of the narrator	211.55636130541797
Monte Cristo made a sign to him to be silent	15.063143735320253
I do not recollect it said Hayde	63.88304991552595
The noise increased steps were heard approaching nearer and nearer they were descending the steps leading to the cavern	56.7663896426426
Soon a figure appeared in the gray twilight at the entrance of the cave formed by the reflection of the few rays of daylight which had found their way into this gloomy retreat	64.64731387834836
But whoever you may be I charge you not to advance another step	289.6851034791716
Long live the emperor said the figure	112.4701251150204
He grants a full pardon to the Vizier Ali and not only gives him his life but restores to him his fortune and his possessions	108.20991791242479
My mother uttered a cry of joy and clasped me to her bosom	28.909453472420847
Stop said Selim seeing that she was about to go out you see I have not yet received the ringTrue said my mother	66.8383779111095
And she fell on her knees at the same time holding me up towards heaven as if she desired while praying to God in my behalf to raise me actually to his presence	67.56972242311336
And for the second time Hayde stopped overcome by such violent emotion that the perspiration stood upon her pale brow and her stifled voice seemed hardly able to find utterance so parched and dry were her throat and lips	128.75411113017267
Monte Cristo poured a little iced water into a glass and presented it to her saying with a mildness in which was also a shade of commandCourage	87.6523426729979
Hayde dried her eyes and continued	661.7275884167738
By this time our eyes habituated to the darkness had recognized the messenger of the pashait was a friend	117.18681903291849
Selim had also recognized him but the brave young man only acknowledged one duty which was to obey	142.5699426609744
In whose name do you come said he to him	65.41151409123636
I come in the name of our master Ali Tepelini	64.47442738662609
If you come from Ali himself said Selim you know what you were charged to remit to meYes said the messenger and I bring you his ring	114.09975286826999
At these words he raised his hand above his head to show the token but it was too far off and there was not light enough to enable Selim where he was standing to distinguish and recognize the object presented to his view	105.58625437095566
I do not see what you have in your hand said Selim	37.75554287920032
Approach then said the messenger or I will come nearer to you if you prefer it	49.7782193288786
I will agree to neither one nor the other replied the young soldier place the object which I desire to see in the ray of light which shines there and retire while I examine it	84.23812190433145
Be it so said the envoy and he retired after having first deposited the token agreed on in the place pointed out to him by Selim	187.48419378092692
Oh how our hearts palpitated for it did indeed seem to be a ring which was placed there	64.35854918490195
But was it my fathers ring that was the question	104.83270853775802
Selim still holding in his hand the lighted match walked towards the opening in the cavern and aided by the faint light which streamed in through the mouth of the cave picked up the token	100.44807168714938
It is well said he kissing it it is my masters ring And throwing the match on the ground he trampled on it and extinguished it	156.54125577762233
The messenger uttered a cry of joy and clapped his hands	15.790853583849204
At this signal four soldiers of the Seraskier Kourchid suddenly appeared and Selim fell pierced by five blows	401.7153345799473
Each man had stabbed him separately and intoxicated by their crime though still pale with fear they sought all over the cavern to discover if there was any fear of fire after which they amused themselves by rolling on the bags of gold	135.0005665696793
At this moment my mother seized me in her arms and hurrying noiselessly along numerous turnings and windings known only to ourselves she arrived at a private staircase of the kiosk where was a scene of frightful tumult and confusion	221.665749966673
The lower rooms were entirely filled with Kourchids troops that is to say with our enemies	122.0380266239065
Just as my mother was on the point of pushing open a small door we heard the voice of the pasha sounding in a loud and threatening tone	71.44728894091712
My mother applied her eye to the crack between the boards I luckily found a small opening which afforded me a view of the apartment and what was passing within	133.39098431191783
What do you want said my father to some people who were holding a paper inscribed with characters of gold	119.65370364401228
What we want replied one is to communicate to you the will of his highness	79.40856830233022
Do you see this firmanI do said my father	57.23755030802744
Well read it he demands your head	75.44229598982159
My father answered with a loud laugh which was more frightful than even threats would have been and he had not ceased when two reports of a pistol were heard he had fired them himself and had killed two men	95.22723148887745
The Palikares who were prostrated at my fathers feet now sprang up and fired and the room was filled with fire and smoke	49.28617222767298
At the same instant the firing began on the other side and the balls penetrated the boards all round us	222.56298436980623
Oh how noble did the grand vizier my father look at that moment in the midst of the flying bullets his scimitar in his hand and his face blackened with the powder of his enemies and how he terrified them even then and made them fly before him Selim Selim cried he guardian of the fire do your dutySelim is dead replied a voice which seemed to come from the depths of the earth and you are lost Ali At the same moment an explosion was heard and the flooring of the room in which my father was sitting was suddenly torn up and shivered to atomsthe troops were firing from underneath	91.8011328002615
Three or four Palikares fell with their bodies literally ploughed with wounds	751.172690888478
My father howled aloud plunged his fingers into the holes which the balls had made and tore up one of the planks entire	97.76736223331827
But immediately through this opening twenty more shots were fired and the flame rushing up like fire from the crater of a volcano soon reached the tapestry which it quickly devoured	221.26857315533638
In the midst of all this frightful tumult and these terrific cries two reports fearfully distinct followed by two shrieks more heartrending than all froze me with terror	450.87745186665137
These two shots had mortally wounded my father and it was he who had given utterance to these frightful cries	61.43981058871697
However he remained standing clinging to a window	27.689181648380448
My mother tried to force the door that she might go and die with him but it was fastened on the inside	34.773527320734516
All around him were lying the Palikares writhing in convulsive agonies while two or three who were only slightly wounded were trying to escape by springing from the windows	179.74924014667738
At this crisis the whole flooring suddenly gave way my father fell on one knee and at the same moment twenty hands were thrust forth armed with sabres pistols and poniardstwenty blows were instantaneously directed against one man and my father disappeared in a whirlwind of fire and smoke kindled by these demons and which seemed like hell itself opening beneath his feet	219.26482113974163
I felt myself fall to the ground my mother had fainted	81.92694044288828
Haydes arms fell by her side and she uttered a deep groan at the same time looking towards the count as if to ask if he were satisfied with her obedience to his commands	28.069221260555413
Monte Cristo arose and approached her took her hand and said to her in Romaic	72.9850980719697
Calm yourself my dear child and take courage in remembering that there is a God who will punish traitors	188.8036947571858
It is a frightful story count said Albert terrified at the paleness of Haydes countenance and I reproach myself now for having been so cruel and thoughtless in my request	142.64184839658427
Oh it is nothing said Monte Cristo	1.4603681206043837
Then patting the young girl on the head he continued Hayde is very courageous and she sometimes even finds consolation in the recital of her misfortunes	157.13693966194492
Because my lord said Hayde eagerly my miseries recall to me the remembrance of your goodness	143.59587700144021
Albert looked at her with curiosity for she had not yet related what he most desired to knowhow she had become the slave of the count	125.05317999481555
Hayde saw at a glance the same expression pervading the countenances of her two auditors she continued	288.80007338509773
When my mother recovered her senses we were before the seraskier	419.2332269556988
Kill said she but spare the honor of the widow of Ali	28.21192531966064
It is not to me to whom you must address yourself said Kourchid	155.95607157899295
To whom thenTo your new master	39.83600138924907
Who and where is heHe is here	34.60434620884823
And Kourchid pointed out one who had more than any contributed to the death of my father said Hayde in a tone of chastened anger	41.69982402301664
Then said Albert you became the property of this man	26.473852059747614
No replied Hayde he did not dare to keep us so we were sold to some slavemerchants who were going to Constantinople	77.38787810604217
We traversed Greece and arrived half dead at the imperial gates	334.3387266837378
They were surrounded by a crowd of people who opened a way for us to pass when suddenly my mother having looked closely at an object which was attracting their attention uttered a piercing cry and fell to the ground pointing as she did so to a head which was placed over the gates and beneath which were inscribed these words	99.51333566007246
This is the head of Ali Tepelini Pasha of Yanina	29.04937804254438
I cried bitterly and tried to raise my mother from the earth but she was dead I was taken to the slavemarket and was purchased by a rich Armenian	72.45174959932612
He caused me to be instructed gave me masters and when I was thirteen years of age he sold me to the Sultan Mahmoud	198.33053954196265
Of whom I bought her said Monte Cristo as I told you Albert with the emerald which formed a match to the one I had made into a box for the purpose of holding my hashish pills	80.51604733223739
Oh you are good you are great my lord said Hayde kissing the counts hand and I am very fortunate in belonging to such a master	68.24941607345887
Albert remained quite bewildered with all that he had seen and heard	26.197584191605362
Come finish your cup of coffee said Monte Cristo the history is ended	44.14890280841014
If Valentine could have seen the trembling step and agitated countenance of Franz when he quitted the chamber of M	90.40500157021596
Noirtier even she would have been constrained to pity him	116.21206624931487
Villefort had only just given utterance to a few incoherent sentences and then retired to his study where he received about two hours afterwards the following letter	94.1487393898085
After all the disclosures which were made this morning M	101.57132402417925
Noirtier de Villefort must see the utter impossibility of any alliance being formed between his family and that of M	122.907627445893
dpinay must say that he is shocked and astonished that M	268.5076311836286
de Villefort who appeared to be aware of all the circumstances detailed this morning should not have anticipated him in this announcement	93.2999912748859
No one who had seen the magistrate at this moment so thoroughly unnerved by the recent inauspicious combination of circumstances would have supposed for an instant that he had anticipated the annoyance although it certainly never had occurred to him that his father would carry candor or rather rudeness so far as to relate such a history	136.8034892267184
And in justice to Villefort it must be understood that M	46.79995200331605
Noirtier who never cared for the opinion of his son on any subject had always omitted to explain the affair to Villefort so that he had all his life entertained the belief that General de Quesnel or the Baron dpinay as he was alternately styled according as the speaker wished to identify him by his own family name or by the title which had been conferred on him fell the victim of assassination and not that he was killed fairly in a duel	101.1686464989024
This harsh letter coming as it did from a man generally so polite and respectful struck a mortal blow at the pride of Villefort	140.3355788389947
Hardly had he read the letter when his wife entered	64.79875203983117
The sudden departure of Franz after being summoned by M	240.54480924944258
Noirtier had so much astonished everyone that the position of Madame de Villefort left alone with the notary and the witnesses became every moment more embarrassing	73.15429479478105
Determined to bear it no longer she arose and left the room saying she would go and make some inquiries into the cause of his sudden disappearance	60.74560364033216
de Villeforts communications on the subject were very limited and concise he told her in fact that an explanation had taken place between M	135.89254408099248
dpinay and himself and that the marriage of Valentine and Franz would consequently be broken off	117.81984447689042
This was an awkward and unpleasant thing to have to report to those who were waiting	153.22468434967286
She therefore contented herself with saying that M	288.0978090924025
Noirtier having at the commencement of the discussion been attacked by a sort of apoplectic fit the affair would necessarily be deferred for some days longer	121.3926075019827
This news false as it was following so singularly in the train of the two similar misfortunes which had so recently occurred evidently astonished the auditors and they retired without a word	207.65989707833327
During this time Valentine at once terrified and happy after having embraced and thanked the feeble old man for thus breaking with a single blow the chain which she had been accustomed to consider as irrefragable asked leave to retire to her own room in order to recover her composure	127.35568047212557
Noirtier looked the permission which she solicited	392.03370131520603
But instead of going to her own room Valentine having once gained her liberty entered the gallery and opening a small door at the end of it found herself at once in the garden	70.12620981876351
In the midst of all the strange events which had crowded one on the other an indefinable sentiment of dread had taken possession of Valentines mind	99.71177939471752
She expected every moment that she should see Morrel appear pale and trembling to forbid the signing of the contract like the Laird of Ravenswood in The Bride of Lammermoor	112.88652267418678
It was high time for her to make her appearance at the gate for Maximilian had long awaited her coming	60.22272350447791
He had half guessed what was going on when he saw Franz quit the cemetery with M	81.44354674734565
dpinay saw him enter afterwards go out and then reenter with Albert and ChteauRenaud	99.26721492625173
He had no longer any doubts as to the nature of the conference he therefore quickly went to the gate in the cloverpatch prepared to hear the result of the proceedings and very certain that Valentine would hasten to him the first moment she should be set at liberty	75.57955219936409
He was not mistaken peering through the crevices of the wooden partition he soon discovered the young girl who cast aside all her usual precautions and walked at once to the barrier	51.330295376216895
The first glance which Maximilian directed towards her entirely reassured him and the first words she spoke made his heart bound with delight	127.93101497243451
Saved repeated Morrel not being able to conceive such intense happiness by whom	138.29388577419053
Oh Morrel pray love him for all his goodness to us	75.36678905181134
Morrel swore to love him with all his soul and at that moment he could safely promise to do so for he felt as though it were not enough to love him merely as a friend or even as a father he worshiped him as a god	58.89537321965887
But tell me Valentine how has it all been effected What strange means has he used to compass this blessed end	361.600252127747
Valentine was on the point of relating all that had passed but she suddenly remembered that in doing so she must reveal a terrible secret which concerned others as well as her grandfather and she said	110.11796817125709
At some future time I will tell you all about it	10.966599588529975
The conversation had now turned upon a topic so pleasing to Morrel that he was ready to accede to anything that Valentine thought fit to propose and he likewise felt that a piece of intelligence such as he just heard ought to be more than sufficient to content him for one day	113.61892768189445
However he would not leave without the promise of seeing Valentine again the next night	76.89002320350102
Valentine promised all that Morrel required of her and certainly it was less difficult now for her to believe that she should marry Maximilian than it was an hour ago to assure herself that she should not marry Franz	71.10330862962478
During the time occupied by the interview we have just detailed Madame de Villefort had gone to visit M	40.655777102477394
The old man looked at her with that stern and forbidding expression with which he was accustomed to receive her	60.89159984923164
Sir said she it is superfluous for me to tell you that Valentines marriage is broken off since it was here that the affair was concluded	55.27687713788388
But one thing I can tell you of which I do not think you are aware that is that I have always been opposed to this marriage and that the contract was entered into entirely without my consent or approbation	53.30670164520366
Noirtier regarded his daughterinlaw with the look of a man desiring an explanation	55.82204856385147
Now that this marriage which I know you so much disliked is done away with I come to you on an errand which neither M	123.7377524052573
de Villefort nor Valentine could consistently undertake	81263.15991550098
Noirtiers eyes demanded the nature of her mission	41.08591390791925
I come to entreat you sir continued Madame de Villefort as the only one who has the right of doing so inasmuch as I am the only one who will receive no personal benefit from the transactionI come to entreat you to restore not your love for that she has always possessed but to restore your fortune to your granddaughter	95.20812661267573
There was a doubtful expression in Noirtiers eyes he was evidently trying to discover the motive of this proceeding and he could not succeed in doing so	65.69122505933106
May I hope sir said Madame de Villefort that your intentions accord with my request	55.96265565629054
Noirtier made a sign that they did	51.189843997924875
In that case sir rejoined Madame de Villefort I will leave you overwhelmed with gratitude and happiness at your prompt acquiescence to my wishes	81.49001592903055
Noirtier sent for the notary the first will was torn up and a second made in which he left the whole of his fortune to Valentine on condition that she should never be separated from him	69.65701800453589
It was then generally reported that Mademoiselle de Villefort the heiress of the marquis and marchioness of SaintMran had regained the good graces of her grandfather and that she would ultimately be in possession of an income of 300000 livres	70.97846017494642
While all the proceedings relative to the dissolution of the marriagecontract were being carried on at the house of M	71.41215605889262
de Villefort Monte Cristo had paid his visit to the Count of Morcerf who in order to lose no time in responding to M	29.74040950384437
Danglars wishes and at the same time to pay all due deference to his position in society donned his uniform of lieutenantgeneral which he ornamented with all his crosses and thus attired ordered his finest horses and drove to the Rue de la Chausse dAntin	79.61658896524727
Danglars was balancing his monthly accounts and it was perhaps not the most favorable moment for finding him in his best humor	110.90984474038918
At the first sight of his old friend Danglars assumed his majestic air and settled himself in his easychair	101.17162694679148
Morcerf usually so stiff and formal accosted the banker in an affable and smiling manner and feeling sure that the overture he was about to make would be well received he did not consider it necessary to adopt any manuvres in order to gain his end but went at once straight to the point	140.74712705115596
Well baron said he here I am at last some time has elapsed since our plans were formed and they are not yet executed	63.968693139668304
Morcerf paused at these words quietly waiting till the cloud should have dispersed which had gathered on the brow of Danglars and which he attributed to his silence but on the contrary to his great surprise it grew darker and darker	117.28208544163942
To what do you allude monsieur said Danglars as if he were trying in vain to guess at the possible meaning of the generals words	67.51099065937568
Ah said Morcerf I see you are a stickler for forms my dear sir and you would remind me that the ceremonial rites should not be omitted	172.3208101672352
Ma foi I beg your pardon but as I have but one son and it is the first time I have ever thought of marrying him I am still serving my apprenticeship you know come I will reform	57.185291560422414
And Morcerf with a forced smile arose and making a low bow to M	34.38138039232482
Baron I have the honor of asking of you the hand of Mademoiselle Eugnie Danglars for my son the Vicomte Albert de Morcerf	61.21713089448512
But Danglars instead of receiving this address in the favorable manner which Morcerf had expected knit his brow and without inviting the count who was still standing to take a seat he said	85.02952795131313
Monsieur it will be necessary to reflect before I give you an answer	71.04683100881824
To reflect said Morcerf more and more astonished have you not had enough time for reflection during the eight years which have elapsed since this marriage was first discussed between us	115.2316040699824
Count said the banker things are constantly occurring in the world to induce us to lay aside our most established opinions or at all events to cause us to remodel them according to the change of circumstances which may have placed affairs in a totally different light to that in which we at first viewed them	152.42535263677047
I do not understand you baron said Morcerf	175.89406319516624
What I mean to say is this sirthat during the last fortnight unforeseen circumstances have occurred	299.6467116695334
Excuse me said Morcerf but is it a play we are acting	216.45974343929774
Yes for it is like one pray let us come more to the point and endeavor thoroughly to understand each other	176.66638876407455
de Monte Cristo have you not	14.24918082392049
I see him very often said Danglars drawing himself up he is a particular friend of mine	71.62746240798486
Well in one of your late conversations with him you said that I appeared to be forgetful and irresolute concerning this marriage did you not	175.7812492012425
Well here I am proving at once that I am really neither the one nor the other by entreating you to keep your promise on that score	80.95433589442864
Have you so soon changed your mind added Morcerf or have you only provoked my request that you may have the pleasure of seeing me humbled	89.76879404649844
Danglars seeing that if he continued the conversation in the same tone in which he had begun it the whole thing might turn out to his own disadvantage turned to Morcerf and said	79.89495839388864
Count you must doubtless be surprised at my reserve and I assure you it costs me much to act in such a manner towards you but believe me when I say that imperative necessity has imposed the painful task upon me	112.76754194195993
These are all so many empty words my dear sir said Morcerf they might satisfy a new acquaintance but the Comte de Morcerf does not rank in that list and when a man like him comes to another recalls to him his plighted word and this man fails to redeem the pledge he has at least a right to exact from him a good reason for so doing	172.06519256347352
Danglars was a coward but did not wish to appear so he was piqued at the tone which Morcerf had just assumed	69.30888748182302
I am not without a good reason for my conduct replied the banker	62.32823229414366
What do you mean to say	19.305758945946955
I mean to say that I have a good reason but that it is difficult to explain	34.10584932166898
You must be aware at all events that it is impossible for me to understand motives before they are explained to me but one thing at least is clear which is that you decline allying yourself with my family	80.39684783073498
No sir said Danglars I merely suspend my decision that is all	260.64957230809483
And do you really flatter yourself that I shall yield to all your caprices and quietly and humbly await the time of again being received into your good graces	219.36516516397305
Then count if you will not wait we must look upon these projects as if they had never been entertained	59.39615921908707
The count bit his lips till the blood almost started to prevent the ebullition of anger which his proud and irritable temper scarcely allowed him to restrain understanding however that in the present state of things the laugh would decidedly be against him he turned from the door towards which he had been directing his steps and again confronted the banker	139.7861125647713
A cloud settled on his brow evincing decided anxiety and uneasiness instead of the expression of offended pride which had lately reigned there	373.2705967202271
My dear Danglars said Morcerf we have been acquainted for many years and consequently we ought to make some allowance for each others failings	86.14567576985255
You owe me an explanation and really it is but fair that I should know what circumstance has occurred to deprive my son of your favor	113.32821309471704
It is from no personal illfeeling towards the viscount that is all I can say sir replied Danglars who resumed his insolent manner as soon as he perceived that Morcerf was a little softened and calmed down	81.88389379447663
And towards whom do you bear this personal illfeeling then said Morcerf turning pale with anger	93.70579644697469
The expression of the counts face had not remained unperceived by the banker he fixed on him a look of greater assurance than before and said	125.03422397115916
You may perhaps be better satisfied that I should not go farther into particulars	150.79830807079009
A tremor of suppressed rage shook the whole frame of the count and making a violent effort over himself he said I have a right to insist on your giving me an explanation	45.636039729146255
Is it Madame de Morcerf who has displeased you Is it my fortune which you find insufficient Is it because my opinions differ from yours	212.74687139421164
Nothing of the kind sir replied Danglars if such had been the case I only should have been to blame inasmuch as I was aware of all these things when I made the engagement	72.97673880867545
No do not seek any longer to discover the reason	56.674209869951966
I really am quite ashamed to have been the cause of your undergoing such severe selfexamination let us drop the subject and adopt the middle course of delay which implies neither a rupture nor an engagement	281.7900563933282
Ma foi there is no hurry	220.30014698689897
My daughter is only seventeen years old and your son twentyone	133.50193399264128
While we wait time will be progressing events will succeed each other things which in the evening look dark and obscure appear but too clearly in the light of morning and sometimes the utterance of one word or the lapse of a single day will reveal the most cruel calumnies	169.52203262838427
Calumnies did you say sir cried Morcerf turning livid with rage	67.08337795561835
Does anyone dare to slander me	24.38917729924896
Monsieur I told you that I considered it best to avoid all explanation	127.22677858122726
Then sir I am patiently to submit to your refusal	116.48770159809393
Yes sir although I assure you the refusal is as painful for me to give as it is for you to receive for I had reckoned on the honor of your alliance and the breaking off of a marriage contract always injures the lady more than the gentleman	103.62584329914492
Enough sir said Morcerf we will speak no more on the subject	24.708305048868862
And clutching his gloves in anger he left the apartment	42.026683342371456
Danglars observed that during the whole conversation Morcerf had never once dared to ask if it was on his own account that Danglars recalled his word	75.66567598572603
That evening he had a long conference with several friends and M	139.23285173220822
Cavalcanti who had remained in the drawingroom with the ladies was the last to leave the bankers house	38.21545732737896
The next morning as soon as he awoke Danglars asked for the newspapers they were brought to him he laid aside three or four and at last fixed on lImpartial the paper of which Beauchamp was the chief editor	92.20309603076133
He hastily tore off the cover opened the journal with nervous precipitation passed contemptuously over the Paris jottings and arriving at the miscellaneous intelligence stopped with a malicious smile at a paragraph headed	416.9537619669307
Very good observed Danglars after having read the paragraph here is a little article on Colonel Fernand which if I am not mistaken would render the explanation which the Comte de Morcerf required of me perfectly unnecessary	111.74069758029404
At the same moment that is at nine oclock in the morning Albert de Morcerf dressed in a black coat buttoned up to his chin might have been seen walking with a quick and agitated step in the direction of Monte Cristos house in the Champslyses	28.969787824048826
When he presented himself at the gate the porter informed him that the Count had gone out about half an hour previously	37.45087787176232
Did he take Baptistin with him	7.152069410954315
Call him then I wish to speak to him	7.406821586052603
The concierge went to seek the valet de chambre and returned with him in an instant	26.604864623982262
My good friend said Albert I beg pardon for my intrusion but I was anxious to know from your own mouth if your master was really out or not	90.98719797516448
He is really out sir replied Baptistin	137.3483663360761
I know how happy my master always is to receive the vicomte said Baptistin and I should therefore never think of including him in any general order	215.1943459073184
You are right and now I wish to see him on an affair of great importance	35.530386182820244
Do you think it will be long before he comes in	66.35827554247597
No I think not for he ordered his breakfast at ten oclock	115.83726936005918
Well I will go and take a turn in the Champslyses and at ten oclock I will return here meanwhile if the count should come in will you beg him not to go out again without seeing me	50.903191837020394
You may depend on my doing so sir said Baptistin	242.66397458173404
Albert left the cab in which he had come at the counts door intending to take a turn on foot	29.517720079319062
As he was passing the Alle des Veuves he thought he saw the counts horses standing at Gossets shootinggallery he approached and soon recognized the coachman	286.8291995721805
Is the count shooting in the gallery said Morcerf	73.79217915951187
While he was speaking Albert had heard the report of two or three pistolshots	48.470825799689194
He entered and on his way met the waiter	130.97251772410974
Excuse me my lord said the lad but will you have the kindness to wait a moment	64.73435820785252
What for Philip asked Albert who being a constant visitor there did not understand this opposition to his entrance	116.47071461682474
Because the person who is now in the gallery prefers being alone and never practices in the presence of anyone	187.98906247703474
Not even before you Philip Then who loads his pistol	1381.7853815264614
Yes and I am come to look for him he is a friend of mine	28.280991037856257
Oh that is quite another thing then	34.28683388843984
I will go immediately and inform him of your arrival	114.22819261440378
And Philip urged by his own curiosity entered the gallery a second afterwards Monte Cristo appeared on the threshold	89.63743483646623
I ask your pardon my dear count said Albert for following you here and I must first tell you that it was not the fault of your servants that I did so I alone am to blame for the indiscretion	52.70121663984896
I went to your house and they told me you were out but that they expected you home at ten oclock to breakfast	54.94071662353232
I was walking about in order to pass away the time till ten oclock when I caught sight of your carriage and horses	56.83516701275871
What you have just said induces me to hope that you intend breakfasting with me	133.73878890747045
No thank you I am thinking of other things besides breakfast just now perhaps we may take that meal at a later hour and in worse company	283.9959624711083
What on earth are you talking of	103.95660879384543
Yes I understand that but what is the quarrel People fight for all sorts of reasons you know	159.7992885203264
I fight in the cause of honor	30.44477567603995
So serious that I come to beg you to render me a service	41.16378114797689
That is a serious matter and we will not discuss it here let us speak of nothing till we get home	77.05418266436173
The count turned up his sleeves and passed into the little vestibule where the gentlemen were accustomed to wash their hands after shooting	239.662596447679
Come in my lord said Philip in a low tone and I will show you something droll	76.22857367183731
Morcerf entered and in place of the usual target he saw some playingcards fixed against the wall	152.53426254599128
At a distance Albert thought it was a complete suit for he counted from the ace to the ten	100.4843962085243
Ah ha said Albert I see you were preparing for a game of cards	71.43751466362272
No said the count I was making a suit	209.0485185016562
Those are really aces and twos which you see but my shots have turned them into threes fives sevens eights nines and tens	1377.6769959606256
In fact the bullets had actually pierced the cards in the exact places which the painted signs would otherwise have occupied the lines and distances being as regularly kept as if they had been ruled with pencil	336.5204619455642
In going up to the target Morcerf picked up two or three swallows that had been rash enough to come within the range of the counts pistol	175.16549177444188
What would you have my dear viscount said Monte Cristo wiping his hands on the towel which Ali had brought him I must occupy my leisure moments in some way or other	54.837931034915755
But come I am waiting for you	9.174487111620943
Both men entered Monte Cristos carriage which in the course of a few minutes deposited them safely at No	73.44122935644435
Monte Cristo took Albert into his study and pointing to a seat placed another for himself	49.5363869810424
Now let us talk the matter over quietly said the count	113.22230752954822
You see I am perfectly composed said Albert	272.74386845363534
With whom are you going to fight	30.660211295826503
Of course it is always with friends that one fights	498.66899036501377
I suppose you have some cause of quarrel	120.45259449182859
What has he done to you	17.64136467950224
There appeared in his journal last nightbut wait and read for yourself	588.5589950587452
And Albert handed over the paper to the count who read as follows	33.772658231713834
A correspondent at Yanina informs us of a fact of which until now we had remained in ignorance	159.04268136148477
The castle which formed the protection of the town was given up to the Turks by a French officer named Fernand in whom the grand vizier Ali Tepelini had reposed the greatest confidence	76.94478191754187
Well said Monte Cristo what do you see in that to annoy you	33.45167619490777
What do I see in it	74.74858678784842
Yes what does it signify to you if the castle of Yanina was given up by a French officer	38.5217711487549
It signifies to my father the Count of Morcerf whose Christian name is Fernand	49.05979432891659
Did your father serve under Ali Pasha	176.82905501428053
Yes that is to say he fought for the independence of the Greeks and hence arises the calumny	461.1958000631526
Oh my dear viscount do talk reason	12204.94459368786
I do not desire to do otherwise	87.63330338670806
Now just tell me who the devil should know in France that the officer Fernand and the Count of Morcerf are one and the same person and who cares now about Yanina which was taken as long ago as the year 1822 or 1823	125.73861429641879
That just shows the meanness of this slander	167.47564318399733
They have allowed all this time to elapse and then all of a sudden rake up events which have been forgotten to furnish materials for scandal in order to tarnish the lustre of our high position	177.91178081777198
I inherit my fathers name and I do not choose that the shadow of disgrace should darken it	84.87496149675684
I am going to Beauchamp in whose journal this paragraph appears and I shall insist on his retracting the assertion before two witnesses	448.88188907442515
No you will not for he will tell you what is very true that perhaps there were fifty officers in the Greek army bearing the same name	74.08758371464464
I will efface that blot on my fathers character	41.621402124012214
My father who was such a brave soldier whose career was so brilliant	96.25080384248673
Oh well he will add We are warranted in believing that this Fernand is not the illustrious Count of Morcerf who also bears the same Christian name	191.2425976103707
I am determined not to be content with anything short of an entire retractation	306.07016758325926
And you intend to make him do it in the presence of two witnesses do you	32.338069531140015
Which means I suppose that you refuse the service which I asked of you	96.90005465745168
You know my theory regarding duels I told you my opinion on that subject if you remember when we were at Rome	76.08255358019046
Nevertheless my dear count I found you this morning engaged in an occupation but little consistent with the notions you profess to entertain	291.2508254184814
Because my dear fellow you understand one must never be eccentric	213.78922334307885
If ones lot is cast among fools it is necessary to study folly	237.7578141722196
I shall perhaps find myself one day called out by some harebrained scamp who has no more real cause of quarrel with me than you have with Beauchamp he may take me to task for some foolish trifle or other he will bring his witnesses or will insult me in some public place and I am expected to kill him for all that	116.65159818613436
You admit that you would fight then Well if so why do you object to my doing so	135.79191526678395
I do not say that you ought not to fight I only say that a duel is a serious thing and ought not to be undertaken without due reflection	79.06757416057023
Did he reflect before he insulted my father	214.2679630225585
If he spoke hastily and owns that he did so you ought to be satisfied	80.37318519072976
Ah my dear count you are far too indulgent	100.96759599410082
And you are far too exacting	3924.1468796909667
Supposing for instance and do not be angry at what I am going to say	15.759847488421782
Supposing the assertion to be really true	868.7989827049576
A son ought not to submit to such a stain on his fathers honor	134.60212789790344
Ma foi we live in times when there is much to which we must submit	105.73676447882252
That is precisely the fault of the age	32.36686232787818
And do you undertake to reform it	638.1660363373072
Yes as far as I am personally concerned	594.5492022205415
Well you are indeed exacting my dear fellow	27.141051700815915
Are you quite impervious to good advice	275.4132404123791
Not when it comes from a friend	47.842571905277765
And do you account me that title	117.94420770867656
Well then before going to Beauchamp with your witnesses seek further information on the subject	227.9711239813799
Why what can be the use of mixing a woman up in the affairwhat can she do in it	223.1584333435691
She can declare to you for example that your father had no hand whatever in the defeat and death of the vizier or if by chance he had indeed the misfortune to	72.63782638299196
I have told you my dear count that I would not for one moment admit of such a proposition	47.41775517952603
You reject this means of information then	388.1860250143345
Then let me offer one more word of advice	221.97554270620273
Do so then but let it be the last	44.79269139816173
You do not wish to hear it perhaps	179.20020826713662
On the contrary I request it	22.72272762672578
Do not take any witnesses with you when you go to Beauchampvisit him alone	140.8300727115253
That would be contrary to all custom	1616.0530112615802
Your case is not an ordinary one	128.36278903163773
And what is your reason for advising me to go alone	68.31794995335387
Because then the affair will rest between you and Beauchamp	129.84633950271328
If Beauchamp be disposed to retract you ought at least to give him the opportunity of doing it of his own free willthe satisfaction to you will be the same	71.51542773542938
If on the contrary he refuses to do so it will then be quite time enough to admit two strangers into your secret	150.33795637802083
They will not be strangers they will be friends	36.661440989733904
Ah but the friends of today are the enemies of tomorrow Beauchamp for instance	180.4245698228413
I recommend you to be prudent	17066.553780229722
Then you advise me to go alone to Beauchamp	73.78525207297915
I do and I will tell you why	18.616383867182805
When you wish to obtain some concession from a mans selflove you must avoid even the appearance of wishing to wound it	203.77313306692662
Go but you would do better still by not going at all	281.97835370956136
Do so then it will be a wiser plan than the first which you proposed	128.28154907566486
But if in spite of all my precautions I am at last obliged to fight will you not be my second	82.72277614774954
My dear viscount said Monte Cristo gravely you must have seen before today that at all times and in all places I have been at your disposal but the service which you have just demanded of me is one which it is out of my power to render you	55.16843675702337
Perhaps you may know at some future period and in the mean time I request you to excuse my declining to put you in possession of my reasons	95.83946066035783
Well I will have Franz and ChteauRenaud they will be the very men for it	79.87731542979763
But if I do fight you will surely not object to giving me a lesson or two in shooting and fencing	257.3157208689666
What a singular being you areyou will not interfere in anything	276.6135091611084
You are rightthat is the principle on which I wish to act	83.32114400282748
We will say no more about it then	15.300719742463684
Morcerf took his hat and left the room	11.918102909826416
He found his carriage at the door and doing his utmost to restrain his anger he went at once to find Beauchamp who was in his office	50.94664547441622
It was a gloomy dustylooking apartment such as journalists offices have always been from time immemorial	741.4221804489025
Beauchamp repeated the name to himself as though he could scarcely believe that he had heard aright and then gave orders for him to be admitted	42.164074233689426
Beauchamp uttered an exclamation of surprise on seeing his friend leap over and trample under foot all the newspapers which were strewed about the room	285.99730140971184
This way this way my dear Albert said he holding out his hand to the young man	11.551738040149447
Are you out of your senses or do you come peaceably to take breakfast with me Try and find a seatthere is one by that geranium which is the only thing in the room to remind me that there are other leaves in the world besides leaves of paper	150.54013897773342
Beauchamp said Albert it is of your journal that I come to speak	84.07558023382387
Indeed What do you wish to say about it	22.80377164445617
I desire that a statement contained in it should be rectified	223.7492282691941
To what do you refer But pray sit down	741.1425818912868
Thank you said Albert with a cold and formal bow	234.37529972185592
Will you now have the kindness to explain the nature of the statement which has displeased you	78.61811714358862
An announcement has been made which implicates the honor of a member of my family	63.08063837450848
What is it said Beauchamp much surprised surely you must be mistaken	224.99153150916712
The story sent you from Yanina	117.25531679949766
Yes really you appear to be totally ignorant of the cause which brings me here	69.7489138013248
Such is really the case I assure you upon my honor Baptiste give me yesterdays paper cried Beauchamp	264.51084401431666
Here I have brought mine with me replied Albert	65.26135406165834
Beauchamp took the paper and read the article to which Albert pointed in an undertone	69.34370688985429
You see it is a serious annoyance said Morcerf when Beauchamp had finished the perusal of the paragraph	115.17882425971047
Is the officer referred to a relation of yours then demanded the journalist	227.9060440538868
Well what do you wish me to do for you said Beauchamp mildly	38.51230804801109
My dear Beauchamp I wish you to contradict this statement	125.42735143708731
Beauchamp looked at Albert with a benevolent expression	49.318336004439644
Come said he this matter will want a good deal of talking over a retractation is always a serious thing you know	156.51873069802156
Sit down and I will read it again	64.4174635470067
Albert resumed his seat and Beauchamp read with more attention than at first the lines denounced by his friend	124.85497146935475
Well said Albert in a determined tone you see that your paper has insulted a member of my family and I insist on a retractation being made	98.26395279534151
Permit me to remind you that you are not in the Chamber my dear viscount	31.08170409458175
Nor do I wish to be there replied the young man rising	20.80746024899714
I repeat that I am determined to have the announcement of yesterday contradicted	187.77359826454602
You have known me long enough continued Albert biting his lips convulsively for he saw that Beauchamps anger was beginning to riseyou have been my friend and therefore sufficiently intimate with me to be aware that I am likely to maintain my resolution on this point	115.30948561352132
If I have been your friend Morcerf your present manner of speaking would almost lead me to forget that I ever bore that title	327.34097702347265
But wait a moment do not let us get angry or at least not yet	71.66998160554958
You are irritated and vexedtell me how this Fernand is related to you	83.86499666324411
He is merely my father said AlbertM	2656.9039156349563
Fernand Mondego Count of Morcerf an old soldier who has fought in twenty battles and whose honorable scars they would denounce as badges of disgrace	422.08037515069253
Is it your father said Beauchamp that is quite another thing	57.91125316707825
Then I can well understand your indignation my dear Albert	201.78275694700213
I will look at it again and he read the paragraph for the third time laying a stress on each word as he proceeded	102.59671319481626
But the paper nowhere identifies this Fernand with your father	114.71766599911723
No but the connection will be seen by others and therefore I will have the article contradicted	108.85991013552
At the words I will Beauchamp steadily raised his eyes to Alberts countenance and then as gradually lowering them he remained thoughtful for a few moments	164.75531835212297
You will retract this assertion will you not Beauchamp said Albert with increased though stifled anger	224.2942014581126
When I am convinced that the statement is false	144.8668259891387
The thing is worth looking into and I will take pains to investigate the matter thoroughly	237.99428169258823
But what is there to investigate sir said Albert enraged beyond measure at Beauchamps last remark	923.248842836479
If you do not believe that it is my father say so immediately and if on the contrary you believe it to be him state your reasons for doing so	95.31600342657944
Beauchamp looked at Albert with the smile which was so peculiar to him and which in its numerous modifications served to express every varied emotion of his mind	117.50055118518111
Sir replied he if you came to me with the idea of demanding satisfaction you should have gone at once to the point and not have entertained me with the idle conversation to which I have been patiently listening for the last half hour	60.763827355681116
Am I to put this construction on your visit	210.51950748787695
Yes if you will not consent to retract that infamous calumny	1491.6111761065665
Wait a momentno threats if you please M	15.391542854435906
Fernand Mondego Vicomte de Morcerf I never allow them from my enemies and therefore shall not put up with them from my friends	69.45785134387955
You insist on my contradicting the article relating to General Fernand an article with which I assure you on my word of honor I had nothing whatever to do	65.7724652362154
Yes I insist on it said Albert whose mind was beginning to get bewildered with the excitement of his feelings	78.94471086318443
And if I refuse to retract you wish to fight do you said Beauchamp in a calm tone	54.28131621412554
Yes replied Albert raising his voice	68.07516932861213
Well said Beauchamp here is my answer my dear sir	63.96962769149725
The article was not inserted by meI was not even aware of it but you have by the step you have taken called my attention to the paragraph in question and it will remain until it shall be either contradicted or confirmed by someone who has a right to do so	70.78161701228979
Sir said Albert rising I will do myself the honor of sending my seconds to you and you will be kind enough to arrange with them the place of meeting and the weapons	43.41105616421563
And this evening if you please or tomorrow at the latest we will meet	85.63942769708655
No no I will be on the ground at the proper time but in my opinion and I have a right to dictate the preliminaries as it is I who have received the provocationin my opinion the time ought not to be yet	73.08387240781758
I know you to be well skilled in the management of the sword while I am only moderately so I know too that you are a good marksmanthere we are about equal	126.18948965457872
I know that a duel between us two would be a serious affair because you are brave and I am brave also	73.77202023488915
I do not therefore wish either to kill you or to be killed myself without a cause	77.25078091338233
Now I am going to put a question to you and one very much to the purpose too	119.86550838088414
Do you insist on this retractation so far as to kill me if I do not make it although I have repeated more than once and affirmed on my honor that I was ignorant of the thing with which you charge me and although I still declare that it is impossible for anyone but you to recognize the Count of Morcerf under the name of Fernand	47.96082726471714
Very well my dear sir then I consent to cut throats with you	332.540904681023
But I require three weeks preparation at the end of that time I shall come and say to you The assertion is false and I retract it or The assertion is true when I shall immediately draw the sword from its sheath or the pistols from the case whichever you please	107.062011703862
Three weeks cried Albert they will pass as slowly as three centuries when I am all the time suffering dishonor	207.99091547027984
Had you continued to remain on amicable terms with me I should have said Patience my friend but you have constituted yourself my enemy therefore I say What does that signify to me sir	108.29060220878294
Well let it be three weeks then said Morcerf but remember at the expiration of that time no delay or subterfuge will justify you in	147.19201059705267
Albert de Morcerf said Beauchamp rising in his turn I can not throw you out of window for three weeksthat is to say for twentyfour days to comenor have you any right to split my skull open till that time has elapsed	113.26641289041176
Today is the 29th of August the 21st of September will therefore be the conclusion of the term agreed on and till that time arrivesand it is the advice of a gentleman which I am about to give youtill then we will refrain from growling and barking like two dogs chained within sight of each other	175.39703283150166
When he had concluded his speech Beauchamp bowed coldly to Albert turned his back upon him and went to the pressroom	127.48268024668258
Albert vented his anger on a pile of newspapers which he sent flying all over the office by switching them violently with his stick after which ebullition he departednot however without walking several times to the door of the pressroom as if he had half a mind to enter	200.3663954004771
While Albert was lashing the front of his carriage in the same manner that he had the newspapers which were the innocent agents of his discomfiture as he was crossing the barrier he perceived Morrel who was walking with a quick step and a bright eye	62.91767437728358
He was passing the Chinese Baths and appeared to have come from the direction of the Porte SaintMartin and to be going towards the Madeleine	86.00903990209694
Ah said Morcerf there goes a happy man And it so happened Albert was not mistaken in his opinion	144.56159800132983
Morrel was in fact very happy	56.92242613481388
Noirtier had just sent for him and he was in such haste to know the reason of his doing so that he had not stopped to take a cab placing infinitely more dependence on his own two legs than on the four legs of a cabhorse	71.13937412917807
He had therefore set off at a furious rate from the Rue Meslay and was hastening with rapid strides in the direction of the Faubourg SaintHonor	48.22065721850491
Morrel advanced with a firm manly tread and poor Barrois followed him as he best might	273.49585511425767
Morrel was only thirtyone Barrois was sixty years of age Morrel was deeply in love and Barrois was dying with heat and exertion	71.94090401703767
These two men thus opposed in age and interests resembled two parts of a triangle presenting the extremes of separation yet nevertheless possessing their point of union	470.62435895185376
This point of union was Noirtier and it was he who had just sent for Morrel with the request that the latter would lose no time in coming to hima command which Morrel obeyed to the letter to the great discomfiture of Barrois	65.54711245232289
On arriving at the house Morrel was not even out of breath for love lends wings to our desires but Barrois who had long forgotten what it was to love was sorely fatigued by the expedition he had been constrained to use	157.98141052138783
The old servant introduced Morrel by a private entrance closed the door of the study and soon the rustling of a dress announced the arrival of Valentine	67.96275506174237
She looked marvellously beautiful in her deep mourning dress and Morrel experienced such intense delight in gazing upon her that he felt as if he could almost have dispensed with the conversation of her grandfather	91.76538437767654
But the easychair of the old man was heard rolling along the floor and he soon made his appearance in the room	47.146251735467445
Noirtier acknowledged by a look of extreme kindness and benevolence the thanks which Morrel lavished on him for his timely intervention on behalf of Valentine and himselfan intervention which had saved them from despair	267.21743251983537
Morrel then cast on the invalid an interrogative look as to the new favor which he designed to bestow on him	155.22529555603822
Valentine was sitting at a little distance from them timidly awaiting the moment when she should be obliged to speak	57.40476099190355
Noirtier fixed his eyes on her	41.91660338675315
Am I to say what you told me asked Valentine	22.233697192979594
Noirtier made a sign that she was to do so	16.786862720480368
Monsieur Morrel said Valentine to the young man who was regarding her with the most intense interest my grandfather M	43.83843378579218
Noirtier had a thousand things to say which he told me three days ago and now he has sent for you that I may repeat them to you	31.03738522323768
I will repeat them then and since he has chosen me as his interpreter I will be faithful to the trust and will not alter a word of his intentions	81.73869381415487
Oh I am listening with the greatest impatience replied the young man speak I beg of you	36.22536029767635
Valentine cast down her eyes this was a good omen for Morrel for he knew that nothing but happiness could have the power of thus overcoming Valentine	89.22870638203177
My grandfather intends leaving this house said she and Barrois is looking out for suitable apartments for him in another	170.40222827311368
But you Mademoiselle de Villefortyou who are necessary to M	58.70837760279005
I interrupted Valentine I shall not leave my grandfatherthat is an understood thing between us	130.6591385844144
My apartment will be close to his	13.919826521533107
de Villefort must either give his consent to this plan or his refusal in the first case I shall leave directly and in the second I shall wait till I am of age which will be in about ten months	61.35858789327921
Then I shall be free I shall have an independent fortune and	49.19748567989653
And with my grandfathers consent I shall fulfil the promise which I have made you	33.84721795927531
Valentine pronounced these last few words in such a low tone that nothing but Morrels intense interest in what she was saying could have enabled him to hear them	64.43357291916789
Have I not explained your wishes grandpapa said Valentine addressing Noirtier	215.7257361466667
Once under my grandfathers roof M	275.0879052540405
Morrel can visit me in the presence of my good and worthy protector if we still feel that the union we contemplated will be likely to insure our future comfort and happiness in that case I shall expect M	131.46540648505297
Morrel to come and claim me at my own hands	30.848733542536635
But alas I have heard it said that hearts inflamed by obstacles to their desire grew cold in time of security I trust we shall never find it so in our experience	275.40398199568443
Oh cried Morrel almost tempted to throw himself on his knees before Noirtier and Valentine and to adore them as two superior beings what have I ever done in my life to merit such unbounded happiness	96.61802875350025
Until that time continued the young girl in a calm and selfpossessed tone of voice we will conform to circumstances and be guided by the wishes of our friends so long as those wishes do not tend finally to separate us in a word and I repeat it because it expresses all I wish to conveywe will wait	149.97568564713845
And I swear to make all the sacrifices which this word imposes sir said Morrel not only with resignation but with cheerfulness	367.94689497533756
Therefore continued Valentine looking playfully at Maximilian no more inconsiderate actionsno more rash projects for you surely would not wish to compromise one who from this day regards herself as destined honorably and happily to bear your name	368.87908154077985
Morrel looked obedience to her commands	1177.6482936722127
Noirtier regarded the lovers with a look of ineffable tenderness while Barrois who had remained in the room in the character of a man privileged to know everything that passed smiled on the youthful couple as he wiped the perspiration from his bald forehead	68.7104930694319
How hot you look my good Barrois said Valentine	57.77626263790355
Ah I have been running very fast mademoiselle but I must do M	145.25718338655335
Morrel the justice to say that he ran still faster	337.90736424689294
Noirtier directed their attention to a waiter on which was placed a decanter containing lemonade and a glass	122.37362512552235
The decanter was nearly full with the exception of a little which had been already drunk by M	61.60472391058613
Come Barrois said the young girl take some of this lemonade I see you are coveting a good draught of it	86.73164897726248
The fact is mademoiselle said Barrois I am dying with thirst and since you are so kind as to offer it me I can not say I should at all object to drinking your health in a glass of it	57.68792855884588
Take some then and come back immediately	124.72134279839337
Barrois took away the waiter and hardly was he outside the door which in his haste he forgot to shut than they saw him throw back his head and empty to the very dregs the glass which Valentine had filled	126.59220145009972
Valentine and Morrel were exchanging their adieux in the presence of Noirtier when a ring was heard at the doorbell	94.5883140094167
It was the signal of a visit	93.34874094507275
It is past noon said she and today is Saturday I dare say it is the doctor grandpapa	114.51630439301877
Noirtier looked his conviction that she was right in her supposition	109.28737628577613
He will come in here and M	26.744457158714912
Morrel had better godo you not think so grandpapa	75.68483743038675
I am coming mademoiselle replied he	48.870315630272664
Barrois will open the door for you said Valentine addressing Morrel	35.593126206246296
And now remember one thing Monsieur Officer that my grandfather commands you not to take any rash or illadvised step which would be likely to compromise our happiness	239.8316481905372
I promised him to wait replied Morrel and I will wait	26.253964612281845
Doctor dAvrigny said Barrois staggering as if he would fall	27.48571893325743
What is the matter Barrois said Valentine	14.92018745138623
The old man did not answer but looked at his master with wild staring eyes while with his cramped hand he grasped a piece of furniture to enable him to stand upright	108.90155786947942
He is going to fall cried Morrel	63.37130931205005
The rigors which had attacked Barrois gradually increased the features of the face became quite altered and the convulsive movement of the muscles appeared to indicate the approach of a most serious nervous disorder	122.77505964945844
Noirtier seeing Barrois in this pitiable condition showed by his looks all the various emotions of sorrow and sympathy which can animate the heart of man	241.44420122285234
Barrois made some steps towards his master	28.749079302063777
Ah sir said he tell me what is the matter with me	13.730734150833257
I am sufferingI can not see	51.47679455509158
A thousand fiery darts are piercing my brain	192.02106428660792
Ah do nt touch me pray do nt	69.08994868656093
By this time his haggard eyes had the appearance of being ready to start from their sockets his head fell back and the lower extremities of the body began to stiffen	81.18291045179035
Valentine uttered a cry of horror Morrel took her in his arms as if to defend her from some unknown danger	35.38740236912663
dAvrigny cried she in a stifled voice	46.30981155692152
Barrois turned round and with a great effort stumbled a few steps then fell at the feet of Noirtier and resting his hand on the knee of the invalid exclaimed	44.46143262013467
de Villefort attracted by the noise appeared on the threshold	37.307116992924236
Morrel relaxed his hold of Valentine and retreating to a distant corner of the room remained half hidden behind a curtain	89.71728926296355
Pale as if he had been gazing on a serpent he fixed his terrified eye on the agonized sufferer	178.29034280803018
Noirtier burning with impatience and terror was in despair at his utter inability to help his old domestic whom he regarded more in the light of a friend than a servant	121.25601324175058
One might by the fearful swelling of the veins of his forehead and the contraction of the muscles round the eye trace the terrible conflict which was going on between the living energetic mind and the inanimate and helpless body	152.0907029981367
Barrois his features convulsed his eyes suffused with blood and his head thrown back was lying at full length beating the floor with his hands while his legs had become so stiff that they looked as if they would break rather than bend	90.92672882388577
A slight appearance of foam was visible around the mouth and he breathed painfully and with extreme difficulty	128.02989129522888
Villefort seemed stupefied with astonishment and remained gazing intently on the scene before him without uttering a word	56.189332012904835
After a moment of dumb contemplation during which his face became pale and his hair seemed to stand on end he sprang towards the door crying out	34.43255342805064
Doctor doctor come instantly pray come	1134.324383359245
Madame madame cried Valentine calling her stepmother and running upstairs to meet her come quick quickand bring your bottle of smellingsalts with you	316.938690937046
What is the matter said Madame de Villefort in a harsh and constrained tone	67.39153934523563
But where is the doctor exclaimed Villefort where is he	60.559181976197
Madame de Villefort now deliberately descended the staircase	211.37567065970006
In one hand she held her handkerchief with which she appeared to be wiping her face and in the other a bottle of English smellingsalts	68.8489753566639
Her first look on entering the room was at Noirtier whose face independent of the emotion which such a scene could not fail of producing proclaimed him to be in possession of his usual health her second glance was at the dying man	106.01486361920043
She turned pale and her eye passed quickly from the servant and rested on the master	60.38349331422102
In the name of heaven madame said Villefort where is the doctor He was with you just now	62.46114963943174
You see this is a fit of apoplexy and he might be saved if he could but be bled	120.71399498388496
Has he eaten anything lately asked Madame de Villefort eluding her husbands question	144.4797208432477
Madame replied Valentine he has not even breakfasted	705.8201811638459
He has been running very fast on an errand with which my grandfather charged him and when he returned took nothing but a glass of lemonade	125.98076216727925
Ah said Madame de Villefort why did he not take wine Lemonade was a very bad thing for him	122.59445703984485
Grandpapas bottle of lemonade was standing just by his side poor Barrois was very thirsty and was thankful to drink anything he could find	180.58851478424907
Noirtier looked at her with a glance of the most profound scrutiny	52.96343397126583
He has such a short neck said she	472.0852045490016
Madame said Villefort I ask where is M	177.55246361367423
dAvrigny In Gods name answer me	74.39130349345889
He is with Edward who is not quite well replied Madame de Villefort no longer being able to avoid answering	56.28389990166846
Villefort rushed upstairs to fetch him	4.912884520456223
Take this said Madame de Villefort giving her smellingbottle to Valentine	53.87726537957825
They will no doubt bleed him therefore I will retire for I can not endure the sight of blood and she followed her husband upstairs	72.67001242473337
Morrel now emerged from his hidingplace where he had remained quite unperceived so great had been the general confusion	184.9325469514233
Go away as quick as you can Maximilian said Valentine and stay till I send for you	43.902239621291606
Morrel looked towards Noirtier for permission to retire	134.05435666169225
The old man who had preserved all his usual coolness made a sign to him to do so	25.777262875999213
The young man pressed Valentines hand to his lips and then left the house by a back staircase	26.25550786866687
At the same moment that he quitted the room Villefort and the doctor entered by an opposite door	64.7807781697817
Barrois was now showing signs of returning consciousness	233.66168301984584
The crisis seemed past a low moaning was heard and he raised himself on one knee	59.419795787014536
DAvrigny and Villefort laid him on a couch	28.03309079458627
What do you prescribe doctor demanded Villefort	423.3766122808104
Give me some water and ether	40450.98446725912
You have some in the house have you not	85.07189850441962
Send for some oil of turpentine and tartar emetic	1677.0686891860332
Must I go too asked Valentine timidly	465.33703324607905
Yes mademoiselle you especially replied the doctor abruptly	184.12769986630283
dAvrigny with astonishment kissed her grandfather on the forehead and left the room	21.233198492377795
The doctor closed the door after her with a gloomy air	34.71997812579501
Look look doctor said Villefort he is quite coming round again I really do not think after all it is anything of consequence	105.75192277272822
dAvrigny answered by a melancholy smile	6.972913698605975
How do you feel Barrois asked he	6.55624989708884
Will you drink some of this ether and water	401.08783407012913
I will try but do nt touch me	88.74176965532314
Because I feel that if you were only to touch me with the tip of your finger the fit would return	54.59887951045005
Barrois took the glass and raising it to his purple lips took about half of the liquid offered him	69.22610497538696
Where do you suffer asked the doctor	8.983069032999547
I feel cramps over my whole body	160.9191939451081
Do you find any dazzling sensation before the eyes	130.3831208205985
When did you first feel that	32.12471628050208
Yes like a clap of thunder	98.60149143741253
Did you feel nothing of it yesterday or the day before	54.427780259761526
I have eaten nothing I only drank a glass of my masters lemonadethats all	231.92056028866887
And Barrois turned towards Noirtier who immovably fixed in his armchair was contemplating this terrible scene without allowing a word or a movement to escape him	160.58457044276813
Where is this lemonade asked the doctor eagerly	57.97746620942638
Shall I go and fetch it doctor inquired Villefort	253.4111172467034
No stay here and try to make Barrois drink the rest of this glass of ether and water	70.45525528194158
I will go myself and fetch the lemonade	504.01796090077704
DAvrigny bounded towards the door flew down the back staircase and almost knocked down Madame de Villefort in his haste who was herself going down to the kitchen	71.62473558038856
She cried out but dAvrigny paid no attention to her possessed with but one idea he cleared the last four steps with a bound and rushed into the kitchen where he saw the decanter about three parts empty still standing on the waiter where it had been left	96.79444236181219
He darted upon it as an eagle would seize upon its prey	201.70639943167012
Panting with loss of breath he returned to the room he had just left	15.638782484055659
Madame de Villefort was slowly ascending the steps which led to her room	23.720682683781423
Is this the decanter you spoke of asked dAvrigny	251.74108191353824
Is this the same lemonade of which you partook	132.40727856437897
The doctor poured some drops of the lemonade into the palm of his hand put his lips to it and after having rinsed his mouth as a man does when he is tasting wine he spat the liquor into the fireplace	101.76609447196392
It is no doubt the same said he	42.29352463897198
Did you drink some too M	398.0186377488186
And did you also discover a bitter taste	476.9017032638208
Oh doctor cried Barrois the fit is coming on again	237.2079103747212
The doctor flew to his patient	9627.882495380787
That emetic Villefortsee if it is coming	48.939983498703725
Villefort sprang into the passage exclaiming The emetic the emeticis it come yet No one answered	939.3726756712786
The most profound terror reigned throughout the house	195.85765308234025
If I had anything by means of which I could inflate the lungs said dAvrigny looking around him perhaps I might prevent suffocation	172.5689277700637
But there is nothing which would donothing	5465.914718257828
Oh sir cried Barrois are you going to let me die without help Oh I am dying Oh save me	48.486576992828255
A pen a pen said the doctor	8.819982046905915
There was one lying on the table he endeavored to introduce it into the mouth of the patient who in the midst of his convulsions was making vain attempts to vomit but the jaws were so clenched that the pen could not pass them	53.72324687679465
This second attack was much more violent than the first and he had slipped from the couch to the ground where he was writhing in agony	47.462607307541546
The doctor left him in this paroxysm knowing that he could do nothing to alleviate it and going up to Noirtier said abruptly	120.87501142456438
Have you any weight on the chest or does your stomach feel light and comfortableeh	366.5225742010548
Then you feel pretty much as you generally do after you have had the dose which I am accustomed to give you every Sunday	82.95896293725934
Was it you who asked him to drink some of it	52.988482263501155
It was your granddaughter then was it not	57.10094499290354
A groan from Barrois accompanied by a yawn which seemed to crack the very jawbones attracted the attention of M	81.76808411257409
Noirtier and returned to the sick man	136.59419906273885
Barrois said the doctor can you speak Barrois muttered a few unintelligible words	198.24027833699827
Try and make an effort to do so my good man	37.94414210764464
Did you bring it to your master directly it was made	114.29586266710648
You left it somewhere then in the meantime	56.202067936515384
Yes I left it in the pantry because I was called away	242.89409103907536
Who brought it into this room then	9.396593840332436
DAvrigny struck his forehead with his hand	6.684716589259857
Doctor doctor cried Barrois who felt another fit coming	438.43655611424145
Will they never bring that emetic asked the doctor	203.35274000747023
Here is a glass with one already prepared said Villefort entering the room	74.87676374033502
The chemist who came here with me	23.92855584063917
Drink it said the doctor to Barrois	211.35987213953965
Impossible doctor it is too late my throat is closing up	123.7772785185269
I am choking Oh my heart Ah my headOh what agonyShall I suffer like this long	508.4044941779198
No no friend replied the doctor you will soon cease to suffer	56.00499006568275
Ah I understand you said the unhappy man	19.532583223959612
My God have mercy upon me and uttering a fearful cry Barrois fell back as if he had been struck by lightning	36.2574192748593
DAvrigny put his hand to his heart and placed a glass before his lips	26.504737687315977
Go to the kitchen and get me some syrup of violets	251.667085936872
Noirtier said dAvrigny I am going to take my patient into the next room to bleed him this sort of attack is very frightful to witness	79.25532634247314
And taking Barrois under the arms he dragged him into an adjoining room but almost immediately he returned to fetch the lemonade	84.26751307384819
You want Valentine do you not I will tell them to send her to you	27.124676236006867
Villefort returned and dAvrigny met him in the passage	12.65032329397262
Well how is he now asked he	19.981222114314985
Come in here said dAvrigny and he took him into the chamber where the sick man lay	52.801481095690626
Is he still in a fit said the procureur	61.12811100510761
Villefort drew back a few steps and clasping his hands exclaimed with real amazement and sympathy Deadand so soon too	241.19682427632804
Yes it is very soon said the doctor looking at the corpse before him but that ought not to astonish you Monsieur and Madame de SaintMran died as soon	69.52246843616176
People die very suddenly in your house M	44.078443208608874
What cried the magistrate with an accent of horror and consternation are you still harping on that terrible idea	132.70130355074508
Still sir and I shall always do so replied dAvrigny for it has never for one instant ceased to retain possession of my mind and that you may be quite sure I am not mistaken this time listen well to what I am going to say M	50.990281958707584
There is a poison which destroys life almost without leaving any perceptible traces	1240.6913619581983
I know it well I have studied it in all its forms and in the effects which it produces	76.91141891535163
I recognized the presence of this poison in the case of poor Barrois as well as in that of Madame de SaintMran	36.523404360846996
There is a way of detecting its presence	1654.6316910777507
It restores the blue color of litmuspaper reddened by an acid and it turns syrup of violets green	493.85134579377547
We have no litmuspaper but see here they come with the syrup of violets	112.80388882227435
The doctor was right steps were heard in the passage	13.823958699569587
dAvrigny opened the door and took from the hands of the chambermaid a cup which contained two or three spoonfuls of the syrup he then carefully closed the door	56.11266161188734
Look said he to the procureur whose heart beat so loudly that it might almost be heard here is in this cup some syrup of violets and this decanter contains the remainder of the lemonade of which M	114.29690065888848
If the lemonade be pure and inoffensive the syrup will retain its color if on the contrary the lemonade be drugged with poison the syrup will become green	251.68611080287917
The doctor then slowly poured some drops of the lemonade from the decanter into the cup and in an instant a light cloudy sediment began to form at the bottom of the cup this sediment first took a blue shade then from the color of sapphire it passed to that of opal and from opal to emerald	152.6720817505897
Arrived at this last hue it changed no more	87.90020442281204
The result of the experiment left no doubt whatever on the mind	111.47833400531208
The unfortunate Barrois has been poisoned said dAvrigny and I will maintain this assertion before God and man	198.40156607168328
Villefort said nothing but he clasped his hands opened his haggard eyes and overcome with his emotion sank into a chair	47.06862805220222
dAvrigny soon restored the magistrate to consciousness who had looked like a second corpse in that chamber of death	101.7374662229546
Oh death is in my house cried Villefort	20.090913829794346
Say rather crime replied the doctor	16.95803702685677
dAvrigny cried Villefort I can not tell you all I feel at this momentterror grief madness	115.28565082682212
dAvrigny with an imposing calmness but I think it is now time to act	34.89555423555515
I think it is time to stop this torrent of mortality	543.0853248377288
I can no longer bear to be in possession of these secrets without the hope of seeing the victims and society generally revenged	146.49906392740067
Villefort cast a gloomy look around him	2.2133335765516557
In my house murmured he in my house	55.15163421589974
dAvrigny show yourself a man as an interpreter of the law do honor to your profession by sacrificing your selfish interests to it	94.27309457248704
Do you talk of a sacrifice	2492.1828910680574
I suspect no one death raps at your doorit entersit goes not blindfolded but circumspectly from room to room	2273.3590708444394
Well I follow its course I track its passage I adopt the wisdom of the ancients and feel my way for my friendship for your family and my respect for you are as a twofold bandage over my eyes well	148.33090837017696
Oh speak speak doctor I shall have courage	56.8175754631399
Well sir you have in your establishment or in your family perhaps one of the frightful monstrosities of which each century produces only one	209.03692290932497
Locusta and Agrippina living at the same time were an exception and proved the determination of Providence to effect the entire ruin of the Roman empire sullied by so many crimes	110.89817284465055
Brunhilda and Fredegund were the results of the painful struggle of civilization in its infancy when man was learning to control mind were it even by an emissary from the realms of darkness	212.29651275350318
All these women had been or were beautiful	713.0163988664987
The same flower of innocence had flourished or was still flourishing on their brow that is seen on the brow of the culprit in your house	116.83703546207171
Villefort shrieked clasped his hands and looked at the doctor with a supplicating air	22.022035055079893
But the latter went on without pity	289.71857667379237
Seek whom the crime will profit says an axiom of jurisprudence	1156.9327184155993
Doctor cried Villefort alas doctor how often has mans justice been deceived by those fatal words	225.97051381195936
I know not why but I feel that this crime	35.4444852646922
You acknowledge then the existence of the crime	14.153185547678618
Yes I see too plainly that it does exist	145.68458120822837
But it seems that it is intended to affect me personally	82.78317475521469
I fear an attack myself after all these disasters	287.1985800294956
Oh man murmured dAvrigny the most selfish of all animals the most personal of all creatures who believes the earth turns the sun shines and death strikes for him alonean ant cursing God from the top of a blade of grass And have those who have lost their lives lost nothingM	291.65706046161125
de SaintMran Madame de SaintMran M	217.0849172924651
Yes think you it was the poor servants life was coveted No no like Shakespeares Polonius he died for another	343.5114991126331
It was Noirtier the lemonade was intended forit is Noirtier logically speaking who drank it	450.7332825994244
The other drank it only by accident and although Barrois is dead it was Noirtier whose death was wished for	112.32561496972744
But why did it not kill my father	26.594316948682792
I told you one evening in the garden after Madame de SaintMrans deathbecause his system is accustomed to that very poison and the dose was trifling to him which would be fatal to another because no one knows not even the assassin that for the last twelve months I have given M	85.32550743497832
Noirtier brucine for his paralytic affection while the assassin is not ignorant for he has proved that brucine is a violent poison	116.88446340005893
Oh have pityhave pity murmured Villefort wringing his hands	29.663714679215694
Follow the culprits steps he first kills M	3475.609139524631
I would swear to it what I heard of his symptoms agrees too well with what I have seen in the other cases	143.15334159421712
Villefort ceased to contend he only groaned	1912.3150419292813
de SaintMran repeated the doctor then Madame de SaintMrana double fortune to inherit	315.2270983227675
Villefort wiped the perspiration from his forehead	4.639695118433051
Alas stammered Villefort I do not lose a single word	20.507159323892754
dAvrigny in the same pitiless toneM	109717.09174383433
Noirtier had once made a will against youagainst your familyin favor of the poor in fact M	552.1660922898674
Noirtier is spared because nothing is expected from him	103.53985935595445
But he has no sooner destroyed his first will and made a second than for fear he should make a third he is struck down	134.23901484007393
The will was made the day before yesterday I believe you see there has been no time lost	47.589019435036704
No mercy sir The physician has a sacred mission on earth and to fulfil it he begins at the source of life and goes down to the mysterious darkness of the tomb	85.75238074547097
When crime has been committed and God doubtless in anger turns away his face it is for the physician to bring the culprit to justice	156.14065075764861
Have mercy on my child sir murmured Villefort	76.03241409576025
You see it is yourself who have first named heryou her father	233.35763932700934
Have pity on Valentine Listen it is impossible	12.844727486135993
I would as willingly accuse myself Valentine whose heart is pure as a diamond or a lily	105.84771930379864
No pity procureur the crime is fragrant	425.70762313201595
Mademoiselle herself packed all the medicines which were sent to M	123.29700340727003
Mademoiselle de Villefort prepared all the cooling draughts which Madame de SaintMran took and Madame de SaintMran is dead	117.02573406433835
Mademoiselle de Villefort took from the hands of Barrois who was sent out the lemonade which M	40.09351253723962
Noirtier had every morning and he has escaped by a miracle	60.053172655501555
Mademoiselle de Villefort is the culpritshe is the poisoner To you as the kings attorney I denounce Mademoiselle de Villefort do your duty	125.29467130503085
Doctor I resist no longerI can no longer defend myselfI believe you but for pitys sake spare my life my honor	150.03313339913862
de Villefort replied the doctor with increased vehemence there are occasions when I dispense with all foolish human circumspection	460.218362407285
If your daughter had committed only one crime and I saw her meditating another I would say Warn her punish her let her pass the remainder of her life in a convent weeping and praying	186.2577338896861
If she had committed two crimes I would say Here M	162.77336387010422
de Villefort is a poison that the prisoner is not acquainted withone that has no known antidote quick as thought rapid as lightning mortal as the thunderbolt give her that poison recommending her soul to God and save your honor and your life for it is yours she aims at and I can picture her approaching your pillow with her hypocritical smiles and her sweet exhortations	293.1551994216521
de Villefort if you do not strike first This is what I would say had she only killed two persons but she has seen three deathshas contemplated three murdered personshas knelt by three corpses To the scaffold with the poisonerto the scaffold Do you talk of your honor Do what I tell you and immortality awaits you	260.1851366809608
Listen said he I have not the strength of mind you have or rather that which you would not have if instead of my daughter Valentine your daughter Madeleine were concerned	108.16865977245236
Doctor every son of woman is born to suffer and to die I am content to suffer and to await death	110.64692839552539
dAvrigny it may come slowly you will see it approach after having struck your father your wife perhaps your son	99.20187724148572
Villefort suffocating pressed the doctors arm	41.84257556341888
Listen cried he pity mehelp me No my daughter is not guilty	56.62284998556361
If you drag us both before a tribunal I will still say No my daughter is not guiltythere is no crime in my house	107.85150763317017
I will not acknowledge a crime in my house for when crime enters a dwelling it is like deathit does not come alone	190.42181615962312
What does it signify to you if I am murdered Are you my friend Are you a man Have you a heart No you are a physician Well I tell you I will not drag my daughter before a tribunal and give her up to the executioner The bare idea would kill mewould drive me like a madman to dig my heart out with my fingernails And if you were mistaken doctorif it were not my daughterif I should come one day pale as a spectre and say to you Assassin you have killed my childholdif that should happen although I am a Christian M	107.47380066869628
Well said the doctor after a moments silence I will wait	27.262114308245966
Villefort looked at him as if he had doubted his words	44.29173663237262
dAvrigny with a slow and solemn tone if anyone falls ill in your house if you feel yourself attacked do not send for me for I will come no more	74.74204677935386
I will consent to share this dreadful secret with you but I will not allow shame and remorse to grow and increase in my conscience as crime and misery will in your house	114.45814388265241
Yes for I can follow you no farther and I only stop at the foot of the scaffold	41.083709444547424
Some further discovery will be made which will bring this dreadful tragedy to a close	192.6707366308254
All the horrors that disturb my thoughts make your house odious and fatal	432.8244674847377
One wordone single word more doctor You go leaving me in all the horror of my situation after increasing it by what you have revealed to me	87.65583839929212
But what will be reported of the sudden death of the poor old servant	38.12375896339819
The doctor went out first followed by M	44.97401288689873
The terrified servants were on the stairs and in the passage where the doctor would pass	22.98614368418023
Sir said dAvrigny to Villefort so loud that all might hear poor Barrois has led too sedentary a life of late accustomed formerly to ride on horseback or in the carriage to the four corners of Europe the monotonous walk around that armchair has killed himhis blood has thickened	316.44608122354316
He was stout had a short thick neck he was attacked with apoplexy and I was called in too late	140.89177895187922
By the way added he in a low tone take care to throw away that cup of syrup of violets in the ashes	85.92738810864324
The doctor without shaking hands with Villefort without adding a word to what he had said went out amid the tears and lamentations of the whole household	63.67501691179756
The same evening all Villeforts servants who had assembled in the kitchen and had a long consultation came to tell Madame de Villefort that they wished to leave	54.891340455379634
No entreaty no proposition of increased wages could induce them to remain to every argument they replied We must go for death is in this house	208.66490435336001
They all left in spite of prayers and entreaties testifying their regret at leaving so good a master and mistress and especially Mademoiselle Valentine so good so kind and so gentle	199.87890455191624
Villefort looked at Valentine as they said this	61.59901258598635
She was in tears and strange as it was in spite of the emotions he felt at the sight of these tears he looked also at Madame de Villefort and it appeared to him as if a slight gloomy smile had passed over her thin lips like a meteor seen passing inauspiciously between two clouds in a stormy sky	59.10359085198334
The Room of the Retired Baker	7323.067945965932
The evening of the day on which the Count of Morcerf had left Danglars house with feelings of shame and anger at the rejection of the projected alliance M	81.16795386936914
Andrea Cavalcanti with curled hair moustaches in perfect order and white gloves which fitted admirably had entered the courtyard of the bankers house in Rue de la Chausse dAntin	64.74142907661704
He had not been more than ten minutes in the drawingroom before he drew Danglars aside into the recess of a bowwindow and after an ingenious preamble related to him all his anxieties and cares since his noble fathers departure	134.2035924109196
He acknowledged the extreme kindness which had been shown him by the bankers family in which he had been received as a son and where besides his warmest affections had found an object on which to centre in Mademoiselle Danglars	86.79418570281604
Danglars listened with the most profound attention he had expected this declaration for the last two or three days and when at last it came his eyes glistened as much as they had lowered on listening to Morcerf	61.92584678821325
He would not however yield immediately to the young mans request but made a few conscientious objections	169.79586881252712
Are you not rather young M	86.22701833197037
I think not sir replied M	232.81795158259214
Cavalcanti in Italy the nobility generally marry young	1017.1372148072877
Life is so uncertain that we ought to secure happiness while it is within our reach	105.9206980845823
Well sir said Danglars in case your proposals which do me honor are accepted by my wife and daughter by whom shall the preliminary arrangements be settled So important a negotiation should I think be conducted by the respective fathers of the young people	177.86217566792013
Sir my father is a man of great foresight and prudence	210.6484938058486
Thinking that I might wish to settle in France he left me at his departure together with the papers establishing my identity a letter promising if he approved of my choice 150000 livres per annum from the day I was married	104.21636637113554
So far as I can judge I suppose this to be a quarter of my fathers revenue	73.93007389981801
I said Danglars have always intended giving my daughter 500000 francs as her dowry she is besides my sole heiress	327.6618720458125
All would then be easily arranged if the baroness and her daughter are willing	129.6744849271271
We should command an annuity of 175000 livres	59.514946137579884
Supposing also I should persuade the marquis to give me my capital which is not likely but still is possible we would place these two or three millions in your hands whose talent might make it realize ten per cent	92.47703662573998
I never give more than four per cent and generally only three and a half but to my soninlaw I would give five and we would share the profits	149.90053932161942
Very good fatherinlaw said Cavalcanti yielding to his lowborn nature which would escape sometimes through the aristocratic gloss with which he sought to conceal it	105.14269448088098
Correcting himself immediately he said Excuse me sir hope alone makes me almost madwhat will not reality do	1032.0357612761827
But said Danglars who on his part did not perceive how soon the conversation which was at first disinterested was turning to a business transaction there is doubtless a part of your fortune your father could not refuse you	100.11769081235205
That you inherit from your mother	312.77239986203386
Truly from my mother Leonora Corsinari	12091.708278074146
How much may it amount to	14.939515826982745
Indeed sir said Andrea I assure you I have never given the subject a thought but I suppose it must have been at least two millions	45.69969335640729
Danglars felt as much overcome with joy as the miser who finds a lost treasure or as the shipwrecked mariner who feels himself on solid ground instead of in the abyss which he expected would swallow him up	179.955877939865
Well sir said Andrea bowing to the banker respectfully may I hope	86.79934441176245
You may not only hope said Danglars but consider it a settled thing if no obstacle arises on your part	157.30065684047412
I am indeed rejoiced said Andrea	31.919816812715112
But said Danglars thoughtfully how is it that your patron M	62.24289348529472
de Monte Cristo did not make his proposal for you	88.17017812054789
I have just left the count sir said he he is doubtless a delightful man but inconceivably peculiar in his ideas	142.54633347486364
He even told me he had not the slightest doubt that my father would give me the capital instead of the interest of my property	49.03828429785948
He has promised to use his influence to obtain it for me but he also declared that he never had taken on himself the responsibility of making proposals for another and he never would	93.95970984817824
I must however do him the justice to add that he assured me if ever he had regretted the repugnance he felt to such a step it was on this occasion because he thought the projected union would be a happy and suitable one	128.13992610809035
Besides if he will do nothing officially he will answer any questions you propose to him	187.55506850994774
And now continued he with one of his most charming smiles having finished talking to the fatherinlaw I must address myself to the banker	81.23303573728694
And what may you have to say to him said Danglars laughing in his turn	19.17074544833594
That the day after tomorrow I shall have to draw upon you for about four thousand francs but the count expecting my bachelors revenue could not suffice for the coming months outlay has offered me a draft for twenty thousand francs	91.01685172901168
It bears his signature as you see which is allsufficient	280.0156368605007
Bring me a million such as that said Danglars I shall be well pleased putting the draft in his pocket	66.69659957372832
Fix your own hour for tomorrow and my cashier shall call on you with a check for eighty thousand francs	69.778348709312
At ten oclock then if you please I should like it early as I am going into the country tomorrow	55.01178714000517
Very well at ten oclock you are still at the Htel des Princes	14.73784379631298
The following morning with the bankers usual punctuality the eighty thousand francs were placed in the young mans hands as he was on the point of starting after having left two hundred francs for Caderousse	49.07832569285097
He went out chiefly to avoid this dangerous enemy and returned as late as possible in the evening	93.0863782314438
But scarcely had he stepped out of his carriage when the porter met him with a parcel in his hand	31.21061049720653
Sir said he that man has been here	24.21870733594249
What man said Andrea carelessly apparently forgetting him whom he but too well recollected	447.6163956848653
Him to whom your excellency pays that little annuity	2528.1599883495637
Oh said Andrea my fathers old servant	181.5716138716185
Well you gave him the two hundred francs I had left for him	30.33122686207229
Andrea had expressed a wish to be thus addressed	55.04163342371625
But continued the porter he would not take them	26.852412887489074
Andrea turned pale but as it was dark his pallor was not perceptible	86.10009860730067
What he would not take them said he with slight emotion	66.34486065181599
No he wished to speak to your excellency I told him you were gone out and after some dispute he believed me and gave me this letter which he had brought with him already sealed	68.93440234908174
Give it me said Andrea and he read by the light of his carriagelamp	85.08944796686295
You know where I live I expect you tomorrow morning at nine oclock	45.03228424445165
Andrea examined it carefully to ascertain if the letter had been opened or if any indiscreet eyes had seen its contents but it was so carefully folded that no one could have read it and the seal was perfect	86.21854849890137
Poor man he is a worthy creature	310.7929456058652
He left the porter to ponder on these words not knowing which most to admire the master or the servant	182.50091761217627
Take out the horses quickly and come up to me said Andrea to his groom	49.76214966737031
In two seconds the young man had reached his room and burnt Caderousses letter	114.55699847439084
The servant entered just as he had finished	38.47781315407234
You are about my height Pierre said he	117.37142362251826
I have that honor your excellency	130.290953053206
You had a new livery yesterday	487.00639020525637
I have an engagement with a pretty little girl for this evening and do not wish to be known lend me your livery till tomorrow	68.46968781401081
I may sleep perhaps at an inn	104.06795387006827
Five minutes after Andrea left the hotel completely disguised took a cabriolet and ordered the driver to take him to the Cheval Rouge at Picpus	174.40609618031277
The next morning he left that inn as he had left the Htel des Princes without being noticed walked down the Faubourg SaintAntoine along the boulevard to Rue Mnilmontant and stopping at the door of the third house on the left looked for someone of whom to make inquiry in the porters absence	110.71311501793761
For whom are you looking my fine fellow asked the fruiteress on the opposite side	80.39933087121429
Monsieur Pailletin if you please my good woman replied Andrea	96.04013419114897
A retired baker asked the fruiteress	70685.96190629256
He lives at the end of the yard on the left on the third story	31.663433809098496
Andrea went as she directed him and on the third floor he found a hares paw which by the hasty ringing of the bell it was evident he pulled with considerable illtemper	72.6835212900258
A moment after Caderousses face appeared at the grating in the door	43.5104516464889
Ah you are punctual said he as he drew back the door	26.020454709876887
Confound you and your punctuality said Andrea throwing himself into a chair in a manner which implied that he would rather have flung it at the head of his host	41.422588557933295
Come come my little fellow do nt be angry	33.02731437111286
See I have thought about youlook at the good breakfast we are going to have nothing but what you are fond of	77.86420634882836
Andrea indeed inhaled the scent of something cooking which was not unwelcome to him hungry as he was it was that mixture of fat and garlic peculiar to Provenal kitchens of an inferior order added to that of dried fish and above all the pungent smell of musk and cloves	233.06004915927622
These odors escaped from two deep dishes which were covered and placed on a stove and from a copper pan placed in an old iron pot	141.82506350695738
In an adjoining room Andrea saw also a tolerably clean table prepared for two two bottles of wine sealed the one with green the other with yellow a supply of brandy in a decanter and a measure of fruit in a cabbageleaf cleverly arranged on an earthenware plate	214.83642173152978
What do you think of it my little fellow said Caderousse	105.37800269150726
Ay that smells good You know I used to be a good cook do you recollect how you used to lick your fingers You were among the first who tasted any of my dishes and I think you relished them tolerably	155.1295644504549
While speaking Caderousse went on peeling a fresh supply of onions	687.7497068006627
But said Andrea illtemperedly by my faith if it was only to breakfast with you that you disturbed me I wish the devil had taken you	81.02534278122636
My boy said Caderousse sententiously one can talk while eating	665.4362169780354
And then you ungrateful being you are not pleased to see an old friend I am weeping with joy	49.05427091733464
He was truly crying but it would have been difficult to say whether joy or the onions produced the greatest effect on the lachrymal glands of the old innkeeper of the PontduGard	118.67473782537085
Hold your tongue hypocrite said Andrea you love me	29.651245599277125
Yes I do or may the devil take me	136.81224342867978
I know it is a weakness said Caderousse but it overpowers me	227.57545156470434
And yet it has not prevented your sending for me to play me some trick	137.34545029990292
Come said Caderousse wiping his large knife on his apron if I did not like you do you think I should endure the wretched life you lead me Think for a moment	81.1513934746201
You have your servants clothes onyou therefore keep a servant I have none and am obliged to prepare my own meals	212.52354691984803
You abuse my cookery because you dine at the table dhte of the Htel des Princes or the Caf de Paris	37.238015261203344
Well I too could keep a servant I too could have a tilbury I too could dine where I like but why do I not Because I would not annoy my little Benedetto	154.6367461381624
Come just acknowledge that I could eh	2180.8878942767083
This address was accompanied by a look which was by no means difficult to understand	40.00949495544709
Well said Andrea admitting your love why do you want me to breakfast with you	31.637768227455744
That I may have the pleasure of seeing you my little fellow	30.559944139435256
What is the use of seeing me after we have made all our arrangements	70.49685090044743
Eh dear friend said Caderousse are wills ever made without codicils But you first came to breakfast did you not Well sit down and let us begin with these pilchards and this fresh butter which I have put on some vineleaves to please you wicked one	247.86406549217472
Ah yes you look at my room my four straw chairs my images three francs each	358.77759981868377
But what do you expect This is not the Htel des Princes	83.2647718548386
Come you are growing discontented you are no longer happy you who only wish to live like a retired baker	78.4587099975577
Well what have you to say you have seen your dream realized	186.24725781397981
I can still say it is a dream a retired baker my poor Benedetto is richhe has an annuity	312.74343046688404
Yes since I bring you your two hundred francs	21.585589190336155
It is humiliating said he thus to receive money given grudginglyan uncertain supply which may soon fail	841.6958427268
You see I am obliged to economize in case your prosperity should cease	514.2699182987261
Well my friend fortune is inconstant as the chaplain of the regiment said	243.42927194613077
I know your prosperity is great you rascal you are to marry the daughter of Danglars	98.73132038115673
Yes to be sure must I say Baron Danglars I might as well say Count Benedetto	138.08249965933987
He was an old friend of mine and if he had not so bad a memory he ought to invite me to your wedding seeing he came to mine	71.95343479848617
Yes yes to mine gad he was not so proud thenhe was an underclerk to the good M	183.85543145942893
I have dined many times with him and the Count of Morcerf so you see I have some high connections and were I to cultivate them a little we might meet in the same drawingrooms	126.83187489787188
Come your jealousy represents everything to you in the wrong light	89.16485676368302
That is all very fine Benedetto mio but I know what I am saying	51.782245499881256
Perhaps I may one day put on my best coat and presenting myself at the great gate introduce myself	193.39335460824216
Meanwhile let us sit down and eat	293.0877394782831
Caderousse set the example and attacked the breakfast with good appetite praising each dish he set before his visitor	548.2057593105432
The latter seemed to have resigned himself he drew the corks and partook largely of the fish with the garlic and fat	301.8912198378862
Ah mate said Caderousse you are getting on better terms with your old landlord	131.0716027824561
Faith yes replied Andrea whose hunger prevailed over every other feeling	597.8393488435615
So you like it you rogue	164777.289807832
So much that I wonder how a man who can cook thus can complain of hard living	253.78390792867197
Do you see said Caderousse all my happiness is marred by one thought	233.3924258462079
That I am dependent on another I who have always gained my own livelihood honestly	361.2249018018748
Do not let that disturb you I have enough for two	41.15228172691037
No truly you may believe me if you will at the end of every month I am tormented by remorse	29.03178082801723
So much so that yesterday I would not take the two hundred francs	25.905111582153353
Yes you wished to speak to me but was it indeed remorse tell me	90.9774623139153
True remorse and besides an idea had struck me	60.80240589121758
Andrea shuddered he always did so at Caderousses ideas	665.2737847247372
It is miserabledo you seealways to wait till the end of the month	13.047019579533892
Oh said Andrea philosophically determined to watch his companion narrowly does not life pass in waiting Do I for instance fare better Well I wait patiently do I not	245.20228003904347
Yes because instead of expecting two hundred wretched francs you expect five or six thousand perhaps ten perhaps even twelve for you take care not to let anyone know the utmost	129.36410343501697
Down there you always had little presents and Christmasboxes which you tried to hide from your poor friend Caderousse	320.3556369980283
Fortunately he is a cunning fellow that friend Caderousse	275.8764267550861
There you are beginning again to ramble to talk again and again of the past But what is the use of teasing me with going all over that again	132.92706312207682
Ah you are only oneandtwenty and can forget the past I am fifty and am obliged to recollect it	91.8822200498233
But let us return to business	29043.231962645066
I was going to say if I were in your place	31.58243322146897
I would ask for six months in advance under pretence of being able to purchase a farm then with my six months I would decamp	162.5394843235648
Well well said Andrea that is nt a bad idea	59.816141479202955
My dear friend said Caderousse eat of my bread and take my advice you will be none the worse off physically or morally	193.4648706912501
But said Andrea why do you not act on the advice you gave me Why do you not realize a six months a years advance even and retire to Brussels Instead of living the retired baker you might live as a bankrupt using his privileges that would be very good	165.58193443804754
But how the devil would you have me retire on twelve hundred francs	73.21394634319682
Ah Caderousse said Andrea how covetous you are Two months ago you were dying with hunger	111.88705624811513
The appetite grows by what it feeds on said Caderousse grinning and showing his teeth like a monkey laughing or a tiger growling	391.1583541074124
And added he biting off with his large white teeth an enormous mouthful of bread I have formed a plan	96.67883359767924
Caderousses plans alarmed Andrea still more than his ideas ideas were but the germ the plan was reality	183.5687429029435
Let me see your plan I dare say it is a pretty one	40.56921935923309
Why not Who formed the plan by which we left the establishment of M eh was it not I and it was no bad one I believe since here we are	73.63637071291038
I do not say replied Andrea that you never make a good one but let us see your plan	50.8694654675174
Well pursued Caderousse can you without expending one sou put me in the way of getting fifteen thousand francs No fifteen thousand are not enoughI can not again become an honest man with less than thirty thousand francs	118.07809373185002
No replied Andrea dryly no I can not	7.170491771713469
I do not think you understand me replied Caderousse calmly I said without your laying out a sou	171.78627221838505
Do you want me to commit a robbery to spoil all my good fortuneand yours with mineand both of us to be dragged down there again	317.10423776685946
It would make very little difference to me said Caderousse if I were retaken I am a poor creature to live alone and sometimes pine for my old comrades not like you heartless creature who would be glad never to see them again	121.50824621107024
Andrea did more than tremble this time he turned pale	35.12452796064297
Come Caderousse no nonsense said he	12.182427156629938
Do nt alarm yourself my little Benedetto but just point out to me some means of gaining those thirty thousand francs without your assistance and I will contrive it	100.27716731619209
Well Ill seeIll try to contrive some way said Andrea	164.9661905554808
Meanwhile you will raise my monthly allowance to five hundred francs my little fellow I have a fancy and mean to get a housekeeper	137.64168096723427
Well you shall have your five hundred francs said Andrea but it is very hard for me my poor Caderousseyou take advantage	47.9065421856693
Bah said Caderousse when you have access to countless stores	1098.7447080178324
One would have said Andrea anticipated his companions words so did his eye flash like lightning but it was but for a moment	113.76277043836633
True he replied and my protector is very kind	115.43468595855276
That dear protector said Caderousse and how much does he give you monthly	151.5224665203685
As many thousands as you give me hundreds Truly it is only bastards who are thus fortunate	379.0079517335379
Five thousand francs per month What the devil can you do with all that	37.79128379747519
Oh it is no trouble to spend that and I am like you I want capital	154.5571766930745
Well and I shall get it	13.961032364813317
Who will give it to youyour prince	13568.914881655604
You must wait for what asked Caderousse	212.09053291246062
Because he has made his will in my favor	168.60141350870055
Well I will tell you a secret	129.0741861228837
Ah pardieu mute as a carp	18190.43108895075
You think Do not fear pardieu we are alone	223.55999903261406
I think I have discovered my father	19.944276581139274
No for he has gone again the true one as you say	139.17701354002887
Well Caderousse it is Monte Cristo	1.043854714584222
Yes you understand that explains all	113.71475036030087
He can not acknowledge me openly it appears but he does it through M	251.73840187919828
Cavalcanti and gives him fifty thousand francs for it	7.390096889561649
Fifty thousand francs for being your father I would have done it for half that for twenty thousand for fifteen thousand why did you not think of me ungrateful man	55.87778885344775
Did I know anything about it when it was all done when I was down there	49.96129945198233
Ah truly And you say that by his will	209.38260807676835
He leaves me five hundred thousand livres	9.399766112341133
He showed it me but that is not allthere is a codicil as I said just now	82.3556923303746
And in that codicil he acknowledges me	3861.9286226711865
Oh the good father the brave father the very honest father said Caderousse twirling a plate in the air between his two hands	150.35386171554566
Now say if I conceal anything from you	51.79396989686504
No and your confidence makes you honorable in my opinion and your princely father is he rich very rich	122.7733580724414
Yes he is that he does not himself know the amount of his fortune	38.3327539706887
It is evident enough to me who am always at his house	54.31871111522749
The other day a bankers clerk brought him fifty thousand francs in a portfolio about the size of your plate yesterday his banker brought him a hundred thousand francs in gold	61.6706103749745
Caderousse was filled with wonder the young mans words sounded to him like metal and he thought he could hear the rushing of cascades of louis	142.9643199290653
And you go into that house cried he briskly	245.0244721373216
Caderousse was thoughtful for a moment	5.488332961456217
It was easy to perceive he was revolving some unfortunate idea in his mind	205.19793701669613
How I should like to see all that cried he how beautiful it must be	79.61578058510383
It is in fact magnificent said Andrea	49.85205123697929
And does he not live in the Champslyses	45.15951722274152
Yes a fine house standing alone between a courtyard and a gardenyou must know it	164.58878961684238
Possibly but it is not the exterior I care for it is the interior	118.55748672610858
What beautiful furniture there must be in it	31.840210006211166
Have you ever seen the Tuileries	7282.229113706814
It must be worth ones while to stoop Andrea when that good M	725.3861940987426
Monte Cristo lets fall his purse	355.19936860876646
It is not worthwhile to wait for that said Andrea money is as plentiful in that house as fruit in an orchard	190.37813143953488
But you should take me there one day with you	50.92649409360453
How can I On what plea	85009.73749250744
You are right but you have made my mouth water	172.70236449447393
I must absolutely see it I shall find a way	35.01271792407554
I will offer myself as floorpolisher	174186.78710285088
Well then I must be contented to imagine it	135.77525296329637
That is the best plan believe me	165.22583180687798
Try at least to give me an idea of what it is	17.60558757054464
Faith I should require pen ink and paper to make a plan	16.801654115198414
They are all here said Caderousse briskly	3736.0014547509695
He fetched from an old secretaire a sheet of white paper and pen and ink	34.39098598178698
Here said Caderousse draw me all that on the paper my boy	101.71133016545662
Andrea took the pen with an imperceptible smile and began	52.52253012535494
The house as I said is between the court and the garden in this way do you see Andrea drew the garden the court and the house	61.989650498106364
Not more than eight or ten feet	57.446233323398815
That is not prudent said Caderousse	57.71869317216453
In the court are orangetrees in pots turf and clumps of flowers	205.61211393040455
Are on either side of the gate which you see there	41.79535483667682
Let us see the ground floor said Caderousse	140.84331740048864
On the ground floor diningroom two drawingrooms billiardroom staircase in the hall and a little back staircase	164.15600054842426
Magnificent windows so beautiful so large that I believe a man of your size should pass through each frame	85.89894534666362
Why the devil have they any stairs with such windows	291.0380869558408
Yes but they are never used	609.9336039658876
That Count of Monte Cristo is an original who loves to look at the sky even at night	84.07458405208357
And where do the servants sleep	4300.959261624765
Oh they have a house to themselves	314.61204293547576
Picture to yourself a pretty coachhouse at the righthand side where the ladders are kept	198.41533106563273
Well over that coachhouse are the servants rooms with bells corresponding with the different apartments	293.3694708939621
Ah diable bells did you say	44.14927197014021
Oh nothing I only say they cost a load of money to hang and what is the use of them I should like to know	72.14675111344772
There used to be a dog let loose in the yard at night but it has been taken to the house at Auteuil to that you went to you know	65.47722364578034
I was saying to him only yesterday You are imprudent Monsieur Count for when you go to Auteuil and take your servants the house is left unprotected	263.9125650362862
Well said he what next Well next some day you will be robbed	125.32323979883232
He quietly said What do I care if I am	22.627710940492452
Andrea he has some secretaire with a spring	56.01381112626601
Yes which catches the thief in a trap and plays a tune	246.6734828273132
I was told there were such at the last exhibition	552.9539051549534
He has simply a mahogany secretaire in which the key is always kept	95.7702719094163
No his servants are all devoted to him	40.14776977435205
There ought to be some money in that secretaire	253.9874183826025
No one knows what there is	2.8238610924509127
Sketch me the plan of that floor as you have done of the ground floor my boy	152.44953354629567
On the first story do you see there is the anteroom and the drawingroom to the right of the drawingroom a library and a study to the left a bedroom and a dressingroom	53.34335248477564
The famous secretaire is in the dressingroom	108.60567223135808
Is there a window in the dressingroom	29.29926247118353
Andrea sketched two windows in the room which formed an angle on the plan and appeared as a small square added to the rectangle of the bedroom	70.43421084709544
Does he often go to Auteuil added he	210.16272505520223
Two or three times a week	342.3062338891469
Tomorrow for instance he is going to spend the day and night there	51.46224694088895
He has invited me to dine there	198.0914343975979
There s a life for you said Caderousse a town house and a country house	110.95186598570142
That is what it is to be rich	45.81434990288546
When you dine there do you sleep there	61.90795820612279
If I like I am at home there	44.93573327733501
Caderousse looked at the young man as if to get at the truth from the bottom of his heart	29.282503512473767
But Andrea drew a cigarcase from his pocket took a Havana quietly lit it and began smoking	133.5413206542204
When do you want your twelve hundred francs said he to Caderousse	37.07099863484586
Andrea took fiveandtwenty louis from his pocket	3.761310861287407
Yellow boys said Caderousse no I thank you	20.81738338065461
On the contrary I esteem them but will not have them	46.73281987198216
You can change them idiot gold is worth five sous	201.32076902220226
Exactly and he who changes them will follow friend Caderousse lay hands on him and demand what farmers pay him their rent in gold	298.105379313485
No nonsense my good fellow silver simply round coins with the head of some monarch or other on them	354.17090206349144
Anybody may possess a fivefranc piece	617.8564690836187
But do you suppose I carry five hundred francs about with me I should want a porter	129.82215805307396
Well leave them with your porter he is to be trusted	158.50319623853474
No tomorrow I shall not have time today	56.56152053419539
Well tomorrow I will leave them when I go to Auteuil	41.286979312754156
Because I shall secure my housekeeper on the strength of it	86.30555462699073
Now see here will that be all Eh And will you not torment me any more	135.05399015010943
Caderousse had become so gloomy that Andrea feared he should be obliged to notice the change	73.46325459879523
He redoubled his gayety and carelessness	24780.897398115714
How sprightly you are said Caderousse One would say you were already in possession of your property	81.22969899547516
No unfortunately but when I do obtain it	107.37470210322402
I shall remember old friends I can tell you that	12.46619867306397
Yes since you have such a good memory	43.34483931043437
What do you want It looks as if you were trying to fleece me	135.570311055136
I What an idea I who am going to give you another piece of good advice	38.608112737670545
To leave behind you the diamond you have on your finger	81.74552465170729
We shall both get into trouble	12363.412630014293
You will ruin both yourself and me by your folly	85.59360454463358
How You put on a livery you disguise yourself as a servant and yet keep a diamond on your finger worth four or five thousand francs	86.71149902798393
I know something of diamonds I have had some	44.133343733009944
You do well to boast of it said Andrea who without becoming angry as Caderousse feared at this new extortion quietly resigned the ring	260.6723833150687
Caderousse looked so closely at it that Andrea well knew that he was examining to see if all the edges were perfect	107.30668530219974
It is a false diamond said Caderousse	36.236176443887274
You are joking now replied Andrea	46.895640091066525
Do not be angry we can try it	95.55629109759441
Caderousse went to the window touched the glass with it and found it would cut	80.0983653264983
Confiteor said Caderousse putting the diamond on his little finger I was mistaken but those thieves of jewellers imitate so well that it is no longer worthwhile to rob a jewellers shopit is another branch of industry paralyzed	323.9373997981925
Have you finished said Andreado you want anything morewill you have my waistcoat or my hat Make free now you have begun	215.3010688146989
No you are after all a good companion I will not detain you and will try to cure myself of my ambition	87.88388209791906
But take care the same thing does not happen to you in selling the diamond you feared with the gold	97.51573407015076
I shall not sell itdo not fear	396.48430313196997
Not at least till the day after tomorrow thought the young man	20.66169294455025
Happy rogue said Caderousse you are going to find your servants your horses your carriage and your betrothed	52.74833928445979
Well I hope you will make a handsome weddingpresent the day you marry Mademoiselle Danglars	143.2739245801136
I have already told you it is a fancy you have taken in your head	51.63848640675828
Let it be a million said Caderousse you can never have so much as I wish you	22.96826523054624
Thank you said the young man	1.3220950409323227
Oh I wish it you with all my heart added Caderousse with his hoarse laugh	54.59350568896482
Stop let me show you the way	65.06019229527327
Because there is a little secret a precaution I thought it desirable to take one of Huret   Fichets locks revised and improved by Gaspard Caderousse I will manufacture you a similar one when you are a capitalist	369.164744544821
Thank you said Andrea I will let you know a week beforehand	109.45300158394876
Caderousse remained on the landing until he had not only seen Andrea go down the three stories but also cross the court	103.62237300771585
Then he returned hastily shut his door carefully and began to study like a clever architect the plan Andrea had left him	92.02431462284767
Dear Benedetto said he I think he will not be sorry to inherit his fortune and he who hastens the day when he can touch his five hundred thousand will not be his worst friend	71.80500854726338
The day following that on which the conversation we have related took place the Count of Monte Cristo set out for Auteuil accompanied by Ali and several attendants and also taking with him some horses whose qualities he was desirous of ascertaining	81.74663165373161
He was induced to undertake this journey of which the day before he had not even thought and which had not occurred to Andrea either by the arrival of Bertuccio from Normandy with intelligence respecting the house and sloop	108.47460224969213
The house was ready and the sloop which had arrived a week before lay at anchor in a small creek with her crew of six men who had observed all the requisite formalities and were ready again to put to sea	117.11724638089568
The count praised Bertuccios zeal and ordered him to prepare for a speedy departure as his stay in France would not be prolonged more than a month	93.2315826795206
Now said he I may require to go in one night from Paris to Trport let eight fresh horses be in readiness on the road which will enable me to go fifty leagues in ten hours	93.94131770769125
Your highness had already expressed that wish said Bertuccio and the horses are ready	146.45132839112736
I have bought them and stationed them myself at the most desirable posts that is in villages where no one generally stops	349.0080484148905
That s well said Monte Cristo I remain here a day or twoarrange accordingly	237.67978544224215
As Bertuccio was leaving the room to give the requisite orders Baptistin opened the door he held a letter on a silver waiter	47.92686370112572
What are you doing here asked the count seeing him covered with dust I did not send for you I think	25.647907205374903
Baptistin without answering approached the count and presented the letter	28.79866568786438
The count opened the letter and read	26.614231706744498
de Monte Cristo is apprised that this night a man will enter his house in the Champslyses with the intention of carrying off some papers supposed to be in the secretaire in the dressingroom	76.66507466844752
The counts wellknown courage will render unnecessary the aid of the police whose interference might seriously affect him who sends this advice	385.9608876137995
The count by any opening from the bedroom or by concealing himself in the dressingroom would be able to defend his property himself	75.287061506878
Many attendants or apparent precautions would prevent the villain from the attempt and M	128.49492887937612
de Monte Cristo would lose the opportunity of discovering an enemy whom chance has revealed to him who now sends this warning to the counta warning he might not be able to send another time if this first attempt should fail and another be made	135.26488313605932
The counts first idea was that this was an artificea gross deception to draw his attention from a minor danger in order to expose him to a greater	193.619117058378
He was on the point of sending the letter to the commissary of police notwithstanding the advice of his anonymous friend or perhaps because of that advice when suddenly the idea occurred to him that it might be some personal enemy whom he alone should recognize and over whom if such were the case he alone would gain any advantage as Fiesco17 had done over the Moor who would have killed him	96.05404724943263
We know the counts vigorous and daring mind denying anything to be impossible with that energy which marks the great man	215.57884310436873
From his past life from his resolution to shrink from nothing the count had acquired an inconceivable relish for the contests in which he had engaged sometimes against nature that is to say against God and sometimes against the world that is against the devil	131.38772209317258
They do not want my papers said Monte Cristo they want to kill me they are no robbers but assassins	104.87292918225411
I will not allow the prefect of police to interfere with my private affairs	115.87335398980626
I am rich enough forsooth to distribute his authority on this occasion	132.35899229731595
The count recalled Baptistin who had left the room after delivering the letter	45.00465097625798
Return to Paris said he assemble the servants who remain there	203.5833622342383
I want all my household at Auteuil	72.22078864249582
But will no one remain in the house my lord asked Baptistin	49.41373045794252
My lord will remember that the lodge is at a distance from the house	41.55209371380485
The house might be stripped without his hearing the least noise	215.42624400395835
Thieves might strip the houseit would annoy me less than to be disobeyed	106.36578153984114
You understand me said the count	2.6924439408506067
Bring your comrades here one and all but let everything remain as usual only close the shutters of the ground floor	118.28519706639496
And those of the first floor	181.10692809348
You know they are never closed	1433.2778010346917
The count signified his intention of dining alone and that no one but Ali should attend him	75.0564240092931
Having dined with his usual tranquillity and moderation the count making a signal to Ali to follow him went out by the sidegate and on reaching the Bois de Boulogne turned apparently without design towards Paris and at twilight found himself opposite his house in the Champslyses	114.71842675338314
All was dark one solitary feeble light was burning in the porters lodge about forty paces distant from the house as Baptistin had said	95.52909908261111
Monte Cristo leaned against a tree and with that scrutinizing glance which was so rarely deceived looked up and down the avenue examined the passersby and carefully looked down the neighboring streets to see that no one was concealed	114.48661664722546
Ten minutes passed thus and he was convinced that no one was watching him	34.011545247578944
He hastened to the sidedoor with Ali entered hurriedly and by the servants staircase of which he had the key gained his bedroom without opening or disarranging a single curtain without even the porter having the slightest suspicion that the house which he supposed empty contained its chief occupant	184.32494280048832
Arrived in his bedroom the count motioned to Ali to stop then he passed into the dressingroom which he examined	76.65702527229213
Everything appeared as usualthe precious secretaire in its place and the key in the secretaire	62.87806704347075
He double locked it took the key returned to the bedroom door removed the double staple of the bolt and went in	71.9317522719239
Meanwhile Ali had procured the arms the count requirednamely a short carbine and a pair of doublebarrelled pistols with which as sure an aim might be taken as with a singlebarrelled one	185.19365307959077
Thus armed the count held the lives of five men in his hands	30.46950743068838
The count and Ali ate in haste a crust of bread and drank a glass of Spanish wine then Monte Cristo slipped aside one of the movable panels which enabled him to see into the adjoining room	55.45675333597806
He had within his reach his pistols and carbine and Ali standing near him held one of the small Arabian hatchets whose form has not varied since the Crusades	194.57054111849598
Through one of the windows of the bedroom on a line with that in the dressingroom the count could see into the street	49.803586454450254
It was intensely dark still Ali thanks to his wild nature and the count thanks doubtless to his long confinement could distinguish in the darkness the slightest movement of the trees	153.18959849308652
The little light in the lodge had long been extinct	417.78656364164175
It might be expected that the attack if indeed an attack was projected would be made from the staircase of the ground floor and not from a window in Monte Cristos opinion the villains sought his life not his money	159.695121939001
It would be his bedroom they would attack and they must reach it by the back staircase or by the window in the dressingroom	58.71202401511646
The clock of the Invalides struck a quarter to twelve the west wind bore on its moistened gusts the doleful vibration of the three strokes	280.57997224424645
As the last stroke died away the count thought he heard a slight noise in the dressingroom this first sound or rather this first grinding was followed by a second then a third at the fourth the count knew what to expect	90.33903934528124
A firm and wellpractised hand was engaged in cutting the four sides of a pane of glass with a diamond	37.189713492875384
The count felt his heart beat more rapidly	79.19872835670853
Inured as men may be to danger forewarned as they may be of peril they understand by the fluttering of the heart and the shuddering of the frame the enormous difference between a dream and a reality between the project and the execution	144.64941894354322
However Monte Cristo only made a sign to apprise Ali who understanding that danger was approaching from the other side drew nearer to his master	58.76319299158658
Monte Cristo was eager to ascertain the strength and number of his enemies	107.83683518484058
The window whence the noise proceeded was opposite the opening by which the count could see into the dressingroom	62.260010881355186
He fixed his eyes on that windowhe distinguished a shadow in the darkness then one of the panes became quite opaque as if a sheet of paper were stuck on the outside then the square cracked without falling	173.14144727256462
Through the opening an arm was passed to find the fastening then a second the window turned on its hinges and a man entered	62.47533641672808
That s a daring rascal whispered the count	20.98805483423664
At that moment Ali touched him slightly on the shoulder	38.12061456034758
He turned Ali pointed to the window of the room in which they were facing the street	22.103774477851072
I see said he there are two of them one does the work while the other stands guard	154.44761759969376
He made a sign to Ali not to lose sight of the man in the street and turned to the one in the dressingroom	40.12871267766402
The glasscutter had entered and was feeling his way his arms stretched out before him	100.3895571494308
At last he appeared to have made himself familiar with his surroundings	195.15275168059694
There were two doors he bolted them both	1030.6458416246574
When he drew near to the bedroom door Monte Cristo expected that he was coming in and raised one of his pistols but he simply heard the sound of the bolts sliding in their copper rings	83.89254404878658
The nocturnal visitor ignorant of the fact that the count had removed the staples might now think himself at home and pursue his purpose with full security	142.46706892381854
Alone and free to act as he wished the man then drew from his pocket something which the count could not discern placed it on a stand then went straight to the secretaire felt the lock and contrary to his expectation found that the key was missing	90.42557878609654
But the glasscutter was a prudent man who had provided for all emergencies	138.8709849273016
The count soon heard the rattling of a bunch of skeleton keys such as the locksmith brings when called to force a lock and which thieves call nightingales doubtless from the music of their nightly song when they grind against the bolt	359.35046000743984
Ah ha whispered Monte Cristo with a smile of disappointment he is only a thief	39.0799370623157
But the man in the dark could not find the right key	392.70023430842195
He reached the instrument he had placed on the stand touched a spring and immediately a pale light just bright enough to render objects distinct was reflected on his hands and countenance	161.7240795804997
By heavens exclaimed Monte Cristo starting back it is	78.84366175287148
Do nt stir whispered Monte Cristo and put down your hatchet we shall require no arms	112.18308983305216
Then he added some words in a low tone for the exclamation which surprise had drawn from the count faint as it had been had startled the man who remained in the pose of the old knifegrinder	62.617799011815336
It was an order the count had just given for immediately Ali went noiselessly and returned bearing a black dress and a threecornered hat	147.1421073442984
Meanwhile Monte Cristo had rapidly taken off his greatcoat waistcoat and shirt and one might distinguish by the glimmering through the open panel that he wore a pliant tunic of steel mail of which the last in France where daggers are no longer dreaded was worn by King Louis XVI	183.90902878810112
who feared the dagger at his breast and whose head was cleft with a hatchet	86.24120460382349
The tunic soon disappeared under a long cassock as did his hair under a priests wig the threecornered hat over this effectually transformed the count into an abb	326.3093305387998
The man hearing nothing more stood erect and while Monte Cristo was completing his disguise had advanced straight to the secretaire whose lock was beginning to crack under his nightingale	332.4985509422643
Try again whispered the count who depended on the secret spring which was unknown to the picklock clever as he might betry again you have a few minutes work there	130.31930991797918
And he advanced to the window	78.29312568221918
The man whom he had seen seated on a fence had got down and was still pacing the street but strange as it appeared he cared not for those who might pass from the avenue of the Champslyses or by the Faubourg SaintHonor his attention was engrossed with what was passing at the counts and his only aim appeared to be to discern every movement in the dressingroom	89.81798573465424
Monte Cristo suddenly struck his finger on his forehead and a smile passed over his lips then drawing near to Ali he whispered	35.890624968747005
Remain here concealed in the dark and whatever noise you hear whatever passes only come in or show yourself if I call you	266.1779234826931
Ali bowed in token of strict obedience	1512.768595998837
Monte Cristo then drew a lighted taper from a closet and when the thief was deeply engaged with his lock silently opened the door taking care that the light should shine directly on his face	107.94639897635656
The door opened so quietly that the thief heard no sound but to his astonishment the room was suddenly illuminated	166.42293402282266
Caderousse said Monte Cristo what are you doing here at such an hour	17.386978937960716
The Abb Busoni exclaimed Caderousse and not knowing how this strange apparition could have entered when he had bolted the doors he let fall his bunch of keys and remained motionless and stupefied	93.95664012878227
The count placed himself between Caderousse and the window thus cutting off from the thief his only chance of retreat	273.90825297772
The Abb Busoni repeated Caderousse fixing his haggard gaze on the count	25.029547091427663
Yes undoubtedly the Abb Busoni himself replied Monte Cristo	11.363943833377661
And I am very glad you recognize me dear M	19.405495510392605
Caderousse it proves you have a good memory for it must be about ten years since we last met	42.16517459968914
This calmness of Busoni combined with his irony and boldness staggered Caderousse	573.0572820017534
The abb the abb murmured he clenching his fists and his teeth chattering	147.55488760543005
So you would rob the Count of Monte Cristo continued the false abb	32.469008536975146
Reverend sir murmured Caderousse seeking to regain the window which the count pitilessly blockedreverend sir I do nt knowbelieve meI take my oath	287.9879103864679
A pane of glass out continued the count a dark lantern a bunch of false keys a secretaire half forcedit is tolerably evident	257.0656001319994
Caderousse was choking he looked around for some corner to hide in some way of escape	59.37725400626565
Come come continued the count I see you are still the samean assassin	105.30157158562042
Reverend sir since you know everything you know it was not Iit was La Carconte that was proved at the trial since I was only condemned to the galleys	83.51402362737028
Is your time then expired since I find you in a fair way to return there	49.229871691686874
No reverend sir I have been liberated by someone	266.89037857863264
That someone has done society a great kindness	217.9501174457107
Ah said Caderousse I had promised	44.691133381857234
And you are breaking your promise interrupted Monte Cristo	141.63007491396513
Alas yes said Caderousse very uneasily	572.3812870557681
A bad relapse that will lead you if I mistake not to the Place de Grve	81.12347102949123
So much the worse so much the worsediavolo as they say in my country	100.68565129256318
Every criminal says the same thing	7.775010156792352
Pshaw said Busoni disdainfully poverty may make a man beg steal a loaf of bread at a bakers door but not cause him to open a secretaire in a house supposed to be inhabited	117.45911468547611
And when the jeweller Johannes had just paid you 45000 francs for the diamond I had given you and you killed him to get the diamond and the money both was that also poverty	87.09559810870316
Pardon reverend sir said Caderousse you have saved my life once save me again	66.30670579794487
Are you alone reverend sir or have you there soldiers ready to seize me	238.7936189421811
I am alone said the abb and I will again have pity on you and will let you escape at the risk of the fresh miseries my weakness may lead to if you tell me the truth	71.65398155570392
Ah reverend sir cried Caderousse clasping his hands and drawing nearer to Monte Cristo I may indeed say you are my deliverer	42.22746134363102
You mean to say you have been freed from confinement	260.73018515113574
Yes that is true reverend sir	109.678007244148
I know him I shall know if you lie	59.41225341956423
Ah reverend sir I tell you the simple truth	58.26028011441556
No not me but a young Corsican my companion	340.72372996131253
What was this young Corsicans name	237.25856623739114
He had no other he was a foundling	249.22658002761145
Then this young man escaped with you	30.98747284884594
We were working at SaintMandrier near Toulon	1624.0046204617122
In the hour of rest between noon and one oclock	232.00948943861317
Galleyslaves having a nap after dinner We may well pity the poor fellows said the abb	119.73635824123241
Nay said Caderousse one ca nt always workone is not a dog	47.08482541292236
So much the better for the dogs said Monte Cristo	23.13782912059242
While the rest slept then we went away a short distance we severed our fetters with a file the Englishman had given us and swam away	213.63647683217278
And what is become of this Benedetto	133.3950249301553
No in truth we parted at Hyres	2306.2039387309164
And to give more weight to his protestation Caderousse advanced another step towards the abb who remained motionless in his place as calm as ever and pursuing his interrogation	94.32602587472262
You lie said the Abb Busoni with a tone of irresistible authority	28.13104815310334
You lie This man is still your friend and you perhaps make use of him as your accomplice	69.73735726817719
Since you left Toulon what have you lived on Answer me	268.64071324996644
You lie repeated the abb a third time with a still more imperative tone	134.12811241650095
Caderousse terrified looked at the count	16.506532919000342
You have lived on the money he has given you	68.79774964572232
True said Caderousse Benedetto has become the son of a great lord	33.72426950029473
How can he be the son of a great lord	45.28647818802789
And what is that great lords name	806.8687460501075
The Count of Monte Cristo the very same in whose house we are	221.46151463215423
Benedetto the counts son replied Monte Cristo astonished in his turn	8.992752113800721
Well I should think so since the count has found him a false fathersince the count gives him four thousand francs a month and leaves him 500000 francs in his will	65.25632954022609
Ah yes said the factitious abb who began to understand and what name does the young man bear meanwhile	69.81539363450709
Is it then that young man whom my friend the Count of Monte Cristo has received into his house and who is going to marry Mademoiselle Danglars	18.583893913691202
And you suffer that you wretchyou who know his life and his crime	285.76421371113094
Why should I stand in a comrades way said Caderousse	123.08746529705962
You are right it is not you who should apprise M	151.92043267124228
Do not do so reverend sir	73.40334349137038
Because you would bring us to ruin	89.7061897370929
And you think that to save such villains as you I will become an abettor of their plot an accomplice in their crimes	262.2153077736161
Reverend sir said Caderousse drawing still nearer	789.0017188608709
By Heaven cried Caderousse drawing from his waistcoat an open knife and striking the count in the breast you shall disclose nothing reverend sir	99.28545857607979
To Caderousses great astonishment the knife instead of piercing the counts breast flew back blunted	482.6168876053129
At the same moment the count seized with his left hand the assassins wrist and wrung it with such strength that the knife fell from his stiffened fingers and Caderousse uttered a cry of pain	52.2096735582305
But the count disregarding his cry continued to wring the bandits wrist until his arm being dislocated he fell first on his knees then flat on the floor	181.79727347751418
The count then placed his foot on his head saying I know not what restrains me from crushing thy skull rascal	215.57454177703337
What a wrist you have reverend sir said Caderousse stroking his arm all bruised by the fleshy pincers which had held it what a wrist	328.7038424023735
Silence God gives me strength to overcome a wild beast like you in the name of that God I actremember that wretchand to spare thee at this moment is still serving him	160.65845864756443
Oh said Caderousse groaning with pain	380.54107587489347
Take this pen and paper and write what I dictate	149.21304235275724
I do nt know how to write reverend sir	301.7994045215543
You lie Take this pen and write	44.07832585692734
Caderousse awed by the superior power of the abb sat down and wrote	48.8103291218504
SirThe man whom you are receiving at your house and to whom you intend to marry your daughter is a felon who escaped with me from confinement at Toulon	77.4013268672142
He was called Benedetto but he is ignorant of his real name having never known his parents	107.71421751693246
If I sought your ruin fool I should drag you to the first guardhouse besides when that note is delivered in all probability you will have no more to fear	104.90368170566323
The address To monsieur the Baron Danglars banker Rue de la Chausse dAntin	40.59811348548509
You wish me to get out at that window	123.94862113990567
Oh you have some design against me reverend sir	249.60006826960768
Idiot what design can I have	15.827867555625758
Why then not let me out by the door	102.44442664559374
What would be the advantage of waking the porter	136.5249047542946
Ah reverend sir tell me do you wish me dead	27.53725362940973
But swear that you will not strike me as I go down	39.89145530492896
What do you intend doing with me	16.412341709688686
I ask you what can I do I have tried to make you a happy man and you have turned out a murderer	54.22903978342596
Oh monsieur said Caderousse make one more attempttry me once more	353.4409233536881
Listenyou know if I may be relied on	106.83715250239004
If you arrive safely at home	62.1802426957695
What have I to fear except from you	190.31174769887684
If you reach your home safely leave Paris leave France and wherever you may be so long as you conduct yourself well I will send you a small annuity for if you return home safely then	87.87351647113898
Then I shall believe God has forgiven you and I will forgive you too	35.19619828587654
As true as I am a Christian stammered Caderousse you will make me die of fright	119.76762948246045
Now begone said the count pointing to the window	37.21267462852794
Caderousse scarcely yet relying on this promise put his legs out of the window and stood on the ladder	49.589549054702466
Now go down said the abb folding his arms	122.73031202248151
Understanding he had nothing more to fear from him Caderousse began to go down	59.74183514346161
Then the count brought the taper to the window that it might be seen in the Champslyses that a man was getting out of the window while another held a light	47.93653586304557
What are you doing reverend sir Suppose a watchman should pass And he blew out the light	292.38492226683957
He then descended but it was only when he felt his foot touch the ground that he was satisfied of his safety	49.68514144643696
Monte Cristo returned to his bedroom and glancing rapidly from the garden to the street he saw first Caderousse who after walking to the end of the garden fixed his ladder against the wall at a different part from where he came in	64.18847899842932
The count then looking over into the street saw the man who appeared to be waiting run in the same direction and place himself against the angle of the wall where Caderousse would come over	53.67099069677608
Caderousse climbed the ladder slowly and looked over the coping to see if the street was quiet	87.86252562700734
No one could be seen or heard	226.20227793871362
The clock of the Invalides struck one	39.0452694214476
Then Caderousse sat astride the coping and drawing up his ladder passed it over the wall then he began to descend or rather to slide down by the two stanchions which he did with an ease which proved how accustomed he was to the exercise	81.9195129042545
But once started he could not stop	65.4702396628563
In vain did he see a man start from the shadow when he was halfway downin vain did he see an arm raised as he touched the ground	171.65179566485457
Before he could defend himself that arm struck him so violently in the back that he let go the ladder crying Help A second blow struck him almost immediately in the side and he fell calling Help murder Then as he rolled on the ground his adversary seized him by the hair and struck him a third blow in the chest	98.13889640802059
This time Caderousse endeavored to call again but he could only utter a groan and he shuddered as the blood flowed from his three wounds	99.67391826375575
The assassin finding that he no longer cried out lifted his head up by the hair his eyes were closed and the mouth was distorted	68.60788701546873
The murderer supposing him dead let fall his head and disappeared	25.993452685164296
Then Caderousse feeling that he was leaving him raised himself on his elbow and with a dying voice cried with great effort	44.06059193286092
Murder I am dying Help reverend sirhelp	16713.201594352795
This mournful appeal pierced the darkness	1275.4597893954358
The door of the backstaircase opened then the sidegate of the garden and Ali and his master were on the spot with lights	64.77643110925908
Caderousse continued to call piteously Help reverend sir help	1031.7965179921634
What is the matter asked Monte Cristo	2.12360410937712
Help cried Caderousse I am murdered	484.34637082571663
Ah its all over You are come too lateyou are come to see me die	106.06774473497585
Ali and his master conveyed the wounded man into a room	28.250435362042833
Monte Cristo motioned to Ali to undress him and he then examined his dreadful wounds	91.51689114310456
My God he exclaimed thy vengeance is sometimes delayed but only that it may fall the more effectually	187.93834403064665
Ali looked at his master for further instructions	1343.2448654662528
Bring here immediately the kings attorney M	13.098963251157533
de Villefort who lives in the Faubourg SaintHonor	39.053283842636304
As you pass the lodge wake the porter and send him for a surgeon	116.20093837302699
Ali obeyed leaving the abb alone with Caderousse who had not yet revived	62.57040004006124
When the wretched man again opened his eyes the count looked at him with a mournful expression of pity and his lips moved as if in prayer	35.82953702805486
A surgeon reverend sira surgeon said Caderousse	16.849408426173746
I have sent for one replied the abb	32.935310197959005
I know he can not save my life but he may strengthen me to give my evidence	77.6566234027281
After giving me the plan of this house doubtless hoping I should kill the count and he thus become his heir or that the count would kill me and I should be out of his way he waylaid me and has murdered me	73.92318316749147
I have also sent for the procureur	42.04533459211507
He will not come in time I feel my life fast ebbing	414.8550872787389
Wait a moment said Monte Cristo	1.0005780458514015
He left the room and returned in five minutes with a phial	40.73496100101537
The dying mans eyes were all the time riveted on the door through which he hoped succor would arrive	133.7615888646943
Hasten reverend sir hasten I shall faint again Monte Cristo approached and dropped on his purple lips three or four drops of the contents of the phial	39.59762319869388
Oh said he that is life to me more more	152.81886631637582
Two drops more would kill you replied the abb	31.424135828465594
Oh send for someone to whom I can denounce the wretch	118.56628886693788
Shall I write your deposition You can sign it	74.88967408911842
Yes yes said Caderousse and his eyes glistened at the thought of this posthumous revenge	105.87602701528048
I die murdered by the Corsican Benedetto my comrade in the galleys at Toulon No	323.8483172319314
Quick quick said Caderousse or I shall be unable to sign it	22.471476032568
Monte Cristo gave the pen to Caderousse who collected all his strength signed it and fell back on his bed saying	37.27120694152929
You will relate all the rest reverend sir you will say he calls himself Andrea Cavalcanti	179.14545397849315
He lodges at the Htel des Princes	2.04995207012238
Oh I am dying He again fainted	498.0690779331352
The abb made him smell the contents of the phial and he again opened his eyes	24.690696149492567
His desire for revenge had not forsaken him	167.5104784700268
Ah you will tell all I have said will you not reverend sir	42.46524475497186
I will say he had doubtless given you the plan of this house in the hope the count would kill you	49.86394053828543
I will say likewise he had apprised the count by a note of your intention and the count being absent I read the note and sat up to await you	112.12282618817294
And he will be guillotined will he not said Caderousse	75.97647013698409
Promise me that and I will die with that hope	40.120358461269376
I will say continued the count that he followed and watched you the whole time and when he saw you leave the house ran to the angle of the wall to conceal himself	43.690819924993654
Remember my words If you return home safely I shall believe God has forgiven you and I will forgive you also	69.17929594638034
And you did not warn me cried Caderousse raising himself on his elbows	66.93143366816139
You knew I should be killed on leaving this house and did not warn me	45.49475210391256
No for I saw Gods justice placed in the hands of Benedetto and should have thought it sacrilege to oppose the designs of Providence	89.91171455924597
Gods justice Speak not of it reverend sir	334.0590459852288
If God were just you know how many would be punished who now escape	150.9214138325004
Patience said the abb in a tone which made the dying man shudder have patience	36.91313608842722
Caderousse looked at him with amazement	127.63060168009008
Besides said the abb God is merciful to all as he has been to you he is first a father then a judge	81.8860238025402
Do you then believe in God said Caderousse	92.4297122620486
Had I been so unhappy as not to believe in him until now said Monte Cristo I must believe on seeing you	47.468342985071025
Caderousse raised his clenched hands towards heaven	7.516680764804371
Listen said the abb extending his hand over the wounded man as if to command him to believe this is what the God in whom on your deathbed you refuse to believe has done for youhe gave you health strength regular employment even friendsa life in fact which a man might enjoy with a calm conscience	154.54108285924272
Instead of improving these gifts rarely granted so abundantly this has been your courseyou have given yourself up to sloth and drunkenness and in a fit of intoxication have ruined your best friend	325.2811371494239
Help cried Caderousse I require a surgeon not a priest perhaps I am not mortally woundedI may not die perhaps they can yet save my life	140.73678465344526
Your wounds are so far mortal that without the three drops I gave you you would now be dead	74.0912059260616
Ah murmured Caderousse what a strange priest you are you drive the dying to despair instead of consoling them	186.58752829734186
When you had betrayed your friend God began not to strike but to warn you	150.17343681913331
You had already passed half your life in coveting that which you might have honorably acquired and already you contemplated crime under the excuse of want when God worked a miracle in your behalf sending you by my hands a fortunebrilliant indeed for you who had never possessed any	258.95802608415283
But this unexpected unhopedfor unheardof fortune sufficed you no longer when you once possessed it you wished to double it and howby a murder You succeeded and then God snatched it from you and brought you to justice	188.66292316480295
It was not I who wished to kill the Jew said Caderousse it was La Carconte	45.688446320119546
Yes said Monte Cristo and GodI can not say in justice for his justice would have slain youbut God in his mercy spared your life	225.08588428500408
Pardieu to transport me for life how merciful	4705.248806823173
You thought it a mercy then miserable wretch The coward who feared death rejoiced at perpetual disgrace for like all galleyslaves you said I may escape from prison I can not from the grave	304.78836058898617
And you said truly the way was opened for you unexpectedly	443.61988483536976
An Englishman visited Toulon who had vowed to rescue two men from infamy and his choice fell on you and your companion	139.43450590361405
You received a second fortune money and tranquillity were restored to you and you who had been condemned to a felons life might live as other men	132.98127240828518
Then wretched creature then you tempted God a third time	1101.6945448435338
I have not enough you said when you had more than you before possessed and you committed a third crime without reason without excuse	204.45893363039707
God is wearied he has punished you	301.1995404516331
Give me drink said he I thirstI burn Monte Cristo gave him a glass of water	76.71286605115752
And yet that villain Benedetto will escape	69.96376710063282
No one I tell you will escape Benedetto will be punished	119.65549614578617
Then you too will be punished for you did not do your duty as a priestyou should have prevented Benedetto from killing me	102.08688178159144
I said the count with a smile which petrified the dying man when you had just broken your knife against the coat of mail which protected my breast Yet perhaps if I had found you humble and penitent I might have prevented Benedetto from killing you but I found you proud and bloodthirsty and I left you in the hands of God	116.74552710844105
I do not believe there is a God howled Caderousse you do not believe it you lieyou lie	198.4683574670319
Silence said the abb you will force the last drop of blood from your veins	54.22904215378129
What you do not believe in God when he is striking you dead you will not believe in him who requires but a prayer a word a tear and he will forgive God who might have directed the assassins dagger so as to end your career in a moment has given you this quarter of an hour for repentance	121.2538966140623
Reflect then wretched man and repent	53560.082569528386
No said Caderousse no I will not repent	170.35660477971138
There is no God there is no Providenceall comes by chance	231.50558062044624
There is a Providence there is a God said Monte Cristo of whom you are a striking proof as you lie in utter despair denying him while I stand before you rich happy safe and entreating that God in whom you endeavor not to believe while in your heart you still believe in him	120.49323211981972
But who are you then asked Caderousse fixing his dying eyes on the count	43.92451637286075
Look well at me said Monte Cristo putting the light near his face	41.025742664298555
Monte Cristo took off the wig which disfigured him and let fall his black hair which added so much to the beauty of his pallid features	81.23680064856906
Oh said Caderousse thunderstruck but for that black hair I should say you were the Englishman Lord Wilmore	94.89728434176376
I am neither the Abb Busoni nor Lord Wilmore said Monte Cristo think againdo you not recollect me	42.2621339244892
There was a magic effect in the counts words which once more revived the exhausted powers of the miserable man	115.47398858047542
Yes indeed said he I think I have seen you and known you formerly	61.91903002163741
Yes Caderousse you have seen me you knew me once	61.923121542457245
Who then are you and why if you knew me do you let me die	23.03256283605732
Because nothing can save you your wounds are mortal	272.28075628269136
Had it been possible to save you I should have considered it another proof of Gods mercy and I would again have endeavored to restore you I swear by my fathers tomb	95.35916120171082
By your fathers tomb said Caderousse supported by a supernatural power and halfraising himself to see more distinctly the man who had just taken the oath which all men hold sacred who then are you	120.91532995254695
The count had watched the approach of death	67.30079505375099
He knew this was the last struggle	427.6760687263486
He approached the dying man and leaning over him with a calm and melancholy look he whispered I amI am	71.34104684807717
And his almost closed lips uttered a name so low that the count himself appeared afraid to hear it	120.35762893309983
Caderousse who had raised himself on his knees and stretched out his arm tried to draw back then clasping his hands and raising them with a desperate effort Oh my God my God said he pardon me for having denied thee thou dost exist thou art indeed mans father in heaven and his judge on earth	71.31224025076281
My God my Lord I have long despised thee Pardon me my God receive me Oh my Lord	271.5638985495905
Caderousse sighed deeply and fell back with a groan	30.095213392288148
The blood no longer flowed from his wounds	36.12084899862522
One said the count mysteriously his eyes fixed on the corpse disfigured by so awful a death	48.102944823220746
Ten minutes afterwards the surgeon and the procureur arrived the one accompanied by the porter the other by Ali and were received by the Abb Busoni who was praying by the side of the corpse	34.68998763992186
The daring attempt to rob the count was the topic of conversation throughout Paris for the next fortnight	102.13952214434352
The dying man had signed a deposition declaring Benedetto to be the assassin	283.00446556001174
The police had orders to make the strictest search for the murderer	136.63288434974285
Caderousses knife dark lantern bunch of keys and clothing excepting the waistcoat which could not be found were deposited at the registry the corpse was conveyed to the morgue	159.49373834792428
The count told everyone that this adventure had happened during his absence at Auteuil and that he only knew what was related by the Abb Busoni who that evening by mere chance had requested to pass the night in his house to examine some valuable books in his library	61.77453330847024
Bertuccio alone turned pale whenever Benedettos name was mentioned in his presence but there was no reason why anyone should notice his doing so	100.0880918996569
Villefort being called on to prove the crime was preparing his brief with the same ardor that he was accustomed to exercise when required to speak in criminal cases	137.84087376786505
But three weeks had already passed and the most diligent search had been unsuccessful the attempted robbery and the murder of the robber by his comrade were almost forgotten in anticipation of the approaching marriage of Mademoiselle Danglars to the Count Andrea Cavalcanti	134.59605377566726
It was expected that this wedding would shortly take place as the young man was received at the bankers as the betrothed	73.509202342881
Letters had been despatched to M	169.56040389768938
Cavalcanti as the counts father who highly approved of the union regretted his inability to leave Parma at that time and promised a wedding gift of a hundred and fifty thousand livres	158.9172280531409
It was agreed that the three millions should be intrusted to Danglars to invest some persons had warned the young man of the circumstances of his future fatherinlaw who had of late sustained repeated losses but with sublime disinterestedness and confidence the young man refused to listen or to express a single doubt to the baron	157.65596363517255
The baron adored Count Andrea Cavalcanti not so Mademoiselle Eugnie Danglars	39.478006875304246
With an instinctive hatred of matrimony she suffered Andreas attentions in order to get rid of Morcerf but when Andrea urged his suit she betrayed an entire dislike to him	273.9963437459659
The baron might possibly have perceived it but attributing it to a caprice feigned ignorance	615.9249954600145
The delay demanded by Beauchamp had nearly expired	440.1037711162679
Morcerf appreciated the advice of Monte Cristo to let things die away of their own accord	60.26378839247907
No one had taken up the remark about the general and no one had recognized in the officer who betrayed the castle of Yanina the noble count in the House of Peers	67.75791915563522
Albert however felt no less insulted the few lines which had irritated him were certainly intended as an insult	155.37381844652296
Besides the manner in which Beauchamp had closed the conference left a bitter recollection in his heart	138.03948889505375
He cherished the thought of the duel hoping to conceal its true cause even from his seconds	183.54074308788472
Beauchamp had not been seen since the day he visited Albert and those of whom the latter inquired always told him he was out on a journey which would detain him some days	99.58355487386842
Where he was no one knew	685.3137132592501
One morning Albert was awakened by his valet de chambre who announced Beauchamp	17.239974718629743
Albert rubbed his eyes ordered his servant to introduce him into the small smokingroom on the ground floor dressed himself quickly and went down	65.07902237805521
He found Beauchamp pacing the room on perceiving him Beauchamp stopped	139.09798290309533
Your arrival here without waiting my visit at your house today looks well sir said Albert	93.2461109121874
Tell me may I shake hands with you saying Beauchamp acknowledge you have injured me and retain my friendship or must I simply propose to you a choice of arms	159.27556109851625
Albert said Beauchamp with a look of sorrow which stupefied the young man let us first sit down and talk	65.59630130048735
Rather sir before we sit down I must demand your answer	76.28942697951764
Albert said the journalist these are questions which it is difficult to answer	51.01314050731735
I will facilitate it by repeating the question Will you or will you not retract	153.2151967196964
Morcerf it is not enough to answer yes or no to questions which concern the honor the social interest and the life of such a man as Lieutenantgnral the Count of Morcerf peer of France	111.17587295698651
I reasoned thusmoney time and fatigue are nothing compared with the reputation and interests of a whole family probabilities will not suffice only facts will justify a deadly combat with a friend	266.392093740479
If I strike with the sword or discharge the contents of a pistol at man with whom for three years I have been on terms of intimacy I must at least know why I do so I must meet him with a heart at ease and that quiet conscience which a man needs when his own arm must save his life	68.7100265457559
Well said Morcerf impatiently what does all this mean	132.22823352857415
It means that I have just returned from Yanina	124.63572541497312
Here is my passport examine the visaGeneva Milan Venice Trieste Delvino Yanina	5686.76569118044
Will you believe the government of a republic a kingdom and an empire Albert cast his eyes on the passport then raised them in astonishment to Beauchamp	125.11171353532586
You have been to Yanina said he	6.358109139766688
Albert had you been a stranger a foreigner a simple lord like that Englishman who came to demand satisfaction three or four months since and whom I killed to get rid of I should not have taken this trouble but I thought this mark of consideration due to you	94.72713281348103
I took a week to go another to return four days of quarantine and fortyeight hours to stay there that makes three weeks	236.59199195759584
I returned last night and here I am	43.97261051302923
What circumlocution How long you are before you tell me what I most wish to know	43.8574488245446
You fear to acknowledge that your correspondent has deceived you Oh no selflove Beauchamp	209.15672095726538
Acknowledge it Beauchamp your courage can not be doubted	46.18526987927209
Not so murmured the journalist on the contrary	21.459265848877013
Albert turned frightfully pale he endeavored to speak but the words died on his lips	35.89375071249474
My friend said Beauchamp in the most affectionate tone I should gladly make an apology but alas	134.29740345833332
The paragraph was correct my friend	37.433248581721664
The traitor who surrendered the castle of the man in whose service he was	40.371717386497174
Pardon me my friend that man was your father	138.76248016502495
Albert advanced furiously towards Beauchamp but the latter restrained him more by a mild look than by his extended hand	127.2811011874998
My friend said he here is a proof of it	13.278099394356493
Albert opened the paper it was an attestation of four notable inhabitants of Yanina proving that Colonel Fernand Mondego in the service of Ali Tepelini had surrendered the castle for two million crowns	129.43895135735656
Albert tottered and fell overpowered in a chair	7.741688471997323
It could no longer be doubted the family name was fully given	211.72336395516913
After a moments mournful silence his heart overflowed and he gave way to a flood of tears	106.14874274666724
Beauchamp who had watched with sincere pity the young mans paroxysm of grief approached him	196.69944666651156
Now Albert said he you understand medo you not I wished to see all and to judge of everything for myself hoping the explanation would be in your fathers favor and that I might do him justice	95.1788014527559
But on the contrary the particulars which are given prove that Fernand Mondego raised by Ali Pasha to the rank of governorgeneral is no other than Count Fernand of Morcerf then recollecting the honor you had done me in admitting me to your friendship I hastened to you	131.98546789905794
Albert still extended on the chair covered his face with both hands as if to prevent the light from reaching him	39.54231322254466
I hastened to you continued Beauchamp to tell you Albert that in this changing age the faults of a father can not revert upon his children	123.15053768445117
Few have passed through this revolutionary period in the midst of which we were born without some stain of infamy or blood to soil the uniform of the soldier or the gown of the magistrate	98.50855000952818
Now I have these proofs Albert and I am in your confidence no human power can force me to a duel which your own conscience would reproach you with as criminal but I come to offer you what you can no longer demand of me	92.44257392706456
Do you wish these proofs these attestations which I alone possess to be destroyed Do you wish this frightful secret to remain with us Confided to me it shall never escape my lips say Albert my friend do you wish it	108.22595738699079
Albert threw himself on Beauchamps neck	774.0102389201992
Take these said Beauchamp presenting the papers to Albert	64.86829153391083
Albert seized them with a convulsive hand tore them in pieces and trembling lest the least vestige should escape and one day appear to confront him he approached the waxlight always kept burning for cigars and burned every fragment	297.7088579885688
Dear excellent friend murmured Albert still burning the papers	193.0741781181757
Let all be forgotten as a sorrowful dream said Beauchamp let it vanish as the last sparks from the blackened paper and disappear as the smoke from those silent ashes	224.36917685009536
Yes yes said Albert and may there remain only the eternal friendship which I promised to my deliverer which shall be transmitted to our childrens children and shall always remind me that I owe my life and the honor of my name to youfor had this been known oh Beauchamp I should have destroyed myself orno my poor mother I could not have killed her by the same blowI should have fled from my country	133.1519824913868
But this sudden and factitious joy soon forsook the young man and was succeeded by a still greater grief	132.99525328611853
Well said Beauchamp what still oppresses you my friend	241.6150999055021
Listen Beauchamp I can not thus in a moment relinquish the respect the confidence and pride with which a fathers untarnished name inspires a son	406.50437547540145
Oh Beauchamp Beauchamp how shall I now approach mine Shall I draw back my forehead from his embrace or withhold my hand from his I am the most wretched of men	160.2653707278154
Ah my mother my poor mother said Albert gazing through his tears at his mothers portrait if you know this how much must you suffer	81.33880219190121
Come said Beauchamp taking both his hands take courage my friend	175.02371559089332
But how came that first note to be inserted in your journal Some unknown enemyan invisible foehas done this	1057.4867304799532
The more must you fortify yourself Albert	186.4676073539114
Let no trace of emotion be visible on your countenance bear your grief as the cloud bears within it ruin and deatha fatal secret known only when the storm bursts	541.4058630900547
Go my friend reserve your strength for the moment when the crash shall come	104.16009717241862
You think then all is not over yet said Albert horrorstricken	558.6179786087439
I think nothing my friend but all things are possible	117.8863001666435
What said Albert seeing that Beauchamp hesitated	586.269333152156
Are you going to marry Mademoiselle Danglars	3.416177008648716
Why do you ask me now	194.79186864226762
Because the rupture or fulfilment of this engagement is connected with the person of whom we were speaking	56.13157865439073
How said Albert whose brow reddened you think M	840.8652203847901
I ask you only how your engagement stands Pray put no construction on my words I do not mean they should convey and give them no undue weight	295.64746129464504
said Albert the engagement is broken off	211.14624199608937
Then seeing the young man was about to relapse into melancholy Let us go out Albert said he a ride in the wood in the phaeton or on horseback will refresh you we will then return to breakfast and you shall attend to your affairs and I to mine	93.25064431196336
Willingly said Albert but let us walk	42.17359138365832
I think a little exertion would do me good	202.54794510829214
The two friends walked out on the fortress	92.8442157414106
When they arrived at the Madeleine	4065.016311601552
Since we are out said Beauchamp let us call on M	31.667595561841356
de Monte Cristo he is admirably adapted to revive ones spirits because he never interrogates and in my opinion those who ask no questions are the best comforters	419.2170095345582
Gladly said Albert let us callI love him	1603.603460244908
Monte Cristo uttered a joyful exclamation on seeing the young men together	47.89064372156411
Ah ha said he I hope all is over explained and settled	445.57806206521656
Yes said Beauchamp the absurd reports have died away and should they be renewed I would be the first to oppose them so let us speak no more of it	70.92213731659373
Albert will tell you replied the count that I gave him the same advice	29.032919738200132
I am finishing the most execrable mornings work	10597.85801763415
What is it said Albert arranging your papers apparently	1200.211124125699
My papers thank God nomy papers are all in capital order because I have none but M	98.07830851369806
Yes do you not know that this is a young man whom the count is introducing said Morcerf	44.43229860174444
Let us not misunderstand each other replied Monte Cristo I introduce no one and certainly not M	59.98318942328671
And who said Albert with a forced smile is to marry Mademoiselle Danglars instead of me which grieves me cruelly	88.54374666205061
What Cavalcanti is going to marry Mademoiselle Danglars asked Beauchamp	19.629688857691956
Certainly do you come from the end of the world said Monte Cristo you a journalist the husband of renown It is the talk of all Paris	49.419691881627045
And you count have made this match asked Beauchamp	142.3828361089959
I Silence purveyor of gossip do not spread that report	292.1345208652775
I make a match No you do not know me I have done all in my power to oppose it	19.667971891598643
Ah I understand said Beauchamp on our friend Alberts account	1481.577382848241
On my account said the young man oh no indeed the count will do me the justice to assert that I have on the contrary always entreated him to break off my engagement and happily it is ended	59.84383596800716
The count pretends I have not him to thankso be itI will erect an altar Deo ignoto	2445.025425981173
Listen said Monte Cristo I have had little to do with it for I am at variance both with the fatherinlaw and the young man there is only Mademoiselle Eugnie who appears but little charmed with the thoughts of matrimony and who seeing how little I was disposed to persuade her to renounce her dear liberty retains any affection for me	103.00869568233628
And do you say this wedding is at hand	246.17395676648258
Oh yes in spite of all I could say	35.122413922119186
I do not know the young man he is said to be of good family and rich but I never trust to vague assertions	140.6523437998886
Danglars of it till I am tired but he is fascinated with his Luccanese	142.4583045591642
I have even informed him of a circumstance I consider very serious the young man was either charmed by his nurse stolen by gypsies or lost by his tutor I scarcely know which	168.04185917496403
But I do know his father lost sight of him for more than ten years what he did during these ten years God only knows	69.66309378847137
They have commissioned me to write to the major to demand papers and here they are	131.48198665927612
I send them but like Pilatewashing my hands	1756.732445860758
And what does Mademoiselle dArmilly say to you for robbing her of her pupil	171.8034058922394
Oh well I do nt know but I understand that she is going to Italy	32.62698908479165
Madame Danglars asked me for letters of recommendation for the impresari I gave her a few lines for the director of the Valle Theatre who is under some obligation to me	151.54435041800465
But what is the matter Albert you look dull are you after all unconsciously in love with Mademoiselle Eugnie	252.14307507185694
I am not aware of it said Albert smiling sorrowfully	67.2602601651396
Beauchamp turned to look at some paintings	1631.337522546698
But continued Monte Cristo you are not in your usual spirits	46.12094192082837
I have a dreadful headache said Albert	55.66674626422044
Well my dear viscount said Monte Cristo I have an infallible remedy to propose to you	22.42230484931018
What is that asked the young man	3.5744750066497075
Yes and as I am just now excessively annoyed I shall go from home	138.2542151320196
You annoyed count said Beauchamp and by what	113.2234120517796
Ah you think very lightly of it I should like to see you with a brief preparing in your house	68.09069221546423
de Villefort is preparing against my amiable assassinsome brigand escaped from the gallows apparently	1339.869485219133
True said Beauchamp I saw it in the paper	26.20537019517034
de Villefort heard of him at Marseilles and M	63.76077913179243
Consequently the procureur is very active in the affair and the prefect of police very much interested and thanks to that interest for which I am very grateful they send me all the robbers of Paris and the neighborhood under pretence of their being Caderousses murderers so that in three months if this continues every robber and assassin in France will have the plan of my house at his fingers ends	128.382684960208
I am resolved to desert them and go to some remote corner of the earth and shall be happy if you will accompany me viscount	67.79950951366672
I have told you where the air is pure where every sound soothes where one is sure to be humbled however proud may be his nature	356.1744316520552
I love that humiliation I who am master of the universe as was Augustus	181.63202555878175
But where are you really going	199.08391997436507
To sea viscount you know I am a sailor	37.18552786139567
I was rocked when an infant in the arms of old Ocean and on the bosom of the beautiful Amphitrite I have sported with the green mantle of the one and the azure robe of the other I love the sea as a mistress and pine if I do not often see her	90.43726409257093
Well viscount there will be in my courtyard this evening a good travelling britzka with four posthorses in which one may rest as in a bed	244.74452089252205
Beauchamp it holds four very well will you accompany us	80.49843270786391
Thank you I have just returned from sea	171.2889187021316
What you have been to sea	3649.3483135895326
Yes I have just made a little excursion to the Borromean Islands18	268.87234080755024
What of that come with us said Albert	51.44365578799578
No dear Morcerf you know I only refuse when the thing is impossible	133.57964672001214
Besides it is important added he in a low tone that I should remain in Paris just now to watch the paper	31.971476620660447
Ah you are a good and an excellent friend said Albert yes you are right watch watch Beauchamp and try to discover the enemy who made this disclosure	103.51488487389155
Albert and Beauchamp parted the last pressure of their hands expressing what their tongues could not before a stranger	204.81767079806517
Beauchamp is a worthy fellow said Monte Cristo when the journalist was gone is he not Albert	99.33264255081588
Yes and a sincere friend I love him devotedly	321.2624534036988
But now we are alonealthough it is immaterial to mewhere are we going	169.39207638164572
Delightful shall we be quite retired have no society no neighbors	663.5566460628472
Our companions will be ridinghorses dogs to hunt with and a fishingboat	451.33781652355253
Exactly what I wish for I will apprise my mother of my intention and return to you	43.4261846735299
But shall you be allowed to go into Normandy	78.56686017959693
I may go where I please	727.7407262329908
Yes I am aware you may go alone since I once met you in Italybut to accompany the mysterious Monte Cristo	92.21820422965742
You forget count that I have often told you of the deep interest my mother takes in you	64.30564816907703
woman is like a wave of the sea said Shakespeare both the great king and the great poet ought to have known womans nature well	215.12867184689583
Womans yes my mother is not woman but a woman	107.10069578553235
As I am only a humble foreigner you must pardon me if I do not understand all the subtle refinements of your language	86.91416298666314
What I mean to say is that my mother is not quick to give her confidence but when she does she never changes	71.18135720118777
Ah yes indeed said Monte Cristo with a sigh and do you think she is in the least interested in me	23.509299759588945
I repeat it you must really be a very strange and superior man for my mother is so absorbed by the interest you have excited that when I am with her she speaks of no one else	79.35268912109618
And does she try to make you dislike me	39.44891832520452
On the contrary she often says Morcerf I believe the count has a noble nature try to gain his esteem	102.7984521434993
You see then said Albert that instead of opposing she will encourage me	256.497247518429
Adieu then until five oclock be punctual and we shall arrive at twelve or one	86.58399254993027
But can we travel fortyeight leagues in eight hours	114.44686971668277
You are certainly a prodigy you will soon not only surpass the railway which would not be very difficult in France but even the telegraph	78.19662041848338
But viscount since we can not perform the journey in less than seven or eight hours do not keep me waiting	61.78575138620751
Do not fear I have little to prepare	432.6895588511057
Monte Cristo smiled as he nodded to Albert then remained a moment absorbed in deep meditation	396.6375646184551
But passing his hand across his forehead as if to dispel his reverie he rang the bell twice and Bertuccio entered	45.756713983089575
Bertuccio said he I intend going this evening to Normandy instead of tomorrow or the next day	89.72720330893738
You will have sufficient time before five oclock despatch a messenger to apprise the grooms at the first station	178.26259501033144
Bertuccio obeyed and despatched a courier to Pontoise to say the travellingcarriage would arrive at six oclock	206.04162630219432
From Pontoise another express was sent to the next stage and in six hours all the horses stationed on the road were ready	58.960326896366475
Before his departure the count went to Haydes apartments told her his intention and resigned everything to her care	237.9953983017941
The journey soon became interesting from its rapidity of which Morcerf had formed no previous idea	178.91770334088778
Truly said Monte Cristo with your posthorses going at the rate of two leagues an hour and that absurd law that one traveller shall not pass another without permission so that an invalid or illtempered traveller may detain those who are well and active it is impossible to move I escape this annoyance by travelling with my own postilion and horses do I not Ali	176.96984094369543
The count put his head out of the window and whistled and the horses appeared to fly	37.547314881411154
The carriage rolled with a thundering noise over the pavement and everyone turned to notice the dazzling meteor	285.9106487732887
Ali smiling repeated the sound grasped the reins with a firm hand and spurred his horses whose beautiful manes floated in the breeze	198.2000389539365
This child of the desert was in his element and with his black face and sparkling eyes appeared in the cloud of dust he raised like the genius of the simoom and the god of the hurricane	61.06875508737789
I never knew till now the delight of speed said Morcerf and the last cloud disappeared from his brow but where the devil do you get such horses Are they made to order	89.30756723141079
Precisely said the count six years since I bought a horse in Hungary remarkable for its swiftness	208.024000095281
The thirtytwo that we shall use tonight are its progeny they are all entirely black with the exception of a star upon the forehead	145.2063670666974
That is perfectly admirable but what do you do count with all these horses	43.90093314192767
You see I travel with them	136.475789426614
But you are not always travelling	4205.115684180789
When I no longer require them Bertuccio will sell them and he expects to realize thirty or forty thousand francs by the sale	134.60027350370757
But no monarch in Europe will be wealthy enough to purchase them	65.42529690482738
Then he will sell them to some Eastern vizier who will empty his coffers to purchase them and refill them by applying the bastinado to his subjects	229.71243392918757
Count may I suggest one idea to you	96.48554052116157
It is that next to you Bertuccio must be the richest gentleman in Europe	165.11094405330869
You are mistaken viscount I believe he has not a franc in his possession	118.51806492337623
Then he must be a wonder	7269.614270030908
My dear count if you tell me many more marvellous things I warn you I shall not believe them	43.22893422980682
I countenance nothing that is marvellous M	1579.737663115893
Tell me why does a steward rob his master	930.9656773858281
Because I suppose it is his nature to do so for the love of robbing	72.25947581947179
You are mistaken it is because he has a wife and family and ambitious desires for himself and them	154.26071252050548
Also because he is not sure of always retaining his situation and wishes to provide for the future	178.81781157172836
Bertuccio is alone in the world he uses my property without accounting for the use he makes of it he is sure never to leave my service	166.06729314551953
Because I should never get a better	53.605160728382806
But I deal in certainties he is the best servant over whom one has the power of life and death	47.661055804193815
Do you possess that right over Bertuccio	1185.2276259263106
There are words which close a conversation with an iron door such was the counts yes	155.5585807926416
The whole journey was performed with equal rapidity the thirtytwo horses dispersed over seven stages brought them to their destination in eight hours	289.1523167368098
At midnight they arrived at the gate of a beautiful park	48.41999139374255
The porter was in attendance he had been apprised by the groom of the last stage of the counts approach	46.020626090138684
At half past two in the morning Morcerf was conducted to his apartments where a bath and supper were prepared	86.41238156013783
The servant who had travelled at the back of the carriage waited on him Baptistin who rode in front attended the count	77.43824307829087
Albert bathed took his supper and went to bed	8.37120259024546
All night he was lulled by the melancholy noise of the surf	60.742781845331066
On rising he went to his window which opened on a terrace having the sea in front and at the back a pretty park bounded by a small forest	120.10255735033999
In a creek lay a little sloop with a narrow keel and high masts bearing on its flag the Monte Cristo arms which were a mountain or on a sea azure with a cross gules in chief which might be an allusion to his name that recalled Calvary the mount rendered by our Lords passion more precious than gold and to the degrading cross which his blood had rendered holy or it might be some personal remembrance of suffering and regeneration buried in the night of this mysterious personages past life	239.7363482160207
Around the schooner lay a number of small fishingboats belonging to the fishermen of the neighboring village like humble subjects awaiting orders from their queen	363.9377695941434
There as in every spot where Monte Cristo stopped if but for two days luxury abounded and life went on with the utmost ease	187.65719036523305
Albert found in his anteroom two guns with all the accoutrements for hunting a lofty room on the ground floor containing all the ingenious instruments the Englisheminent in piscatory pursuits since they are patient and sluggishhave invented for fishing	481.1627709641501
The day passed in pursuing those exercises in which Monte Cristo excelled	289.31271829889715
They killed a dozen pheasants in the park as many trout in the stream dined in a summerhouse overlooking the ocean and took tea in the library	195.66426402429292
Towards the evening of the third day	52.56412578867287
Albert completely exhausted with the exercise which invigorated Monte Cristo was sleeping in an armchair near the window while the count was designing with his architect the plan of a conservatory in his house when the sound of a horse at full speed on the high road made Albert look up	79.91781644848828
He was disagreeably surprised to see his own valet de chambre whom he had not brought that he might not inconvenience Monte Cristo	37.645645372227854
Florentin here cried he starting up is my mother ill And he hastened to the door	81.49469132300185
Monte Cristo watched and saw him approach the valet who drew a small sealed parcel from his pocket containing a newspaper and a letter	59.13293499314247
From whom is this said he eagerly	123.87646223713628
Yes sir he sent for me to his house gave me money for my journey procured a horse and made me promise not to stop till I had reached you I have come in fifteen hours	64.16244611214576
Albert opened the letter with fear uttered a shriek on reading the first line and seized the paper	151.8850422498774
His sight was dimmed his legs sank under him and he would have fallen had not Florentin supported him	110.03821254454775
Poor young man said Monte Cristo in a low voice it is then true that the sin of the father shall fall on the children to the third and fourth generation	47.63437463830791
Meanwhile Albert had revived and continuing to read he threw back his head saying	85.64903945720403
Florentin is your horse fit to return immediately	95.43990222988965
It is a poor lame posthorse	115216.9886023165
In what state was the house when you left	103.2705730364866
All was quiet but on returning from M	82.19967885343189
Beauchamps I found madame in tears she had sent for me to know when you would return	62.257696152793926
I told her my orders from M	85.47706958328787
Beauchamp she first extended her arms to prevent me but after a moments reflection Yes go Florentin said she and may he come quickly	189.72954699068111
Yes my mother said Albert I will return and woe to the infamous wretch But first of all I must get there	124.37632488938242
He went back to the room where he had left Monte Cristo	12.983926094479008
Five minutes had sufficed to make a complete transformation in his appearance	85.85727958081544
His voice had become rough and hoarse his face was furrowed with wrinkles his eyes burned under the blueveined lids and he tottered like a drunken man	158.5548915128602
Count said he I thank you for your hospitality which I would gladly have enjoyed longer but I must return to Paris	68.82514686911367
A great misfortune more important to me than life	47.726437487033316
Do nt question me I beg of you but lend me a horse	30.287873903796676
My stables are at your command viscount but you will kill yourself by riding on horseback	94.94804189537675
Take a postchaise or a carriage	383.4108655157444
No it would delay me and I need the fatigue you warn me of it will do me good	64.63771859829696
Albert reeled as if he had been shot and fell on a chair near the door	19.115233793341634
Monte Cristo did not see this second manifestation of physical exhaustion he was at the window calling	287.2690935415805
de Morcerfquick he is in a hurry	35.3984415507763
These words restored Albert he darted from the room followed by the count	20.07353642213422
Thank you cried he throwing himself on his horse	24.100364283749656
Return as soon as you can Florentin	2200.2074797864457
Must I use any password to procure a horse	56.534643379981155
Only dismount another will be immediately saddled	7754.47674765359
You may think my departure strange and foolish said the young man you do not know how a paragraph in a newspaper may exasperate one	87.06355058162382
Read that said he when I am gone that you may not be witness of my anger	59.40049823526902
While the count picked up the paper he put spurs to his horse which leaped in astonishment at such an unusual stimulus and shot away with the rapidity of an arrow	82.80012430328073
The count watched him with a feeling of compassion and when he had completely disappeared read as follows	100.15819373757444
The French officer in the service of Ali Pasha of Yanina alluded to three weeks since in lImpartial who not only surrendered the castle of Yanina but sold his benefactor to the Turks styled himself truly at that time Fernand as our esteemed contemporary states but he has since added to his Christian name a title of nobility and a family name	138.32076491188369
He now calls himself the Count of Morcerf and ranks among the peers	89.79941417675907
Thus the terrible secret which Beauchamp had so generously destroyed appeared again like an armed phantom and another paper deriving its information from some malicious source had published two days after Alberts departure for Normandy the few lines which had rendered the unfortunate young man almost crazy	341.00927453847993
At eight oclock in the morning Albert had arrived at Beauchamps door	47.721560265159376
The valet de chambre had received orders to usher him in at once	128.3190728198469
Well my poor friend replied Beauchamp I expected you	50.03782910203605
I need not say I think you are too faithful and too kind to have spoken of that painful circumstance	66.40420832609651
Your having sent for me is another proof of your affection	70.89884139849664
So without losing time tell me have you the slightest idea whence this terrible blow proceeds	282.43021403863975
I think I have some clew	16348.725963201841
But first tell me all the particulars of this shameful plot	103.00365086648078
Beauchamp proceeded to relate to the young man who was overwhelmed with shame and grief the following facts	33.369747900337174
Two days previously the article had appeared in another paper besides   lImpartial and what was more serious one that was well known as a government paper	230.23429167380186
Beauchamp was breakfasting when he read the paragraph	89.46391946064574
He sent immediately for a cabriolet and hastened to the publishers office	188.08279265528617
Although professing diametrically opposite principles from those of the editor of the other paper Beauchampas it sometimes we may say often happenswas his intimate friend	292.9869296111844
The editor was reading with apparent delight a leading article in the same paper on beetsugar probably a composition of his own	273.9414346359918
Ah pardieu said Beauchamp with the paper in your hand my friend I need not tell you the cause of my visit	29.398302502498424
Are you interested in the sugar question asked the editor of the ministerial paper	419.3711597798532
No replied Beauchamp I have not considered the question a totally different subject interests me	414.30981778899604
Indeed Is it not a curious affair	445.49315876599604
So curious that I think you are running a great risk of a prosecution for defamation of character	275.4245701477033
Not at all we have received with the information all the requisite proofs and we are quite sure M	158.16095125829403
de Morcerf will not raise his voice against us besides it is rendering a service to ones country to denounce these wretched criminals who are unworthy of the honor bestowed on them	178.50533456627048
Who then has so correctly informed you asked he for my paper which gave the first information on the subject has been obliged to stop for want of proof and yet we are more interested than you in exposing M	85.55046882006586
de Morcerf as he is a peer of France and we are of the opposition	56.160082526750685
Oh that is very simple we have not sought to scandalize	170.63770409250534
This news was brought to us	61.88149916861706
A man arrived yesterday from Yanina bringing a formidable array of documents and when we hesitated to publish the accusatory article he told us it should be inserted in some other paper	189.6621475241502
Beauchamp understood that nothing remained but to submit and left the office to despatch a courier to Morcerf	209.86808534283438
But he had been unable to send to Albert the following particulars as the events had transpired after the messengers departure namely that the same day a great agitation was manifest in the House of Peers among the usually calm members of that dignified assembly	193.2794296965553
Everyone had arrived almost before the usual hour and was conversing on the melancholy event which was to attract the attention of the public towards one of their most illustrious colleagues	89.81232726876705
Some were perusing the article others making comments and recalling circumstances which substantiated the charges still more	1550.598504647412
The Count of Morcerf was no favorite with his colleagues	317.2349745931284
Like all upstarts he had had recourse to a great deal of haughtiness to maintain his position	135.02704677436662
The true nobility laughed at him the talented repelled him and the honorable instinctively despised him	485.0486342304651
He was in fact in the unhappy position of the victim marked for sacrifice the finger of God once pointed at him everyone was prepared to raise the hue and cry	116.90627569290601
The Count of Morcerf alone was ignorant of the news	75.82526757751162
He did not take in the paper containing the defamatory article and had passed the morning in writing letters and in trying a horse	138.072353536093
He arrived at his usual hour with a proud look and insolent demeanor he alighted passed through the corridors and entered the house without observing the hesitation of the doorkeepers or the coolness of his colleagues	106.9372717740665
Business had already been going on for half an hour when he entered	27.336200973732094
Everyone held the accusing paper but as usual no one liked to take upon himself the responsibility of the attack	92.89549582477656
At length an honorable peer Morcerfs acknowledged enemy ascended the tribune with that solemnity which announced that the expected moment had arrived	420.8246939480085
There was an impressive silence Morcerf alone knew not why such profound attention was given to an orator who was not always listened to with so much complacency	158.8208558655908
The count did not notice the introduction in which the speaker announced that his communication would be of that vital importance that it demanded the undivided attention of the House but at the mention of Yanina and Colonel Fernand he turned so frightfully pale that every member shuddered and fixed his eyes upon him	168.02798038056918
Moral wounds have this peculiaritythey may be hidden but they never close always painful always ready to bleed when touched they remain fresh and open in the heart	287.8927338455842
The article having been read during the painful hush that followed a universal shudder pervaded the assembly and immediately the closest attention was given to the orator as he resumed his remarks	237.73236285264733
He stated his scruples and the difficulties of the case it was the honor of M	43.010018159079586
de Morcerf and that of the whole House he proposed to defend by provoking a debate on personal questions which are always such painful themes of discussion	416.28717130113455
He concluded by calling for an investigation which might dispose of the calumnious report before it had time to spread and restore M	339.8944594890827
de Morcerf to the position he had long held in public opinion	144.5652268422855
Morcerf was so completely overwhelmed by this great and unexpected calamity that he could scarcely stammer a few words as he looked around on the assembly	101.67894875257635
This timidity which might proceed from the astonishment of innocence as well as the shame of guilt conciliated some in his favor for men who are truly generous are always ready to compassionate when the misfortune of their enemy surpasses the limits of their hatred	160.62385819174955
The president put it to the vote and it was decided that the investigation should take place	67.20740005120699
The count was asked what time he required to prepare his defence	134.4519361169427
Morcerfs courage had revived when he found himself alive after this horrible blow	99.80506742019115
My lords answered he it is not by time I could repel the attack made on me by enemies unknown to me and doubtless hidden in obscurity it is immediately and by a thunderbolt that I must repel the flash of lightning which for a moment startled me	122.40880663162525
Oh that I could instead of taking up this defence shed my last drop of blood to prove to my noble colleagues that I am their equal in worth	155.36790926834345
These words made a favorable impression on behalf of the accused	84.51426400933076
I demand then that the examination shall take place as soon as possible and I will furnish the house with all necessary information	58.22641327174128
What day do you fix asked the president	33.27415693377676
Today I am at your service replied the count	10.465681096856848
Does the House approve that the examination should take place today	52.42962957314398
A committee of twelve members was chosen to examine the proofs brought forward by Morcerf	239.58324892900936
The investigation would begin at eight oclock that evening in the committeeroom and if postponement were necessary the proceedings would be resumed each evening at the same hour	118.6416004257983
Morcerf asked leave to retire he had to collect the documents he had long been preparing against this storm which his sagacity had foreseen	110.02207501501724
Beauchamp related to the young man all the facts we have just narrated his story however had over ours all the advantage of the animation of living things over the coldness of dead things	168.4349797305928
Albert listened trembling now with hope then with anger and then again with shame for from Beauchamps confidence he knew his father was guilty and he asked himself how since he was guilty he could prove his innocence	104.23167756163295
Beauchamp hesitated to continue his narrative	1869.8922598580461
What next My friend you impose a painful task on me	244.87651871078194
Absolutely and rather from your lips than anothers	652.0394085889435
Muster up all your courage then for never have you required it more	210.88410838535344
Albert passed his hand over his forehead as if to try his strength as a man who is preparing to defend his life proves his shield and bends his sword	62.865204475154165
He thought himself strong enough for he mistook fever for energy	1155.3612785109242
The evening arrived all Paris was in expectation	69.81358571223996
Many said your father had only to show himself to crush the charge against him many others said he would not appear while some asserted that they had seen him start for Brussels and others went to the policeoffice to inquire if he had taken out a passport	110.38441797644174
I used all my influence with one of the committee a young peer of my acquaintance to get admission to one of the galleries	123.31152648419567
He called for me at seven oclock and before anyone had arrived asked one of the doorkeepers to place me in a box	89.89195657300178
I was concealed by a column and might witness the whole of the terrible scene which was about to take place	43.51498674116802
At eight oclock all were in their places and M	50.94500402227439
de Morcerf entered at the last stroke	74.94471029728639
He held some papers in his hand his countenance was calm and his step firm and he was dressed with great care in his military uniform which was buttoned completely up to the chin	83.74778128836321
His presence produced a good effect	22.351843440505494
The committee was made up of Liberals several of whom came forward to shake hands with him	171.7469275120807
Albert felt his heart bursting at these particulars but gratitude mingled with his sorrow he would gladly have embraced those who had given his father this proof of esteem at a moment when his honor was so powerfully attacked	124.42406788563163
At this moment one of the doorkeepers brought in a letter for the president	90.27312081455791
You are at liberty to speak M	132.87135555837253
de Morcerf said the president as he unsealed the letter and the count began his defence I assure you Albert in a most eloquent and skilful manner	136.3176751274072
He produced documents proving that the Vizier of Yanina had up to the last moment honored him with his entire confidence since he had interested him with a negotiation of life and death with the emperor	67.41330640914629
He produced the ring his mark of authority with which Ali Pasha generally sealed his letters and which the latter had given him that he might on his return at any hour of the day or night gain access to the presence even in the harem	76.47566632551187
Unfortunately the negotiation failed and when he returned to defend his benefactor he was dead	42.23831807483142
But said the count so great was Ali Pashas confidence that on his deathbed he resigned his favorite mistress and her daughter to my care	134.8481378246555
Albert started on hearing these words the history of Hayde recurred to him and he remembered what she had said of that message and the ring and the manner in which she had been sold and made a slave	56.49029106646719
And what effect did this discourse produce anxiously inquired Albert	4081.1252152434413
I acknowledge it affected me and indeed all the committee also said Beauchamp	141.3335860268112
Meanwhile the president carelessly opened the letter which had been brought to him but the first lines aroused his attention he read them again and again and fixing his eyes on M	39.40039365804614
de Morcerf Count said he you have said that the Vizier of Yanina confided his wife and daughter to your careYes sir replied Morcerf but in that like all the rest misfortune pursued me	100.14692457438223
On my return Vasiliki and her daughter Hayde had disappeared	73.01452736027358
Did you know themMy intimacy with the pasha and his unlimited confidence had gained me an introduction to them and I had seen them above twenty times	94.54057593146422
Have you any idea what became of themYes sir I heard they had fallen victims to their sorrow and perhaps to their poverty	250.67394239770738
I was not rich my life was in constant danger I could not seek them to my great regret	101.79364413318204
Gentlemen said he you have heard the Comte de Morcerfs defence	90.38597274669489
Can you sir produce any witnesses to the truth of what you have assertedAlas no monsieur replied the count all those who surrounded the vizier or who knew me at his court are either dead or gone away I know not where	96.90557533687455
I believe that I alone of all my countrymen survived that dreadful war	534.1163136202567
I have only the letters of Ali Tepelini which I have placed before you the ring a token of his goodwill which is here and lastly the most convincing proof I can offer after an anonymous attack and that is the absence of any witness against my veracity and the purity of my military life	114.12247774236639
A murmur of approbation ran through the assembly and at this moment Albert had nothing more transpired your fathers cause had been gained	65.6382408523149
It only remained to put it to the vote when the president resumed Gentlemen and you monsieuryou will not be displeased I presume to listen to one who calls himself a very important witness and who has just presented himself	101.12109205609397
He is doubtless come to prove the perfect innocence of our colleague	204.05451424246192
Here is a letter I have just received on the subject shall it be read or shall it be passed over and shall we take no notice of this incident M	75.90781567370686
de Morcerf turned pale and clenched his hands on the papers he held	29.61746380968008
The committee decided to hear the letter the count was thoughtful and silent	46.870480976191935
PresidentI can furnish the committee of inquiry into the conduct of the LieutenantGeneral the Count of Morcerf in Epirus and in Macedonia with important particulars	139.70466000818288
The president paused and the count turned pale	14.97296701275076
The president looked at his auditors	10472.36828764967
Proceed was heard on all sides	4.173885234410107
I was on the spot at the death of Ali Pasha	22.661876818404465
I was present during his last moments	56.15787328503781
I know what is become of Vasiliki and Hayde	178.00086056485196
I am at the command of the committee and even claim the honor of being heard	44.21824134561295
I shall be in the lobby when this note is delivered to you	147.13500422218567
And who is this witness or rather this enemy asked the count in a tone in which there was a visible alteration	74.91141135112568
We shall know sir replied the president	12.73729906846557
Is the committee willing to hear this witnessYes yes they all said at once	276.1054484004218
Is there anyone in the lobby said the president	106.54294114743804
Who is itA woman accompanied by a servant	16.558989250237925
Bring her in said the president	56.60525458465313
Five minutes after the doorkeeper again appeared all eyes were fixed on the door and I said Beauchamp shared the general expectation and anxiety	113.89713280966491
Behind the doorkeeper walked a woman enveloped in a large veil which completely concealed her	108.68770307941355
It was evident from her figure and the perfumes she had about her that she was young and fastidious in her tastes but that was all	124.05497107483961
The president requested her to throw aside her veil and it was then seen that she was dressed in the Grecian costume and was remarkably beautiful	74.55273020810637
Ah said Albert it was she	152.82318755150644
You see I am calm and strong	34.081093585482215
And yet we must be drawing near the disclosure	380.9199178943664
de Morcerf continued Beauchamp looked at this woman with surprise and terror	41.88521994200523
Her lips were about to pass his sentence of life or death	106.58831845245619
To the committee the adventure was so extraordinary and curious that the interest they had felt for the counts safety became now quite a secondary matter	198.22671089112262
The president himself advanced to place a seat for the young lady but she declined availing herself of it	117.19864403132691
As for the count he had fallen on his chair it was evident that his legs refused to support him	41.54949034568843
Madame said the president you have engaged to furnish the committee with some important particulars respecting the affair at Yanina and you have stated that you were an eyewitness of the event	86.72659510162289
I was indeed said the stranger with a tone of sweet melancholy and with the sonorous voice peculiar to the East	37.06914415295164
But allow me to say that you must have been very young then	50.476466837011685
I was four years old but as those events deeply concerned me not a single detail has escaped my memory	225.83526034472698
In what manner could these events concern you and who are you that they should have made so deep an impression on youOn them depended my fathers life replied she	139.9215055392011
I am Hayde the daughter of Ali Tepelini pasha of Yanina and of Vasiliki his beloved wife	29.44504293141218
The blush of mingled pride and modesty which suddenly suffused the cheeks of the young woman the brilliancy of her eye and her highly important communication produced an indescribable effect on the assembly	149.4562431123217
As for the count he could not have been more overwhelmed if a thunderbolt had fallen at his feet and opened an immense gulf before him	74.7316165397194
Madame replied the president bowing with profound respect allow me to ask one question it shall be the last Can you prove the authenticity of what you have now stated	68.61559362149369
I can sir said Hayde drawing from under her veil a satin satchel highly perfumed for here is the register of my birth signed by my father and his principal officers and that of my baptism my father having consented to my being brought up in my mothers faiththis latter has been sealed by the grand primate of Macedonia and Epirus and lastly and perhaps the most important the record of the sale of my person and that of my mother to the Armenian merchant ElKobbir by the French officer who in his infamous bargain with the Porte had reserved as his part of the booty the wife and daughter of his benefactor whom he sold for the sum of four hundred thousand francs	111.51841691421394
A greenish pallor spread over the counts cheeks and his eyes became bloodshot at these terrible imputations which were listened to by the assembly with ominous silence	132.77024911906202
Hayde still calm but with a calmness more dreadful than the anger of another would have been handed to the president the record of her sale written in Arabic	126.04649238020286
It had been supposed some of the papers might be in the Arabian Romaic or Turkish language and the interpreter of the House was in attendance	145.56414404352225
One of the noble peers who was familiar with the Arabic language having studied it during the famous Egyptian campaign followed with his eye as the translator read aloud	178.5205813838138
I ElKobbir a slavemerchant and purveyor of the harem of his highness acknowledge having received for transmission to the sublime emperor from the French lord the Count of Monte Cristo an emerald valued at eight hundred thousand francs as the ransom of a young Christian slave of eleven years of age named Hayde the acknowledged daughter of the late lord Ali Tepelini pasha of Yanina and of Vasiliki his favorite she having been sold to me seven years previously with her mother who had died on arriving at Constantinople by a French colonel in the service of the Vizier Ali Tepelini named Fernand Mondego	82.47632035340028
The abovementioned purchase was made on his highnesss account whose mandate I had for the sum of four hundred thousand francs	61.89263371283922
Given at Constantinople by authority of his highness in the year 1247 of the Hegira	138.7057485087385
That this record should have all due authority it shall bear the imperial seal which the vendor is bound to have affixed to it	287.27001215403203
Near the merchants signature there was indeed the seal of the sublime emperor	76.71838117437869
A dreadful silence followed the reading of this document the count could only stare and his gaze fixed as if unconsciously on Hayde seemed one of fire and blood	153.91271567022653
Madame said the president may reference be made to the Count of Monte Cristo who is now I believe in Paris	31.84333883837336
Sir replied Hayde the Count of Monte Cristo my fosterfather has been in Normandy the last three days	34.1155795256014
Who then has counselled you to take this step one for which the court is deeply indebted to you and which is perfectly natural considering your birth and your misfortunesSir replied Hayde I have been led to take this step from a feeling of respect and grief	96.50583028558846
Although a Christian may God forgive me I have always sought to revenge my illustrious father	55.414471401189594
Since I set my foot in France and knew the traitor lived in Paris I have watched carefully	97.4262333217244
I live retired in the house of my noble protector but I do it from choice	68.22243303253099
I love retirement and silence because I can live with my thoughts and recollections of past days	94.56705168641672
But the Count of Monte Cristo surrounds me with every paternal care and I am ignorant of nothing which passes in the world	62.70329198601492
I learn all in the silence of my apartmentsfor instance I see all the newspapers every periodical as well as every new piece of music and by thus watching the course of the life of others I learned what had transpired this morning in the House of Peers and what was to take place this evening then I wrote	81.5230110229616
Then remarked the president the Count of Monte Cristo knows nothing of your present proceedingsHe is quite unaware of them and I have but one fear which is that he should disapprove of what I have done	73.23365972722667
But it is a glorious day for me continued the young girl raising her ardent gaze to heaven that on which I find at last an opportunity of avenging my father	60.884881889510446
The count had not uttered one word the whole of this time	35.690914060116626
His colleagues looked at him and doubtless pitied his prospects blighted under the perfumed breath of a woman	245.45850252290495
His misery was depicted in sinister lines on his countenance	179.88191034106146
de Morcerf said the president do you recognize this lady as the daughter of Ali Tepelini pasha of YaninaNo said Morcerf attempting to rise it is a base plot contrived by my enemies	118.4618469986112
Hayde whose eyes had been fixed on the door as if expecting someone turned hastily and seeing the count standing shrieked You do not know me said she	65.68268895072225
Well I fortunately recognize you You are Fernand Mondego the French officer who led the troops of my noble father It is you who surrendered the castle of Yanina It is you who sent by him to Constantinople to treat with the emperor for the life or death of your benefactor brought back a false mandate granting full pardon It is you who with that mandate obtained the pashas ring which gave you authority over Selim the firekeeper It is you who stabbed Selim	146.2719467699084
It is you who sold us my mother and me to the merchant ElKobbir Assassin assassin assassin you have still on your brow your masters blood Look gentlemen all	345.5256515444476
These words had been pronounced with such enthusiasm and evident truth that every eye was fixed on the counts forehead and he himself passed his hand across it as if he felt Alis blood still lingering there	106.72148038802882
de Morcerf as the officer Fernand MondegoIndeed I do cried Hayde	359.0734918522996
Oh my mother it was you who said You were free you had a beloved father you were destined to be almost a queen	105.4804644776758
Look well at that man it is he who raised your fathers head on the point of a spear it is he who sold us it is he who forsook us Look well at his right hand on which he has a large wound if you forgot his features you would know him by that hand into which fell one by one the gold pieces of the merchant ElKobbir I know him Ah let him say now if he does not recognize me Each word fell like a dagger on Morcerf and deprived him of a portion of his energy as she uttered the last he hid his mutilated hand hastily in his bosom and fell back on his seat overwhelmed by wretchedness and despair	85.82561647238141
This scene completely changed the opinion of the assembly respecting the accused count	232.21846333133698
Count of Morcerf said the president do not allow yourself to be cast down answer	77.92548845915908
The justice of the court is supreme and impartial as that of God it will not suffer you to be trampled on by your enemies without giving you an opportunity of defending yourself	108.79604062319407
Shall further inquiries be made Shall two members of the House be sent to Yanina Speak Morcerf did not reply	227.6041621726948
Then all the members looked at each other with terror	9.998197531121104
They knew the counts energetic and violent temper it must be indeed a dreadful blow which would deprive him of courage to defend himself	100.22442967647693
They expected that his stupefied silence would be followed by a fiery outburst	142.10990972472234
Well asked the president what is your decision	96.8617347354322
I have no reply to make said the count in a low tone	13.337459123649266
Has the daughter of Ali Tepelini spoken the truth said the president	39.36155480917302
Is she then the terrible witness to whose charge you dare not plead Not guilty Have you really committed the crimes of which you are accused The count looked around him with an expression which might have softened tigers but which could not disarm his judges	153.03841779092514
Then he raised his eyes towards the ceiling but withdrew then immediately as if he feared the roof would open and reveal to his distressed view that second tribunal called heaven and that other judge named God	254.23083676428544
Then with a hasty movement he tore open his coat which seemed to stifle him and flew from the room like a madman his footstep was heard one moment in the corridor then the rattling of his carriagewheels as he was driven rapidly away	73.84287070618282
Gentlemen said the president when silence was restored is the Count of Morcerf convicted of felony treason and conduct unbecoming a member of this HouseYes replied all the members of the committee of inquiry with a unanimous voice	231.07073780016728
Hayde had remained until the close of the meeting	74.32297266338267
She heard the counts sentence pronounced without betraying an expression of joy or pity then drawing her veil over her face she bowed majestically to the councillors and left with that dignified step which Virgil attributes to his goddesses	171.3057973287515
Then continued Beauchamp I took advantage of the silence and the darkness to leave the house without being seen	44.196856913415225
The usher who had introduced me was waiting for me at the door and he conducted me through the corridors to a private entrance opening into the Rue de Vaugirard	61.545951154492
I left with mingled feelings of sorrow and delight	45.462539992547086
Excuse me Albertsorrow on your account and delight with that noble girl thus pursuing paternal vengeance	346.0927348158801
Yes Albert from whatever source the blow may have proceededit may be from an enemy but that enemy is only the agent of Providence	127.38563770001326
Albert held his head between his hands he raised his face red with shame and bathed in tears and seizing Beauchamps arm	57.72579196396633
My friend said he my life is ended	80.95782089978967
I can not calmly say with you Providence has struck the blow but I must discover who pursues me with this hatred and when I have found him I shall kill him or he will kill me	52.977262556300886
I rely on your friendship to assist me Beauchamp if contempt has not banished it from your heart	162.672854823963
Contempt my friend How does this misfortune affect you No happily that unjust prejudice is forgotten which made the son responsible for the fathers actions	292.02854452841217
Review your life Albert although it is only just beginning did a lovely summers day ever dawn with greater purity than has marked the commencement of your career No Albert take my advice	313.4617685710191
You are young and richleave Parisall is soon forgotten in this great Babylon of excitement and changing tastes	483.95828324817643
You will return after three or four years with a Russian princess for a bride and no one will think more of what occurred yesterday than if it had happened sixteen years ago	76.96594267611248
Thank you my dear Beauchamp thank you for the excellent feeling which prompts your advice but it can not be	94.71538605019312
I have told you my wish or rather my determination	80.92963738690014
You understand that interested as I am in this affair I can not see it in the same light as you do	17.05610894346866
What appears to you to emanate from a celestial source seems to me to proceed from one far less pure	274.2339528822873
Providence appears to me to have no share in this affair and happily so for instead of the invisible impalpable agent of celestial rewards and punishments I shall find one both palpable and visible on whom I shall revenge myself I assure you for all I have suffered during the last month	139.73320655193447
Now I repeat Beauchamp I wish to return to human and material existence and if you are still the friend you profess to be help me to discover the hand that struck the blow	99.14621970053555
Be it so said Beauchamp if you must have me descend to earth I submit and if you will seek your enemy I will assist you and I will engage to find him my honor being almost as deeply interested as yours	87.11622524615747
Well then you understand Beauchamp that we begin our search immediately	267.91699747225687
Each moments delay is an eternity for me	134.37464347328347
The calumniator is not yet punished and he may hope that he will not be but on my honor if he thinks so he deceives himself	80.47617132222396
Ah Beauchamp I see you know something already you will restore me to life	54.30677773816122
I do not say there is any truth in what I am going to tell you but it is at least a ray of light in a dark night by following it we may perhaps discover something more certain	47.52621213775462
Well I will tell you what I did not like to mention on my return from Yanina	56.76939341990141
I went of course to the chief banker of the town to make inquiries	91.7943960604235
At the first word before I had even mentioned your fathers name	78.89670547894033
I guess what brings you here	272.93361878719776
Because a fortnight since I was questioned on the same subject	47.33419758559867
By a banker of Paris my correspondent	357.3277851844881
He cried Albert yes it is indeed he who has so long pursued my father with jealous hatred	73.54656134795508
He the man who would be popular can not forgive the Count of Morcerf for being created a peer and this marriage broken off without a reason being assignedyes it is all from the same cause	131.31540967809062
Make inquiries Albert but do not be angry without reason make inquiries and if it be true	88.31618438747431
Oh yes if it be true cried the young man he shall pay me all I have suffered	26.844462269656596
Beware Morcerf he is already an old man	31.853782342598837
I will respect his age as he has respected the honor of my family if my father had offended him why did he not attack him personally Oh no he was afraid to encounter him face to face	90.1681811493305
I do not condemn you Albert I only restrain you	290.1183088078405
Oh do not fear besides you will accompany me	15.113311264742903
Beauchamp solemn transactions should be sanctioned by a witness	179.30678812776466
Before this day closes if M	207.52816532295694
Danglars is guilty he shall cease to live or I shall die	27.76829992904944
Pardieu Beauchamp mine shall be a splendid funeral	255.44634321425227
When such resolutions are made Albert they should be promptly executed	505.7639539590185
Do you wish to go to M	18.13961517622546
On entering the bankers mansion they perceived the phaeton and servant of M	120.22761816893552
Ah parbleu that s good said Albert with a gloomy tone	21.687942209305472
Danglars will not fight with me I will kill his soninlaw Cavalcanti will certainly fight	101.99636878129562
The servant announced the young man but the banker recollecting what had transpired the day before did not wish him admitted	113.2241166542981
It was however too late Albert had followed the footman and hearing the order given forced the door open and followed by Beauchamp found himself in the bankers study	89.51287777178301
Sir cried the latter am I no longer at liberty to receive whom I choose in my house You appear to forget yourself sadly	90.98881594056132
No sir said Albert coldly there are circumstances in which one can not except through cowardiceI offer you that refugerefuse to admit certain persons at least	360.06067063448893
What is your errand then with me sir	32.13522887853423
I mean said Albert drawing near and without apparently noticing Cavalcanti who stood with his back towards the fireplaceI mean to propose a meeting in some retired corner where no one will interrupt us for ten minutes that will be sufficientwhere two men having met one of them will remain on the ground	125.32892693262413
Danglars turned pale Cavalcanti moved a step forward and Albert turned towards him	48.063521543223864
And you too said he come if you like monsieur you have a claim being almost one of the family and I will give as many rendezvous of that kind as I can find persons willing to accept them	88.3730783144376
Cavalcanti looked at Danglars with a stupefied air and the latter making an effort arose and stepped between the two young men	56.05265170569374
Alberts attack on Andrea had placed him on a different footing and he hoped this visit had another cause than that he had at first supposed	130.9892484588559
Indeed sir said he to Albert if you are come to quarrel with this gentleman because I have preferred him to you I shall resign the case to the kings attorney	58.51826584038594
You mistake sir said Morcerf with a gloomy smile I am not referring in the least to matrimony and I only addressed myself to M	56.01021113973763
Cavalcanti because he appeared disposed to interfere between us	351.746479678618
In one respect you are right for I am ready to quarrel with everyone today but you have the first claim M	87.33897756708777
Sir replied Danglars pale with anger and fear I warn you when I have the misfortune to meet with a mad dog I kill it and far from thinking myself guilty of a crime I believe I do society a kindness	59.44938546824718
Now if you are mad and try to bite me I will kill you without pity	52.23388978486413
Is it my fault that your father has dishonored himself	41.21673511830395
Yes miserable wretch cried Morcerf it is your fault	20.027844981501552
My fault said he you must be mad What do I know of the Grecian affair Have I travelled in that country Did I advise your father to sell the castle of Yaninato betray	147.5465998994044
Silence said Albert with a thundering voice	358.8363525938206
No it is not you who have directly made this exposure and brought this sorrow on us but you hypocritically provoked it	331.5971969912195
Yes you How came it known	777.3779889991611
I suppose you read it in the paper in the account from Yanina	80.38861604557903
Who wrote for particulars concerning my father	12.677058824510858
I imagine anyone may write to Yanina	80.48792079992774
It appears to me that when about to marry your daughter to a young man it is right to make some inquiries respecting his family it is not only a right but a duty	52.961012709878055
You wrote sir knowing what answer you would receive	91.22719014039401
I indeed I assure you cried Danglars with a confidence and security proceeding less from fear than from the interest he really felt for the young man I solemnly declare to you that I should never have thought of writing to Yanina did I know anything of Ali Pashas misfortunes	99.96776660420502
Who then urged you to write Tell me	305.4893378946724
Pardieu it was the most simple thing in the world	36.766666457022986
I was speaking of your fathers past history	552.8272223348434
I said the origin of his fortune remained obscure	701.3769758986123
The person to whom I addressed my scruples asked me where your father had acquired his property I answered In Greece	246.9934905780241
Then said he write to Yanina	985.324510125078
No other than your friend Monte Cristo	11.855545435660208
The Count of Monte Cristo told you to write to Yanina	69.255994035223
Yes and I wrote and will show you my correspondence if you like	97.09687234725442
Albert and Beauchamp looked at each other	6.2244526529210304
Sir said Beauchamp who had not yet spoken you appear to accuse the count who is absent from Paris at this moment and can not justify himself	44.53748223257798
I accuse no one sir said Danglars I relate and I will repeat before the count what I have said to you	40.29673316404872
Does the count know what answer you received	374.0748833853468
Yes I showed it to him	25.612911762079456
Did he know my fathers Christian name was Fernand and his family name Mondego	283.3781090672128
Yes I had told him that long since and I did only what any other would have done in my circumstances and perhaps less	78.21331831363938
When the day after the arrival of this answer your father came by the advice of Monte Cristo to ask my daughters hand for you I decidedly refused him but without any explanation or exposure	75.94180458751198
In short why should I have any more to do with the affair How did the honor or disgrace of M	46.78555519617699
de Morcerf affect me It neither increased nor decreased my income	1037.3749445723322
Albert felt the blood mounting to his brow there was no doubt upon the subject	18.28964549325235
Danglars defended himself with the baseness but at the same time with the assurance of a man who speaks the truth at least in part if not whollynot for conscience sake but through fear	105.54499694790327
Besides what was Morcerf seeking It was not whether Danglars or Monte Cristo was more or less guilty it was a man who would answer for the offence whether trifling or serious it was a man who would fight and it was evident Danglars would not fight	77.49373689878227
In addition to this everything forgotten or unperceived before presented itself now to his recollection	454.1733556326266
Monte Cristo knew everything as he had bought the daughter of Ali Pasha and knowing everything he had advised Danglars to write to Yanina	66.96146256584647
The answer known he had yielded to Alberts wish to be introduced to Hayde and allowed the conversation to turn on the death of Ali and had not opposed Haydes recital but having doubtless warned the young girl in the few Romaic words he spoke to her not to implicate Morcerfs father	155.19135517629425
Besides had he not begged of Morcerf not to mention his fathers name before Hayde Lastly he had taken Albert to Normandy when he knew the final blow was near	155.9797008231818
There could be no doubt that all had been calculated and previously arranged Monte Cristo then was in league with his fathers enemies	126.86004415462452
Albert took Beauchamp aside and communicated these ideas to him	303.2023446674261
You are right said the latter M	155.37005852550735
Danglars has only been a secondary agent in this sad affair and it is of M	93.83699145850315
de Monte Cristo that you must demand an explanation	96.07029526596808
Sir said he to Danglars understand that I do not take a final leave of you I must ascertain if your insinuations are just and am going now to inquire of the Count of Monte Cristo	59.33739598090131
He bowed to the banker and went out with Beauchamp without appearing to notice Cavalcanti	114.41859373035592
Danglars accompanied him to the door where he again assured Albert that no motive of personal hatred had influenced him against the Count of Morcerf	87.766790448228
At the bankers door Beauchamp stopped Morcerf	352.1999878376309
Listen said he just now I told you it was of M	26.664392953567727
de Monte Cristo you must demand an explanation	129.93452893891103
Yes and we are going to his house	21.616353360063062
Reflect Morcerf one moment before you go	54.47274325502378
On the importance of the step you are taking	213.20566051618275
Is it more serious than going to M	103.64830128122857
Danglars is a moneylover and those who love money you know think too much of what they risk to be easily induced to fight a duel	121.04260686994886
The other is on the contrary to all appearance a true nobleman but do you not fear to find him a bully	122.95744954798707
I only fear one thing namely to find a man who will not fight	40.03683975092786
Do not be alarmed said Beauchamp he will meet you	34.66577561742152
My only fear is that he will be too strong for you	30.483282740226933
My friend said Morcerf with a sweet smile that is what I wish	15.463835731615452
The happiest thing that could occur to me would be to die in my fathers stead that would save us all	62.51990220319489
Your mother would die of grief	8.846195066414621
My poor mother said Albert passing his hand across his eyes I know she would but better so than die of shame	62.50817495804405
But do you think we shall find the count at home	29.11065332083482
He intended returning some hours after me and doubtless he is now at home	51.02967364386582
They ordered the driver to take them to No	53.9796749247975
Beauchamp wished to go in alone but Albert observed that as this was an unusual circumstance he might be allowed to deviate from the usual etiquette of duels	180.67456639422772
The cause which the young man espoused was one so sacred that Beauchamp had only to comply with all his wishes he yielded and contented himself with following Morcerf	187.42442329505903
Albert sprang from the porters lodge to the steps	51.488845006868374
The count had indeed just arrived but he was in his bath and had forbidden that anyone should be admitted	76.43613471123994
But after his bath asked Morcerf	232.15933737002354
My master will go to dinner	985.1422293240856
He is going to the Opera	250.89485595874504
Are you sure of it asked Albert	53.33442794498042
Quite sir my master has ordered his horses at eight oclock precisely	79.54037405069413
Very good replied Albert that is all I wished to know	15.942879324715896
Then turning towards Beauchamp If you have anything to attend to Beauchamp do it directly if you have any appointment for this evening defer it till tomorrow	104.48777978752064
I depend on you to accompany me to the Opera and if you can bring ChteauRenaud with you	51.393079484640374
Beauchamp availed himself of Alberts permission and left him promising to call for him at a quarter before eight	85.86723916466835
On his return home Albert expressed his wish to Franz Debray and Morrel to see them at the Opera that evening	53.444703768768484
Then he went to see his mother who since the events of the day before had refused to see anyone and had kept her room	40.698636899011234
He found her in bed overwhelmed with grief at this public humiliation	256.0337629280327
The sight of Albert produced the effect which might naturally be expected on Mercds she pressed her sons hand and sobbed aloud but her tears relieved her	146.80884384430263
Albert stood one moment speechless by the side of his mothers bed	21.74032455199176
It was evident from his pale face and knit brows that his resolution to revenge himself was growing weaker	250.36790511896191
My dear mother said he do you know if M	22.42354499501824
Mercds started she noticed that the young man did not say my father	19.535697552094547
My son she said persons in the counts situation have many secret enemies	166.0040214711612
Those who are known are not the most dangerous	44.38048696385938
I know it and appeal to your penetration	178.92911194829588
You are of so superior a mind nothing escapes you	420.4965967791856
Because for instance you noticed on the evening of the ball we gave that M	108.09330881739054
de Monte Cristo would eat nothing in our house	31.939493539438907
Mercds raised herself on her feverish arm	281.7122242034094
de Monte Cristo she exclaimed and how is he connected with the question you asked me	84.7150779112434
de Monte Cristo is almost an Oriental and it is customary with the Orientals to secure full liberty for revenge by not eating or drinking in the houses of their enemies	204.25078431018633
de Monte Cristo is our enemy replied Mercds becoming paler than the sheet which covered her	66.78264038637712
Who told you so Why you are mad Albert M	72.90602032018384
de Monte Cristo has only shown us kindness	635.366410729604
de Monte Cristo saved your life you yourself presented him to us	61.89268453715575
Oh I entreat you my son if you had entertained such an idea dispel it and my counsel to younay my prayeris to retain his friendship	230.45930769737512
Mother replied the young man you have special reasons for telling me to conciliate that man	234.6122170880401
I said Mercds blushing as rapidly as she had turned pale and again becoming paler than ever	36.44300391785313
Yes doubtless and is it not that he may never do us any harm	57.60990338083777
Mercds shuddered and fixing on her son a scrutinizing gaze You speak strangely said she to Albert and you appear to have some singular prejudices	182.54380261598743
What has the count done Three days since you were with him in Normandy only three days since we looked on him as our best friend	97.30211343553363
An ironical smile passed over Alberts lips	45.32428097016964
Mercds saw it and with the double instinct of woman and mother guessed all but as she was prudent and strongminded she concealed both her sorrows and her fears	254.28259005155667
Albert was silent an instant after the countess resumed	146.78023293135203
You came to inquire after my health I will candidly acknowledge that I am not well	73.23571044355458
You should install yourself here and cheer my solitude	656.7711044357558
I do not wish to be left alone	40.53544954959102
Mother said the young man you know how gladly I would obey your wish but an urgent and important affair obliges me to leave you for the whole evening	146.73628052081725
Well replied Mercds sighing go Albert I will not make you a slave to your filial piety	93.01628796945172
Albert pretended he did not hear bowed to his mother and quitted her	77.5000572877795
Scarcely had he shut her door when Mercds called a confidential servant and ordered him to follow Albert wherever he should go that evening and to come and tell her immediately what he observed	134.86954610915149
Then she rang for her ladys maid and weak as she was she dressed in order to be ready for whatever might happen	107.8729177773453
The footmans mission was an easy one	145.09713320612497
Albert went to his room and dressed with unusual care	127.73965891174626
At ten minutes to eight Beauchamp arrived he had seen ChteauRenaud who had promised to be in the orchestra before the curtain was raised	59.07225921710909
Both got into Alberts coup and as the young man had no reason to conceal where he was going he called aloud To the Opera	40.93472438022318
In his impatience he arrived before the beginning of the performance	62.95110775457593
ChteauRenaud was at his post apprised by Beauchamp of the circumstances he required no explanation from Albert	176.54280550945464
The conduct of the son in seeking to avenge his father was so natural that ChteauRenaud did not seek to dissuade him and was content with renewing his assurances of devotion	130.94483494843197
Debray was not yet come but Albert knew that he seldom lost a scene at the Opera	83.87017677099907
Albert wandered about the theatre until the curtain was drawn up	42.34819267932657
He hoped to meet with M	91.40605449328498
de Monte Cristo either in the lobby or on the stairs	30.773331296731577
The bell summoned him to his seat and he entered the orchestra with ChteauRenaud and Beauchamp	48.05023437705673
But his eyes scarcely quitted the box between the columns which remained obstinately closed during the whole of the first act	92.18767857685168
At last as Albert was looking at his watch for about the hundredth time at the beginning of the second act the door opened and Monte Cristo entered dressed in black and leaning over the front of the box looked around the pit	40.16065529625889
Morrel followed him and looked also for his sister and brother inlaw he soon discovered them in another box and kissed his hand to them	157.55723848648438
The count in his survey of the pit encountered a pale face and threatening eyes which evidently sought to gain his attention	87.80388288921762
He recognized Albert but thought it better not to notice him as he looked so angry and discomposed	108.21078531661851
Without communicating his thoughts to his companion he sat down drew out his operaglass and looked another way	76.75312880653755
Although apparently not noticing Albert he did not however lose sight of him and when the curtain fell at the end of the second act he saw him leave the orchestra with his two friends	32.00099355781314
Then his head was seen passing at the back of the boxes and the count knew that the approaching storm was intended to fall on him	39.823252476741004
He was at the moment conversing cheerfully with Morrel but he was well prepared for what might happen	157.36505450812174
The door opened and Monte Cristo turning round saw Albert pale and trembling followed by Beauchamp and ChteauRenaud	55.2545524578005
Well cried he with that benevolent politeness which distinguished his salutation from the common civilities of the world my cavalier has attained his object	291.8103165496719
The countenance of this man who possessed such extraordinary control over his feelings expressed the most perfect cordiality	245.73476291508902
Morrel only then recollected the letter he had received from the viscount in which without assigning any reason he begged him to go to the Opera but he understood that something terrible was brooding	95.99588066589877
We are not come here sir to exchange hypocritical expressions of politeness or false professions of friendship said Albert but to demand an explanation	341.044910753452
The young mans trembling voice was scarcely audible	229.21576669283482
An explanation at the Opera said the count with that calm tone and penetrating eye which characterize the man who knows his cause is good	50.832007985687994
Little acquainted as I am with the habits of Parisians I should not have thought this the place for such a demand	79.11578494041646
Still if people will shut themselves up said Albert and can not be seen because they are bathing dining or asleep we must avail ourselves of the opportunity whenever they are to be seen	120.15119345058663
I am not difficult of access sir for yesterday if my memory does not deceive me you were at my house	66.39182364812255
Yesterday I was at your house sir said the young man because then I knew not who you were	36.09833820137932
In pronouncing these words Albert had raised his voice so as to be heard by those in the adjoining boxes and in the lobby	52.259432340919155
Thus the attention of many was attracted by this altercation	387.08554892350503
Where are you come from sir   said Monte Cristo You do not appear to be in the possession of your senses	25.570026775881697
Provided I understand your perfidy sir and succeed in making you understand that I will be revenged I shall be reasonable enough said Albert furiously	105.85666565582993
I do not understand you sir replied Monte Cristo and if I did your tone is too high	76.10402514541764
I am at home here and I alone have a right to raise my voice above anothers	159.2365132905898
Monte Cristo pointed towards the door with the most commanding dignity	72.17688549950108
Ah I shall know how to make you leave your home replied Albert clasping in his convulsed grasp the glove which Monte Cristo did not lose sight of	56.873215325583416
Well well said Monte Cristo quietly I see you wish to quarrel with me but I would give you one piece of advice which you will do well to keep in mind	50.57907761477258
It is in poor taste to make a display of a challenge	63.544114543456956
Display is not becoming to everyone M	435.3527474747934
At this name a murmur of astonishment passed around the group of spectators of this scene	82.66193550885765
They had talked of no one but Morcerf the whole day	70.90610468442527
Albert understood the allusion in a moment and was about to throw his glove at the count when Morrel seized his hand while Beauchamp and ChteauRenaud fearing the scene would surpass the limits of a challenge held him back	64.09465048932108
But Monte Cristo without rising and leaning forward in his chair merely stretched out his arm and taking the damp crushed glove from the clenched hand of the young man	48.00001276182332
Sir said he in a solemn tone I consider your glove thrown and will return it to you wrapped around a bullet	240.41374577517792
Now leave me or I will summon my servants to throw you out at the door	41.949769227894166
Wild almost unconscious and with eyes inflamed Albert stepped back and Morrel closed the door	84.40459470575156
Monte Cristo took up his glass again as if nothing had happened his face was like marble and his heart was like bronze	59.49685849633002
Morrel whispered What have you done to him	36.278999765148406
I Nothingat least personally said Monte Cristo	2.7113190699056657
But there must be some cause for this strange scene	73.818429261204
The Count of Morcerfs adventure exasperates the young man	124.97695944126176
Have you anything to do with it	14.419795212718764
It was through Hayde that the Chamber was informed of his fathers treason	92.24170808008206
I had been told but would not credit it that the Grecian slave I have seen with you here in this very box was the daughter of Ali Pasha	63.033166927144336
Then said Morrel I understand it all and this scene was premeditated	120.24264365552186
Albert wrote to request me to come to the Opera doubtless that I might be a witness to the insult he meant to offer you	60.84325566922527
Probably said Monte Cristo with his imperturbable tranquillity	133.53070020623758
But what shall you do with him	14.655740417690213
What shall I do with Albert As certainly Maximilian as I now press your hand I shall kill him before ten oclock tomorrow morning	74.09181786835934
Morrel in his turn took Monte Cristos hand in both of his and he shuddered to feel how cold and steady it was	60.71822711171806
Ah count said he his father loves him so much	47.6583727249445
Do not speak to me of that said Monte Cristo with the first movement of anger he had betrayed I will make him suffer	43.7158882087919
Morrel amazed let fall Monte Cristos hand	16.312631321531583
Dear Maximilian interrupted the count listen how adorably Duprez is singing that line	2201.2953796865745
O Mathilde idole de mon me	89.894539453237
I was the first to discover Duprez at Naples and the first to applaud him	178.1557167233842
Morrel saw it was useless to say more and refrained	179.76326347880217
The curtain which had risen at the close of the scene with Albert again fell and a rap was heard at the door	60.83734767665957
Come in said Monte Cristo with a voice that betrayed not the least emotion and immediately Beauchamp appeared	100.0486441502237
Beauchamp said Monte Cristo as if this was the first time he had seen the journalist that evening be seated	60.379356979031684
Beauchamp bowed and sitting down Sir said he I just now accompanied M	235.12636824716145
And that means replied Monte Cristo laughing that you had probably just dined together	150.92145312781366
I am happy to see M	40.68690886272753
Beauchamp that you are more sober than he was	65.37421477804499
Beauchamp Albert was wrong I acknowledge to betray so much anger and I come on my own account to apologize for him	73.15700019497187
And having done so entirely on my own account be it understood I would add that I believe you too gentlemanly to refuse giving him some explanation concerning your connection with Yanina	105.17971395544787
Then I will add two words about the young Greek girl	31.389050892682395
Monte Cristo motioned him to be silent	69.14460076463733
Come said he laughing there are all my hopes about to be destroyed	54.12745515784563
Doubtless you wish to make me appear a very eccentric character	139.12024294896383
I am in your opinion a Lara a Manfred a Lord Ruthven then just as I am arriving at the climax you defeat your own end and seek to make an ordinary man of me	172.5815201257657
You bring me down to your own level and demand explanations Indeed M	572.9545107394326
Yet replied Beauchamp haughtily there are occasions when probity commands	1159.9284771529742
Beauchamp interposed this strange man the Count of Monte Cristo bows to none but the Count of Monte Cristo himself	28.586982361189026
Say no more I entreat you	3.102063950264466
I do what I please M	140.9404632751592
Beauchamp and it is always well done	162.4720258595909
Sir replied the young man honest men are not to be paid with such coin	124.99708174231813
I am sir a living guaranty replied Monte Cristo motionless but with a threatening look we have both blood in our veins which we wish to shedthat is our mutual guaranty	152.47706658787243
Tell the viscount so and that tomorrow before ten oclock I shall see what color his is	88.87156992532583
Then I have only to make arrangements for the duel said Beauchamp	109.69794787855604
It is quite immaterial to me said Monte Cristo and it was very unnecessary to disturb me at the Opera for such a trifle	30.039445715509814
In France people fight with the sword or pistol in the colonies with the carbine in Arabia with the dagger	109.70284140650118
Tell your client that although I am the insulted party in order to carry out my eccentricity I leave him the choice of arms and will accept without discussion without dispute anything even combat by drawing lots which is always stupid but with me different from other people as I am sure to gain	183.83201039440968
Sure to gain repeated Beauchamp looking with amazement at the count	37.39706790619546
Certainly said Monte Cristo slightly shrugging his shoulders otherwise I would not fight with M	72.6034171480654
I shall kill himI can not help it	12.86508918918585
Only by a single line this evening at my house let me know the arms and the hour I do not like to be kept waiting	76.04882992362374
Pistols then at eight oclock in the Bois de Vincennes said Beauchamp quite disconcerted not knowing if he was dealing with an arrogant braggadocio or a supernatural being	168.25170995588476
Very well sir said Monte Cristo	1.000185012817091
Now all that is settled do let me see the performance and tell your friend Albert not to come any more this evening he will hurt himself with all his illchosen barbarisms let him go home and go to sleep	112.3731834054113
Beauchamp left the box perfectly amazed	26406.916028060772
Now said Monte Cristo turning towards Morrel I may depend upon you may I not	39.68046753787688
Certainly said Morrel I am at your service count still	93.41895409310939
It is desirable I should know the real cause	85.70761021108046
That is to say you would rather not	73.00307726269789
The young man himself is acting blindfolded and knows not the true cause which is known only to God and to me but I give you my word Morrel that God who does know it will be on our side	71.25775692368293
Enough said Morrel who is your second witness	646.2974920934345
I know no one in Paris Morrel on whom I could confer that honor besides you and your brother Emmanuel	105.12388228560029
Do you think Emmanuel would oblige me	75.54433685738246
I will answer for him count	264.4010197251193
Well that is all I require	581.8628571673559
Tomorrow morning at seven oclock you will be with me will you not	18.479395874979758
Listen I never lose a note of this opera if I can avoid it the music of William Tell is so sweet	172.5043839282031
Monte Cristo waited according to his usual custom until Duprez had sung his famous Suivezmoi then he rose and went out	214.14869145283646
Morrel took leave of him at the door renewing his promise to be with him the next morning at seven oclock and to bring Emmanuel	67.63827444507936
Then he stepped into his coup calm and smiling and was at home in five minutes	45.74476748046324
No one who knew the count could mistake his expression when on entering he said	125.61737201823293
Ali bring me my pistols with the ivory cross	128.7058899634074
Ali brought the box to his master who examined the weapons with a solicitude very natural to a man who is about to intrust his life to a little powder and shot	83.23647798201503
These were pistols of an especial pattern which Monte Cristo had had made for target practice in his own room	137.1261410546057
A cap was sufficient to drive out the bullet and from the adjoining room no one would have suspected that the count was as sportsmen would say keeping his hand in	89.9754359175398
He was just taking one up and looking for the point to aim at on a little iron plate which served him as a target when his study door opened and Baptistin entered	84.57539556485263
Before he had spoken a word the count saw in the next room a veiled woman who had followed closely after Baptistin and now seeing the count with a pistol in his hand and swords on the table rushed in	63.73172770729575
Baptistin looked at his master who made a sign to him and he went out closing the door after him	15.337376614334122
Who are you madame said the count to the veiled woman	75.41651700235008
The stranger cast one look around her to be certain that they were quite alone then bending as if she would have knelt and joining her hands she said with an accent of despair	56.236365938760784
Edmond you will not kill my son	60.003708362164815
The count retreated a step uttered a slight exclamation and let fall the pistol he held	78.28634832612781
What name did you pronounce then Madame de Morcerf said he	28.648213637742348
Yours cried she throwing back her veilyours which I alone perhaps have not forgotten	132.75189498569392
Edmond it is not Madame de Morcerf who is come to you it is Mercds	30.257874833938402
Mercds is dead madame said Monte Cristo I know no one now of that name	20.424428360994234
Mercds lives sir and she remembers for she alone recognized you when she saw you and even before she saw you by your voice Edmondby the simple sound of your voice and from that moment she has followed your steps watched you feared you and she needs not to inquire what hand has dealt the blow which now strikes M	155.04939774723738
Fernand do you mean replied Monte Cristo with bitter irony since we are recalling names let us remember them all	137.54501509995748
Monte Cristo had pronounced the name of Fernand with such an expression of hatred that Mercds felt a thrill of horror run through every vein	100.08543874580052
You see Edmond I am not mistaken and have cause to say Spare my son	108.58413347322646
And who told you madame that I have any hostile intentions against your son	108.05448730217468
No one in truth but a mother has twofold sight	308.7791495827441
I guessed all I followed him this evening to the Opera and concealed in a parquet box have seen all	119.17317453398398
If you have seen all madame you know that the son of Fernand has publicly insulted me said Monte Cristo with awful calmness	62.43413073337531
You have seen that he would have thrown his glove in my face if Morrel one of my friends had not stopped him	61.557970575955096
Listen to me my son has also guessed who you arehe attributes his fathers misfortunes to you	588.429125048535
Madame you are mistaken they are not misfortunesit is a punishment	120.9529482963875
It is not I who strike M	1535.694667224937
de Morcerf it is Providence which punishes him	539.351945836084
And why do you represent Providence cried Mercds	429.26325112750845
Why do you remember when it forgets What are Yanina and its vizier to you Edmond What injury has Fernand Mondego done you in betraying Ali Tepelini	445.67852116793983
Ah madame replied Monte Cristo all this is an affair between the French captain and the daughter of Vasiliki	49.68261405570635
It does not concern me you are right and if I have sworn to revenge myself it is not on the French captain or the Count of Morcerf but on the fisherman Fernand the husband of Mercds the Catalane	48.05951641203873
Ah sir cried the countess how terrible a vengeance for a fault which fatality made me commitfor I am the only culprit Edmond and if you owe revenge to anyone it is to me who had not fortitude to bear your absence and my solitude	133.50092925021167
But exclaimed Monte Cristo why was I absent And why were you alone	137.57750372996787
Because you had been arrested Edmond and were a prisoner	260.59443182143264
And why was I arrested Why was I a prisoner	166.10332032454005
I do not know said Mercds	369.4299266307517
You do not madame at least I hope not	18.989159799066364
I was arrested and became a prisoner because under the arbor of La Rserve the day before I was to marry you a man named Danglars wrote this letter which the fisherman Fernand himself posted	66.96842160937459
Monte Cristo went to a secretaire opened a drawer by a spring from which he took a paper which had lost its original color and the ink of which had become of a rusty huethis he placed in the hands of Mercds	62.68176063276635
It was Danglars letter to the kings attorney which the Count of Monte Cristo disguised as a clerk from the house of Thomson   French had taken from the file against Edmond Dants on the day he had paid the two hundred thousand francs to M	19.688017282070184
Mercds read with terror the following lines	375.07613432400336
The kings attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and religion that one Edmond Dants second in command on board the Pharaon this day arrived from Smyrna after having touched at Naples and PortoFerrajo is the bearer of a letter from Murat to the usurper and of another letter from the usurper to the Bonapartist club in Paris	55.91851111417665
Ample corroboration of this statement may be obtained by arresting the abovementioned Edmond Dants who either carries the letter for Paris about with him or has it at his fathers abode	112.32851245265631
Should it not be found in possession of either father or son then it will assuredly be discovered in the cabin belonging to the said Dants on board the Pharaon	69.68237841935725
How dreadful said Mercds passing her hand across her brow moist with perspiration and that letter	34.635224796238504
I bought it for two hundred thousand francs madame said Monte Cristo but that is a trifle since it enables me to justify myself to you	28.08405859612523
And the result of that letter	120.62993495881338
You well know madame was my arrest but you do not know how long that arrest lasted	71.10052982295883
You do not know that I remained for fourteen years within a quarter of a league of you in a dungeon in the Chteau dIf	42.304222676401345
You do not know that every day of those fourteen years I renewed the vow of vengeance which I had made the first day and yet I was not aware that you had married Fernand my calumniator and that my father had died of hunger	70.40848013556739
Can it be cried Mercds shuddering	1406.2797241879846
That is what I heard on leaving my prison fourteen years after I had entered it and that is why on account of the living Mercds and my deceased father I have sworn to revenge myself on Fernand andI have revenged myself	97.18491957589904
And you are sure the unhappy Fernand did that	225.4729900341285
I am satisfied madame that he did what I have told you besides that is not much more odious than that a Frenchman by adoption should pass over to the English that a Spaniard by birth should have fought against the Spaniards that a stipendiary of Ali should have betrayed and murdered Ali	139.52416772789013
Compared with such things what is the letter you have just reada lovers deception which the woman who has married that man ought certainly to forgive but not so the lover who was to have married her	133.69002924590168
Well the French did not avenge themselves on the traitor the Spaniards did not shoot the traitor Ali in his tomb left the traitor unpunished but I betrayed sacrificed buried have risen from my tomb by the grace of God to punish that man	216.05481522860288
He sends me for that purpose and here I am	61.99667622334972
The poor womans head and arms fell her legs bent under her and she fell on her knees	27.728241625390474
Forgive Edmond forgive for my sake who love you still	71.20570073379095
The dignity of the wife checked the fervor of the lover and the mother	104.178840715872
Her forehead almost touched the carpet when the count sprang forward and raised her	109.80786872414029
Then seated on a chair she looked at the manly countenance of Monte Cristo on which grief and hatred still impressed a threatening expression	89.84157317245672
Not crush that accursed race murmured he abandon my purpose at the moment of its accomplishment Impossible madame impossible	295.84033690286816
Edmond said the poor mother who tried every means when I call you Edmond why do you not call me Mercds	52.93737295321833
Mercds repeated Monte Cristo Mercds Well yes you are right that name has still its charms and this is the first time for a long period that I have pronounced it so distinctly	57.60831771464251
Oh Mercds I have uttered your name with the sigh of melancholy with the groan of sorrow with the last effort of despair I have uttered it when frozen with cold crouched on the straw in my dungeon I have uttered it consumed with heat rolling on the stone floor of my prison	81.70483597276845
Mercds I must revenge myself for I suffered fourteen yearsfourteen years I wept I cursed now I tell you Mercds I must revenge myself	280.2539079723567
The count fearing to yield to the entreaties of her he had so ardently loved called his sufferings to the assistance of his hatred	85.31240379579327
Revenge yourself then Edmond cried the poor mother but let your vengeance fall on the culpritson him on me but not on my son	115.40796522824766
It is written in the good book said Monte Cristo that the sins of the fathers shall fall upon their children to the third and fourth generation	89.26873555556708
Since God himself dictated those words to his prophet why should I seek to make myself better than God	91.72258747466827
Edmond continued Mercds with her arms extended towards the count since I first knew you I have adored your name have respected your memory	94.07889497265663
Edmond my friend do not compel me to tarnish that noble and pure image reflected incessantly on the mirror of my heart	324.5243281937754
Edmond if you knew all the prayers I have addressed to God for you while I thought you were living and since I have thought you must be dead Yes dead alas I imagined your dead body buried at the foot of some gloomy tower or cast to the bottom of a pit by hateful jailers and I wept What could I do for you Edmond besides pray and weep Listen for ten years I dreamed each night the same dream	124.37723227993281
I had been told that you had endeavored to escape that you had taken the place of another prisoner that you had slipped into the winding sheet of a dead body that you had been thrown alive from the top of the Chteau dIf and that the cry you uttered as you dashed upon the rocks first revealed to your jailers that they were your murderers	75.66208643673356
Well Edmond I swear to you by the head of that son for whom I entreat your pityEdmond for ten years I saw every night every detail of that frightful tragedy and for ten years I heard every night the cry which awoke me shuddering and cold	66.48886142887345
And I too Edmondoh believe meguilty as I wasoh yes I too have suffered much	588.5969317100266
Have you known what it is to have your father starve to death in your absence cried Monte Cristo thrusting his hands into his hair have you seen the woman you loved giving her hand to your rival while you were perishing at the bottom of a dungeon	66.83348403026383
No interrupted Mercds but I have seen him whom I loved on the point of murdering my son	35.469840805573014
Mercds uttered these words with such deep anguish with an accent of such intense despair that Monte Cristo could not restrain a sob	36.72173722722272
The lion was daunted the avenger was conquered	973.8195147124369
What do you ask of me said heyour sons life Well he shall live	273.86792659433377
Mercds uttered a cry which made the tears start from Monte Cristos eyes but these tears disappeared almost instantaneously for doubtless God had sent some angel to collect themfar more precious were they in his eyes than the richest pearls of Guzerat and Ophir	179.734193702282
Oh said she seizing the counts hand and raising it to her lips oh thank you thank you Edmond Now you are exactly what I dreamt you werethe man I always loved	93.87041596621951
Oh now I may say so	56.464776538944754
So much the better replied Monte Cristo as that poor Edmond will not have long to be loved by you	31.602720981886094
Death is about to return to the tomb the phantom to retire in darkness	127.37570176388778
I say since you command me Mercds I must die	40.60856348598532
Die and why so Who talks of dying Whence have you these ideas of death	257.3444705453666
You do not suppose that publicly outraged in the face of a whole theatre in the presence of your friends and those of your sonchallenged by a boy who will glory in my forgiveness as if it were a victoryyou do not suppose that I can for one moment wish to live	90.34898269945342
What I most loved after you Mercds was myself my dignity and that strength which rendered me superior to other men that strength was my life	236.7106549617228
With one word you have crushed it and I die	131.8191568921216
But the duel will not take place Edmond since you forgive	104.74456821495673
It will take place said Monte Cristo in a most solemn tone but instead of your sons blood to stain the ground mine will flow	93.78689852244078
Mercds shrieked and sprang towards Monte Cristo but suddenly stopping Edmond said she there is a God above us since you live and since I have seen you again I trust to him from my heart	61.533052320739124
While waiting his assistance I trust to your word you have said that my son should live have you not	39.828695206100576
Yes madame he shall live said Monte Cristo surprised that without more emotion Mercds had accepted the heroic sacrifice he made for her	157.0467134783992
Mercds extended her hand to the count	3.1109000006796874
Edmond said she and her eyes were wet with tears while looking at him to whom she spoke how noble it is of you how great the action you have just performed how sublime to have taken pity on a poor woman who appealed to you with every chance against her Alas I am grown old with grief more than with years and can not now remind my Edmond by a smile or by a look of that Mercds whom he once spent so many hours in contemplating	106.03032998382743
Ah believe me Edmond as I told you I too have suffered much I repeat it is melancholy to pass ones life without having one joy to recall without preserving a single hope but that proves that all is not yet over	106.2533337431701
No it is not finished I feel it by what remains in my heart	53.53150359075927
Oh I repeat it Edmond what you have just done is beautifulit is grand it is sublime	101.26686827166849
Do you say so now Mercdsthen what would you say if you knew the extent of the sacrifice I make to you Suppose that the Supreme Being after having created the world and fertilized chaos had paused in the work to spare an angel the tears that might one day flow for mortal sins from her immortal eyes suppose that when everything was in readiness and the moment had come for God to look upon his work and see that it was goodsuppose he had snuffed out the sun and tossed the world back into eternal nighttheneven then Mercds you could not imagine what I lose in sacrificing my life at this moment	185.18321334531979
Mercds looked at the count in a way which expressed at the same time her astonishment her admiration and her gratitude	72.12912008488063
Monte Cristo pressed his forehead on his burning hands as if his brain could no longer bear alone the weight of its thoughts	34.2860308551404
Edmond said Mercds I have but one word more to say to you	38.246116663330966
Edmond continued she you will see that if my face is pale if my eyes are dull if my beauty is gone if Mercds in short no longer resembles her former self in her features you will see that her heart is still the same	93.40092376285163
Adieu then Edmond I have nothing more to ask of heavenI have seen you again and have found you as noble and as great as formerly you were	94.30459051646703
Adieu Edmond adieu and thank you	2.7764516168324427
But the count did not answer	22.220294346398695
Mercds opened the door of the study and had disappeared before he had recovered from the painful and profound reverie into which his thwarted vengeance had plunged him	108.70526247148783
The clock of the Invalides struck one when the carriage which conveyed Madame de Morcerf rolled away on the pavement of the Champslyses and made Monte Cristo raise his head	44.734418290175086
What a fool I was said he not to tear my heart out on the day when I resolved to avenge myself	42.36244379871435
After Mercds had left Monte Cristo he fell into profound gloom	93.90464742381198
Around him and within him the flight of thought seemed to have stopped his energetic mind slumbered as the body does after extreme fatigue	359.90459269408234
What said he to himself while the lamp and the wax lights were nearly burnt out and the servants were waiting impatiently in the anteroom what this edifice which I have been so long preparing which I have reared with so much care and toil is to be crushed by a single touch a word a breath Yes this self of whom I thought so much of whom I was so proud who had appeared so worthless in the dungeons of the Chteau dIf and whom I had succeeded in making so great will be but a lump of clay tomorrow	91.24132604217542
Alas it is not the death of the body I regret for is not the destruction of the vital principle the repose to which everything is tending to which every unhappy being aspiresis not this the repose of matter after which I so long sighed and which I was seeking to attain by the painful process of starvation when Faria appeared in my dungeon What is death for me One step farther into resttwo perhaps into silence	225.68803688475597
No it is not existence then that I regret but the ruin of projects so slowly carried out so laboriously framed	258.4969602152877
Providence is now opposed to them when I most thought it would be propitious	134.2912821883766
It is not Gods will that they should be accomplished	80.18814161116549
This burden almost as heavy as a world which I had raised and I had thought to bear to the end was too great for my strength and I was compelled to lay it down in the middle of my career	45.2238706553455
Oh shall I then again become a fatalist whom fourteen years of despair and ten of hope had rendered a believer in Providence	356.81552163897913
And all thisall this because my heart which I thought dead was only sleeping because it has awakened and has begun to beat again because I have yielded to the pain of the emotion excited in my breast by a womans voice	114.77865501631311
Yet continued the count becoming each moment more absorbed in the anticipation of the dreadful sacrifice for the morrow which Mercds had accepted yet it is impossible that so nobleminded a woman should thus through selfishness consent to my death when I am in the prime of life and strength it is impossible that she can carry to such a point maternal love or rather delirium	120.61588392629189
There are virtues which become crimes by exaggeration	775.9691900544509
No she must have conceived some pathetic scene she will come and throw herself between us and what would be sublime here will there appear ridiculous	180.1602548168063
The blush of pride mounted to the counts forehead as this thought passed through his mind	75.63620462797863
Ridiculous repeated he and the ridicule will fall on me	136.54271772352055
I ridiculous No I would rather die	49.93469525404817
By thus exaggerating to his own mind the anticipated illfortune of the next day to which he had condemned himself by promising Mercds to spare her son the count at last exclaimed	105.87711966070722
Folly folly follyto carry generosity so far as to put myself up as a mark for that young man to aim at	44.466227761781205
He will never believe that my death was suicide and yet it is important for the honor of my memoryand this surely is not vanity but a justifiable prideit is important the world should know that I have consented by my free will to stop my arm already raised to strike and that with the arm which has been so powerful against others I have struck myself	105.97856176714949
It must be it shall be	1.6038406227309434
Seizing a pen he drew a paper from a secret drawer in his desk and wrote at the bottom of the document which was no other than his will made since his arrival in Paris a sort of codicil clearly explaining the nature of his death	68.53056998724696
I do this Oh my God said he with his eyes raised to heaven as much for thy honor as for mine	56.32017233308861
I have during ten years considered myself the agent of thy vengeance and other wretches like Morcerf Danglars Villefort even Morcerf himself must not imagine that chance has freed them from their enemy	349.32543033769764
Let them know on the contrary that their punishment which had been decreed by Providence is only delayed by my present determination and although they escape it in this world it awaits them in another and that they are only exchanging time for eternity	142.16426274195564
While he was thus agitated by gloomy uncertaintieswretched waking dreams of griefthe first rays of morning pierced his windows and shone upon the pale blue paper on which he had just inscribed his justification of Providence	213.38771621304778
It was just five oclock in the morning when a slight noise like a stifled sigh reached his ear	35.4247819116278
He turned his head looked around him and saw no one but the sound was repeated distinctly enough to convince him of its reality	52.47097612695543
He arose and quietly opening the door of the drawingroom saw Hayde who had fallen on a chair with her arms hanging down and her beautiful head thrown back	36.61499358516322
She had been standing at the door to prevent his going out without seeing her until sleep which the young can not resist had overpowered her frame wearied as she was with watching	135.72097736141868
The noise of the door did not awaken her and Monte Cristo gazed at her with affectionate regret	82.28452841867977
She remembered that she had a son said he and I forgot I had a daughter	52.50071492278054
Then shaking his head sorrowfully Poor Hayde said he she wished to see me to speak to me she has feared or guessed something	108.70551786448027
Oh I can not go without taking leave of her I can not die without confiding her to someone	100.22135189278137
He quietly regained his seat and wrote under the other lines	94.50832585226225
I bequeath to Maximilian Morrel captain of Spahisand son of my former patron Pierre Morrel shipowner at Marseillesthe sum of twenty millions a part of which may be offered to his sister Julie and brotherinlaw Emmanuel if he does not fear this increase of fortune may mar their happiness	201.96739115567482
These twenty millions are concealed in my grotto at Monte Cristo of which Bertuccio knows the secret	80.95940926524848
If his heart is free and he will marry Hayde the daughter of Ali Pasha of Yanina whom I have brought up with the love of a father and who has shown the love and tenderness of a daughter for me he will thus accomplish my last wish	49.518170208159916
This will has already constituted Hayde heiress of the rest of my fortune consisting of lands funds in England Austria and Holland furniture in my different palaces and houses and which without the twenty millions and the legacies to my servants may still amount to sixty millions	257.211857421054
He was finishing the last line when a cry behind him made him start and the pen fell from his hand	50.790448568148406
Hayde said he did you read it	55.98397124845976
Oh my lord said she why are you writing thus at such an hour Why are you bequeathing all your fortune to me Are you going to leave me	52.626183001147
I am going on a journey dear child said Monte Cristo with an expression of infinite tenderness and melancholy and if any misfortune should happen to me	26.18815740697504
Well asked the young girl with an authoritative tone the count had never observed before and which startled him	134.72434976397795
Well if any misfortune happen to me replied Monte Cristo I wish my daughter to be happy	19.59788215413118
Hayde smiled sorrowfully and shook her head	8.0110477585211
Do you think of dying my lord said she	58.750842164284414
The wise man my child has said It is good to think of death	31.022408369748764
Well if you die said she bequeath your fortune to others for if you die I shall require nothing and taking the paper she tore it in four pieces and threw it into the middle of the room	46.20491318466777
Then the effort having exhausted her strength she fell not asleep this time but fainting on the floor	99.62171610192178
The count leaned over her and raised her in his arms and seeing that sweet pale face those lovely eyes closed that beautiful form motionless and to all appearance lifeless the idea occurred to him for the first time that perhaps she loved him otherwise than as a daughter loves a father	94.50713762776851
Alas murmured he with intense suffering I might then have been happy yet	118.15658234144456
Then he carried Hayde to her room resigned her to the care of her attendants and returning to his study which he shut quickly this time he again copied the destroyed will	106.37226430899398
As he was finishing the sound of a cabriolet entering the yard was heard	72.6043801195659
Monte Cristo approached the window and saw Maximilian and Emmanuel alight	142.26028466688766
Good said he it was timeand he sealed his will with three seals	1040.6948313054459
A moment afterwards he heard a noise in the drawingroom and went to open the door himself	31.76632720360343
Morrel was there he had come twenty minutes before the time appointed	170.13378230969252
I am perhaps come too soon count said he but I frankly acknowledge that I have not closed my eyes all night nor has anyone in my house	64.03230975043672
I need to see you strong in your courageous assurance to recover myself	593.5337234312553
Monte Cristo could not resist this proof of affection he not only extended his hand to the young man but flew to him with open arms	39.3689910725435
Morrel said he it is a happy day for me to feel that I am beloved by such a man as you	36.37642234196993
Goodmorning Emmanuel you will come with me then Maximilian	36.10603924050041
Did you doubt it said the young captain	52.40742455019759
I watched you during the whole scene of that challenge yesterday I have been thinking of your firmness all night and I said to myself that justice must be on your side or mans countenance is no longer to be relied on	81.22971024908115
But Morrel Albert is your friend	34.973760944481654
You met on the same day you first saw me	52.34402879807388
Yes that is true but I should not have recollected it if you had not reminded me	39.4553138971849
Then ringing the bell once Look	27816.618275026354
said he to Ali who came immediately take that to my solicitor	705.939189651632
When I am dead you will go and examine it	32.66844464633472
Yes must I not be prepared for everything dear friend But what did you do yesterday after you left me	83.08472263592928
I went to Tortonis where as I expected I found Beauchamp and ChteauRenaud	119.21026366031441
I own I was seeking them	72.79569246808438
Listen count the affair is serious and unavoidable	956.1755286047471
No the offence was public and everyone is already talking of it	108.88932549868524
Well I hoped to get an exchange of armsto substitute the sword for the pistol the pistol is blind	352.73941348611794
Have you succeeded asked Monte Cristo quickly with an imperceptible gleam of hope	39.1979781921397
No for your skill with the sword is so well known	42.73285689898823
The skilful swordsman whom you have conquered	193.95060564719444
Morrel said the count have you ever seen me fire a pistol	83.35589851205474
Monte Cristo took the pistols he held in his hand when Mercds entered and fixing an ace of clubs against the iron plate with four shots he successively shot off the four sides of the club	85.38099460434042
At each shot Morrel turned pale	1.7502272029411392
He examined the bullets with which Monte Cristo performed this dexterous feat and saw that they were no larger than buckshot	202.70883888234928
Then turning towards Monte Cristo Count said he in the name of all that is dear to you I entreat you not to kill Albertthe unhappy youth has a mother	118.51429204642197
You are right said Monte Cristo and I have none	10.02398242534901
These words were uttered in a tone which made Morrel shudder	16.359473946451377
You are the offended party count	69.05105200250983
Oh I obtained or rather claimed that we had conceded enough for them to yield us that	271.5758112224977
A smile of terrible import passed over the counts lips	51.238971584410386
Morrel said he do not forget what you have just seen	24.231845255160966
The only chance for Alberts safety then will arise from your emotion	189.2716025097128
I suffer from emotion said Monte Cristo	2.6971242244657363
Or from your generosity my friend to so good a marksman as you are I may say what would appear absurd to another	114.99094855850146
Break his armwound himbut do not kill him	10.74834859980782
I will tell you Morrel said the count that I do not need entreating to spare the life of M	33.63410122455547
de Morcerf he shall be so well spared that he will return quietly with his two friends while I	85.83147667453132
That will be another thing I shall be brought home	35.93391944213303
No no cried Maximilian quite unable to restrain his feelings	41.27945835207124
As I told you my dear Morrel M	56.42348496824828
Morrel looked at him in utter amazement	155.43671337146876
But what has happened then since last evening count	286.12078074879463
The same thing that happened to Brutus the night before the battle of Philippi I have seen a ghost	129.19389352908107
Told me Morrel that I had lived long enough	95.89143121481841
Maximilian and Emmanuel looked at each other	6.4456444053910875
Monte Cristo drew out his watch	41.53111120112373
Let us go said he it is five minutes past seven and the appointment was for eight oclock	56.6560415968765
A carriage was in readiness at the door	7.640572827053682
Monte Cristo stepped into it with his two friends	29.933016749326484
He had stopped a moment in the passage to listen at a door and Maximilian and Emmanuel who had considerately passed forward a few steps thought they heard him answer by a sigh to a sob from within	93.33923875948327
As the clock struck eight they drove up to the place of meeting	57.017628621307054
We are first said Morrel looking out of the window	12.608311463586816
Excuse me sir said Baptistin who had followed his master with indescribable terror but I think I see a carriage down there under the trees	63.38225098695291
Monte Cristo sprang lightly from the carriage and offered his hand to assist Emmanuel and Maximilian	40.86978619793841
The latter retained the counts hand between his	95.15197159655877
I like said he to feel a hand like this when its owner relies on the goodness of his cause	159.83112096470194
It seems to me said Emmanuel that I see two young men down there who are evidently waiting	79.77889090302148
Monte Cristo drew Morrel a step or two behind his brotherinlaw	302.57234540225215
Maximilian said he are your affections disengaged Morrel looked at Monte Cristo with astonishment	105.58019631963333
I do not seek your confidence my dear friend	32.97716547020813
I only ask you a simple question answer itthat is all I require	308.9833782728796
I love a young girl count	954.1890126194107
Another hope defeated said the count	2.261414242058003
Then with a sigh Poor Hayde murmured he	97.81799754481992
To tell the truth count if I knew less of you I should think that you were less brave than you are	48.66914518444726
Because I sigh when thinking of someone I am leaving Come Morrel it is not like a soldier to be so bad a judge of courage	62.29218637113495
Do I regret life What is it to me who have passed twenty years between life and death Moreover do not alarm yourself Morrel this weakness if it is such is betrayed to you alone	98.52297802022326
I know the world is a drawingroom from which we must retire politely and honestly that is with a bow and our debts of honor paid	148.83982871792557
Iwhat for I hope these gentlemen have theirs	394.96187847583286
Do but make no treatyyou understand me	38.32663576905818
Morrel advanced towards Beauchamp and ChteauRenaud who seeing his intention came to meet him	35.968023696942915
The three young men bowed to each other courteously if not affably	296.2387848437692
Excuse me gentlemen said Morrel but I do not see M	11.21171714322745
He sent us word this morning replied ChteauRenaud that he would meet us on the ground	29.636638178567733
It is only five minutes past eight said he to Morrel there is not much time lost yet	97.55097004997673
Oh I made no allusion of that kind replied Morrel	48.573181889483735
There is a carriage coming said ChteauRenaud	38.87294805253275
It advanced rapidly along one of the avenues leading towards the open space where they were assembled	54.17483370299827
You are doubtless provided with pistols gentlemen M	737.3963767236137
de Monte Cristo yields his right of using his	204.1061805435786
We had anticipated this kindness on the part of the count said Beauchamp and I have brought some weapons which I bought eight or ten days since thinking to want them on a similar occasion	64.87088964800748
They are quite new and have not yet been used	45.453378612525896
Beauchamp if you assure me that M	53.08494203552951
de Morcerf does not know these pistols you may readily believe that your word will be quite sufficient	101.18239239822975
Gentlemen said ChteauRenaud it is not Morcerf coming in that carriagefaith it is Franz and Debray	253.09587839835007
The two young men he announced were indeed approaching	616.9893576216626
What chance brings you here gentlemen said ChteauRenaud shaking hands with each of them	62.6229781453696
Because said Debray Albert sent this morning to request us to come	85.177053289255
Beauchamp and ChteauRenaud exchanged looks of astonishment	142.1467290161119
I think I understand his reason said Morrel	43.54938673327167
Yesterday afternoon I received a letter from M	28.249214311344822
de Morcerf begging me to attend the Opera	84.89700652590886
And we too added Beauchamp and ChteauRenaud	96.42355330653477
Having wished you all to witness the challenge he now wishes you to be present at the combat	120.79938303026309
Exactly so said the young men you have probably guessed right	269.3440998833709
But after all these arrangements he does not come himself said ChteauRenaud	77.5077970876307
Albert is ten minutes after time	30.419232722192746
There he comes said Beauchamp on horseback at full gallop followed by a servant	27.991133931634185
How imprudent said ChteauRenaud to come on horseback to fight a duel with pistols after all the instructions I had given him	102.56116555364902
And besides said Beauchamp with a collar above his cravat an open coat and white waistcoat Why has he not painted a spot upon his heartit would have been more simple	90.17720233594261
Meanwhile Albert had arrived within ten paces of the group formed by the five young men	27.6380318234168
He jumped from his horse threw the bridle on his servants arms and joined them	69.56200950443949
He was pale and his eyes were red and swollen it was evident that he had not slept	26.635241320041107
A shade of melancholy gravity overspread his countenance which was not natural to him	48.88558936878917
I thank you gentlemen said he for having complied with my request I feel extremely grateful for this mark of friendship	149.96595320967518
Morrel had stepped back as Morcerf approached and remained at a short distance	48.97964446244582
Come there can not be too many	158.7597212956582
Sir said Maximilian you are not perhaps aware that I am M	54.01348746853049
I was not sure but I thought it might be so	29.19855675250959
So much the better the more honorable men there are here the better I shall be satisfied	65.02553319693473
Morrel said ChteauRenaud will you apprise the Count of Monte Cristo that M	22.898810412669846
de Morcerf is arrived and we are at his disposal	42.32170009764328
Morrel was preparing to fulfil his commission	180.55610924577346
Beauchamp had meanwhile drawn the box of pistols from the carriage	40.745113126020634
Stop gentlemen said Albert I have two words to say to the Count of Monte Cristo	10.821709366643194
No sir before all who are here	51.53717640118368
Alberts witnesses looked at each other	1.1393619845212042
Franz and Debray exchanged some words in a whisper and Morrel rejoiced at this unexpected incident went to fetch the count who was walking in a retired path with Emmanuel	78.56126003953521
What does he want with me said Monte Cristo	6.791964748703095
I do not know but he wishes to speak to you	19.57832584942977
Ah said Monte Cristo I trust he is not going to tempt me by some fresh insult	69.22614520582326
I do not think that such is his intention said Morrel	64.73096027250831
The count advanced accompanied by Maximilian and Emmanuel	119.47991581190034
His calm and serene look formed a singular contrast to Alberts griefstricken face who approached also followed by the other four young men	265.9813105031513
When at three paces distant from each other Albert and the count stopped	42.45299144467098
Approach gentlemen said Albert I wish you not to lose one word of what I am about to have the honor of saying to the Count of Monte Cristo for it must be repeated by you to all who will listen to it strange as it may appear to you	23.48325461494937
Sir said Albert at first with a tremulous voice but which gradually became firmer I reproached you with exposing the conduct of M	169.68489985384272
de Morcerf in Epirus for guilty as I knew he was I thought you had no right to punish him but I have since learned that you had that right	59.810872168548045
It is not Fernand Mondegos treachery towards Ali Pasha which induces me so readily to excuse you but the treachery of the fisherman Fernand towards you and the almost unheardof miseries which were its consequences and I say and proclaim it publicly that you were justified in revenging yourself on my father and I his son thank you for not using greater severity	221.0327265208567
Had a thunderbolt fallen in the midst of the spectators of this unexpected scene it would not have surprised them more than did Alberts declaration	57.55065786428975
As for Monte Cristo his eyes slowly rose towards heaven with an expression of infinite gratitude	25.15795873007811
He could not understand how Alberts fiery nature of which he had seen so much among the Roman bandits had suddenly stooped to this humiliation	157.4511561745135
He recognized the influence of Mercds and saw why her noble heart had not opposed the sacrifice she knew beforehand would be useless	139.0956448929321
Now sir said Albert if you think my apology sufficient pray give me your hand	257.8435394896067
Next to the merit of infallibility which you appear to possess I rank that of candidly acknowledging a fault	349.80975369027846
But this confession concerns me only	344.59162480209454
I acted well as a man but you have acted better than man	63.559974887022996
An angel alone could have saved one of us from deaththat angel came from heaven if not to make us friends which alas fatality renders impossible at least to make us esteem each other	180.73739598766
Monte Cristo with moistened eye heaving breast and lips half open extended to Albert a hand which the latter pressed with a sentiment resembling respectful fear	166.14664578749606
de Monte Cristo receives my apology	10394.310839176565
I had acted hastily towards him	9.331186693008034
Hasty actions are generally bad ones	11.818033943612308
I hope the world will not call me cowardly for acting as my conscience dictated	222.82162105714946
But if anyone should entertain a false opinion of me added he drawing himself up as if he would challenge both friends and enemies I shall endeavor to correct his mistake	131.04230272784733
What happened during the night asked Beauchamp of ChteauRenaud we appear to make a very sorry figure here	109.1095970162198
In truth what Albert has just done is either very despicable or very noble replied the baron	166.51023896734446
What can it mean said Debray to Franz	64.65654883210337
The Count of Monte Cristo acts dishonorably to M	1644.8840771941968
de Morcerf and is justified by his son Had I ten Yaninas in my family I should only consider myself the more bound to fight ten times	179.69424000414492
As for Monte Cristo his head was bent down his arms were powerless	63.99971462972856
Bowing under the weight of twentyfour years reminiscences he thought not of Albert of Beauchamp of ChteauRenaud or of any of that group but he thought of that courageous woman who had come to plead for her sons life to whom he had offered his and who had now saved it by the revelation of a dreadful family secret capable of destroying forever in that young mans heart every feeling of filial piety	122.56366275266086
Providence still murmured he now only am I fully convinced of being the emissary of God	155.1099888185606
The Count of Monte Cristo bowed to the five young men with a melancholy and dignified smile and got into his carriage with Maximilian and Emmanuel	43.03466157354821
Albert Beauchamp and ChteauRenaud remained alone	58.95037091771987
Albert looked at his two friends not timidly but in a way that appeared to ask their opinion of what he had just done	76.53553962748708
Indeed my dear friend said Beauchamp first who had either the most feeling or the least dissimulation allow me to congratulate you this is a very unhopedfor conclusion of a very disagreeable affair	146.28269020919166
Albert remained silent and wrapped in thought	114.10294623301154
ChteauRenaud contented himself with tapping his boot with his flexible cane	45.62319193427421
Are we not going said he after this embarrassing silence	263.7971622081752
When you please replied Beauchamp allow me only to compliment M	263.88924691840754
de Morcerf who has given proof today of rare chivalric generosity	1669.0570467137038
It is magnificent continued Beauchamp to be able to exercise so much selfcontrol	81.40599205662018
Assuredly as for me I should have been incapable of it said ChteauRenaud with most significant coolness	56.453786240998014
Gentlemen interrupted Albert I think you did not understand that something very serious had passed between M	54.9787197188278
Possibly possibly said Beauchamp immediately but every simpleton would not be able to understand your heroism and sooner or later you will find yourself compelled to explain it to them more energetically than would be convenient to your bodily health and the duration of your life	105.09386080912859
May I give you a friendly counsel Set out for Naples the Hague or St	469.6809984864701
Petersburgcalm countries where the point of honor is better understood than among our hotheaded Parisians	244.07035424355809
Seek quietude and oblivion so that you may return peaceably to France after a few years	86.00885724606258
That is quite my opinion said the gentleman nothing induces serious duels so much as a duel forsworn	348.9264096553298
Thank you gentlemen replied Albert with a smile of indifference I shall follow your advicenot because you give it but because I had before intended to quit France	71.0057503531894
I thank you equally for the service you have rendered me in being my seconds	70.84195093791206
It is deeply engraved on my heart and after what you have just said I remember that only	41.79191642323056
ChteauRenaud and Beauchamp looked at each other the impression was the same on both of them and the tone in which Morcerf had just expressed his thanks was so determined that the position would have become embarrassing for all if the conversation had continued	66.9719631734816
Goodbye Albert said Beauchamp suddenly carelessly extending his hand to the young man	13.944487639462933
The latter did not appear to arouse from his lethargy in fact he did not notice the offered hand	139.49784149854463
Goodbye said ChteauRenaud in his turn keeping his little cane in his left hand and saluting with his right	51.07180502497288
Alberts lips scarcely whispered Goodbye but his look was more explicit it expressed a whole poem of restrained anger proud disdain and generous indignation	543.2343456989337
He preserved his melancholy and motionless position for some time after his two friends had regained their carriage then suddenly unfastening his horse from the little tree to which his servant had tied it he mounted and galloped off in the direction of Paris	103.01384938906774
In a quarter of an hour he was entering the house in the Rue du Helder	12.116419962269086
As he alighted he thought he saw his fathers pale face behind the curtain of the counts bedroom	54.060506229360286
Albert turned away his head with a sigh and went to his own apartments	18.068597314568052
He cast one lingering look on all the luxuries which had rendered life so easy and so happy since his infancy he looked at the pictures whose faces seemed to smile and the landscapes which appeared painted in brighter colors	132.16107592149973
Then he took away his mothers portrait with its oaken frame leaving the gilt frame from which he took it black and empty	139.6189812744589
Then he arranged all his beautiful Turkish arms his fine English guns his Japanese china his cups mounted in silver his artistic bronzes by Feuchres or Barye examined the cupboards and placed the key in each threw into a drawer of his secretaire which he left open all the pocketmoney he had about him and with it the thousand fancy jewels from his vases and his jewelboxes then he made an exact inventory of everything and placed it in the most conspicuous part of the table after putting aside the books and papers which had collected there	156.7710194961371
At the beginning of this work his servant notwithstanding orders to the contrary came to his room	123.25335518523514
What do you want asked he with a more sorrowful than angry tone	87.78939847240007
Pardon me sir replied the valet you had forbidden me to disturb you but the Count of Morcerf has called me	35.44227511255624
I did not like to go to him without first seeing you	92.88249350506173
Because the count is doubtless aware that I accompanied you to the meeting this morning	83.98173876372336
And since he has sent for me it is doubtless to question me on what happened there	71.19491310173383
Then I shall say the duel did not take place	46.396963729790166
You will say I apologized to the Count of Monte Cristo	4.399987633268599
The valet bowed and retired and Albert returned to his inventory	91.29130160247159
As he was finishing this work the sound of horses prancing in the yard and the wheels of a carriage shaking his window attracted his attention	109.87205721003807
He approached the window and saw his father get into it and drive away	129.39417708403175
The door was scarcely closed when Albert bent his steps to his mothers room and no one being there to announce him he advanced to her bedchamber and distressed by what he saw and guessed stopped for one moment at the door	70.08942997598317
As if the same idea had animated these two beings Mercds was doing the same in her apartments that he had just done in his	77.24097961769502
Everything was in orderlaces dresses jewels linen money all were arranged in the drawers and the countess was carefully collecting the keys	257.856553467535
Albert saw all these preparations and understood them and exclaiming My mother he threw his arms around her neck	98.31221888620131
The artist who could have depicted the expression of these two countenances would certainly have made of them a beautiful picture	159.27167814794595
All these proofs of an energetic resolution which Albert did not fear on his own account alarmed him for his mother	53.681565583102845
What are you doing asked he	19.915664373579343
What were you doing replied she	191.131219467116
Oh my mother exclaimed Albert so overcome he could scarcely speak it is not the same with you and meyou can not have made the same resolution I have for I have come to warn you that I bid adieu to your house andand to you	62.79078221089225
I also replied Mercds am going and I acknowledge I had depended on your accompanying me have I deceived myself	111.25247994042901
I can not make you share the fate I have planned for myself	131.27183917115764
I must live henceforth without rank and fortune and to begin this hard apprenticeship I must borrow from a friend the loaf I shall eat until I have earned one	211.7900008090294
So my dear mother I am going at once to ask Franz to lend me the small sum I shall require to supply my present wants	59.221345472854225
You my poor child suffer poverty and hunger Oh do not say so it will break my resolutions	113.28228504331987
But not mine mother replied Albert	83.85023792265076
I am young and strong I believe I am courageous and since yesterday I have learned the power of will	56.71264287818231
Alas my dear mother some have suffered so much and yet live and have raised a new fortune on the ruin of all the promises of happiness which heaven had made themon the fragments of all the hope which God had given them I have seen that mother I know that from the gulf in which their enemies have plunged them they have risen with so much vigor and glory that in their turn they have ruled their former conquerors and have punished them	96.49974757711192
No mother from this moment I have done with the past and accept nothing from itnot even a name because you can understand that your son can not bear the name of a man who ought to blush for it before another	59.15970067613487
Albert my child said Mercds if I had a stronger heart that is the counsel I would have given you your conscience has spoken when my voice became too weak listen to its dictates	122.74056357760807
You had friends Albert break off their acquaintance	80.0694033727029
But do not despair you have life before you my dear Albert for you are yet scarcely twentytwo years old and as a pure heart like yours wants a spotless name take my fathersit was Herrera	203.85439737003807
I am sure my dear Albert whatever may be your career you will soon render that name illustrious	206.38991334964308
Then my son return to the world still more brilliant because of your former sorrows and if I am wrong still let me cherish these hopes for I have no future to look forward to	73.11713872533633
For me the grave opens when I pass the threshold of this house	37.39995387997157
I will fulfil all your wishes my dear mother said the young man	14.291154211154486
Yes I share your hopes the anger of Heaven will not pursue us since you are pure and I am innocent	54.091560439920706
But since our resolution is formed let us act promptly	426.7649045821398
de Morcerf went out about half an hour ago the opportunity is favorable to avoid an explanation	55.25770643128825
I am ready my son said Mercds	19.645778434641215
Albert ran to fetch a carriage	82.53317868876083
He recollected that there was a small furnished house to let in the Rue des SaintsPres where his mother would find a humble but decent lodging and thither he intended conducting the countess	222.96030497410234
As the carriage stopped at the door and Albert was alighting a man approached and gave him a letter	59.560282279654686
Albert took the letter opened and read it then looked round for Bertuccio but he was gone	57.71483442885223
He returned to Mercds with tears in his eyes and heaving breast and without uttering a word he gave her the letter	52.15354162624169
AlbertWhile showing you that I have discovered your plans I hope also to convince you of my delicacy	101.91210220682818
You are free you leave the counts house and you take your mother to your home but reflect Albert you owe her more than your poor noble heart can pay her	101.00330687717418
Keep the struggle for yourself bear all the suffering but spare her the trial of poverty which must accompany your first efforts for she deserves not even the shadow of the misfortune which has this day fallen on her and Providence is not willing that the innocent should suffer for the guilty	180.65834129261486
I know you are going to leave the Rue du Helder without taking anything with you	27.39388634992168
Do not seek to know how I discovered it I know itthat is sufficient	191.07888024321244
Twentyfour years ago I returned proud and joyful to my country	379.1946019655453
I had a betrothed Albert a lovely girl whom I adored and I was bringing to my betrothed a hundred and fifty louis painfully amassed by ceaseless toil	220.169700895463
This money was for her I destined it for her and knowing the treachery of the sea I buried our treasure in the little garden of the house my father lived in at Marseilles on the Alles de Meilhan	74.59892837328671
Your mother Albert knows that poor house well	609.0993701016578
A short time since I passed through Marseilles and went to see the old place which revived so many painful recollections and in the evening I took a spade and dug in the corner of the garden where I had concealed my treasure	78.00182933710703
The iron box was thereno one had touched itunder a beautiful figtree my father had planted the day I was born which overshadowed the spot	264.03272098157595
Well Albert this money which was formerly designed to promote the comfort and tranquillity of the woman I adored may now through strange and painful circumstances be devoted to the same purpose	272.4985138209225
Oh feel for me who could offer millions to that poor woman but who return her only the piece of black bread forgotten under my poor roof since the day I was torn from her I loved	162.55367444900622
You are a generous man Albert but perhaps you may be blinded by pride or resentment if you refuse me if you ask another for what I have a right to offer you I will say it is ungenerous of you to refuse the life of your mother at the hands of a man whose father was allowed by your father to die in all the horrors of poverty and despair	60.533807474350425
Albert stood pale and motionless to hear what his mother would decide after she had finished reading this letter	199.14490188728772
Mercds turned her eyes with an ineffable look towards heaven	52.10283770367302
I accept it said she he has a right to pay the dowry which I shall take with me to some convent	39.1690011551275
Putting the letter in her bosom she took her sons arm and with a firmer step than she even herself expected she went downstairs	63.7543863144919
Meanwhile Monte Cristo had also returned to town with Emmanuel and Maximilian	111.51391121450564
Emmanuel did not conceal his joy at the peaceful termination of the affair and was loud in his expressions of delight	101.86667480399991
Morrel in a corner of the carriage allowed his brotherinlaws gayety to expend itself in words while he felt equal inward joy which however betrayed itself only in his countenance	220.10916454355078
At the Barrire du Trne they met Bertuccio who was waiting there motionless as a sentinel at his post	52.33683531805613
Monte Cristo put his head out of the window exchanged a few words with him in a low tone and the steward disappeared	19.41187049287011
Count said Emmanuel when they were at the end of the Place Royale put me down at my door that my wife may not have a single moment of needless anxiety on my account or yours	57.6084136657541
If it were not ridiculous to make a display of our triumph said Morrel I would invite the count to our house besides that he doubtless has some trembling heart to comfort	115.01946547317252
So we will take leave of our friend and let him hasten home	71.14741536595761
Stop a moment said Monte Cristo do not let me lose both my companions	31.488769001945442
Return Emmanuel to your charming wife and present my best compliments to her and do you Morrel accompany me to the Champslyses	92.93413043475461
Willingly said Maximilian particularly as I have business in that quarter	73.56382673142957
Shall we wait breakfast for you asked Emmanuel	58.37351433311992
The door was closed and the carriage proceeded	59.2025470393094
See what good fortune I brought you said Morrel when he was alone with the count	29.59136383505185
Yes said Monte Cristo for that reason I wished to keep you near me	35.33539827314689
It is miraculous continued Morrel answering his own thoughts	130.5314531147102
Yes said the Count you are rightit is miraculous	341.9874675634257
For Albert is brave resumed Morrel	6.49407059540012
Very brave said Monte Cristo I have seen him sleep with a sword suspended over his head	36.92963892383386
And I know he has fought two duels said Morrel	200.31577580575967
How can you reconcile that with his conduct this morning	132.35577534168522
All owing to your influence replied Monte Cristo smiling	10.282669038082915
It is well for Albert he is not in the army said Morrel	25.166278277552475
An apology on the ground said the young captain shaking his head	28.093353633939433
Come said the count mildly do not entertain the prejudices of ordinary men Morrel Acknowledge that if Albert is brave he can not be a coward he must then have had some reason for acting as he did this morning and confess that his conduct is more heroic than otherwise	111.67729075751068
Doubtless doubtless said Morrel but I shall say like the Spaniard He has not been so brave today as he was yesterday	85.74880270700203
You will breakfast with me will you not Morrel said the count to turn the conversation	27.349868138419826
No I must leave you at ten oclock	16.1893539431144
Your engagement was for breakfast then said the count	9.265890467856954
Morrel smiled and shook his head	1.4315987946621764
But if I am not hungry said the young man	16.73154941204707
Oh said the count I only know two things which destroy the appetitegriefand as I am happy to see you very cheerful it is not thatand love	147.1157006809057
Now after what you told me this morning of your heart I may believe	27.864077231337156
Well count replied Morrel gayly I will not dispute it	38.1844895138754
But you will not make me your confidant Maximilian said the count in a tone which showed how gladly he would have been admitted to the secret	33.69528770668524
I showed you this morning that I had a heart did I not count Monte Cristo only answered by extending his hand to the young man	34.558120217189796
Well continued the latter since that heart is no longer with you in the Bois de Vincennes it is elsewhere and I must go and find it	40.506528644578346
Go said the count deliberately go dear friend but promise me if you meet with any obstacle to remember that I have some power in this world that I am happy to use that power in the behalf of those I love and that I love you Morrel	53.184437791283365
I will remember it said the young man as selfish children recollect their parents when they want their aid	173.7327353059843
When I need your assistance and the moment arrives I will come to you count	72.95845330010255
Well I rely upon your promise	115.53458159339291
They had arrived in the Champslyses	128.413693697249
Monte Cristo opened the carriagedoor Morrel sprang out on the pavement Bertuccio was waiting on the steps	36.43601612128382
Morrel disappeared down the Avenue de Marigny and Monte Cristo hastened to join Bertuccio	50.245851003222775
She is going to leave her house said the steward	31.08224728573289
Florentin his valet thinks he is going to do the same	18.231978493500705
Monte Cristo took Bertuccio into his study wrote the letter we have seen and gave it to the steward	46.52146244988695
But first let Hayde be informed that I have returned	47.33834268883212
Here I am said the young girl who at the sound of the carriage had run downstairs and whose face was radiant with joy at seeing the count return safely	45.955120937095415
Every transport of a daughter finding a father all the delight of a mistress seeing an adored lover were felt by Hayde during the first moments of this meeting which she had so eagerly expected	122.13053446839102
Doubtless although less evident Monte Cristos joy was not less intense	77.52117219409331
Joy to hearts which have suffered long is like the dew on the ground after a long drought both the heart and the ground absorb that beneficent moisture falling on them and nothing is outwardly apparent	279.46234350889387
Monte Cristo was beginning to think what he had not for a long time dared to believe that there were two Mercds in the world and he might yet be happy	62.38768274507639
His eye elate with happiness was reading eagerly the tearful gaze of Hayde when suddenly the door opened	90.27690685834274
de Morcerf said Baptistin as if that name sufficed for his excuse	264.3739957656171
In fact the counts face brightened	5425.257736651538
Which asked he the viscount or the count	38.98292023979754
Oh exclaimed Hayde is it not yet over	77.0400413351684
I know not if it is finished my beloved child said Monte Cristo taking the young girls hands but I do know you have nothing more to fear	27.924001200628012
That man can not injure me Hayde said Monte Cristo it was his son alone that there was cause to fear	53.47574804084094
And what I have suffered said the young girl you shall never know my lord	22.551480960932174
By my fathers tomb said he extending his hand over the head of the young girl I swear to you Hayde that if any misfortune happens it will not be to me	26.373929465454932
I believe you my lord as implicitly as if God had spoken to me said the young girl presenting her forehead to him	46.75053679927314
Monte Cristo pressed on that pure beautiful forehead a kiss which made two hearts throb at once the one violently the other secretly	299.978417241332
Oh murmured the count shall I then be permitted to love again Ask M	143.86323860286106
de Morcerf into the drawingroom said he to Baptistin while he led the beautiful Greek girl to a private staircase	107.08066816457396
We must explain this visit which although expected by Monte Cristo is unexpected to our readers	125.72326285702928
While Mercds as we have said was making a similar inventory of her property to Alberts while she was arranging her jewels shutting her drawers collecting her keys to leave everything in perfect order she did not perceive a pale and sinister face at a glass door which threw light into the passage from which everything could be both seen and heard	125.79762646135065
He who was thus looking without being heard or seen probably heard and saw all that passed in Madame de Morcerfs apartments	82.34796987932866
From that glass door the palefaced man went to the counts bedroom and raised with a constricted hand the curtain of a window overlooking the courtyard	130.28110028935743
He remained there ten minutes motionless and dumb listening to the beating of his own heart	110.92679102790495
For him those ten minutes were very long	171.1712898922553
It was then Albert returning from his meeting with the count perceived his father watching for his arrival behind a curtain and turned aside	68.10389334494346
The counts eye expanded he knew Albert had insulted the count dreadfully and that in every country in the world such an insult would lead to a deadly duel	98.70362376496512
Albert returned safelythen the count was revenged	382.0235948177104
An indescribable ray of joy illumined that wretched countenance like the last ray of the sun before it disappears behind the clouds which bear the aspect not of a downy couch but of a tomb	87.50292388266834
But as we have said he waited in vain for his son to come to his apartment with the account of his triumph	44.09613955646123
He easily understood why his son did not come to see him before he went to avenge his fathers honor but when that was done why did not his son come and throw himself into his arms	39.917768184570654
It was then when the count could not see Albert that he sent for his servant who he knew was authorized not to conceal anything from him	67.19447810387194
Ten minutes afterwards General Morcerf was seen on the steps in a black coat with a military collar black pantaloons and black gloves	51.874056456136756
He had apparently given previous orders for as he reached the bottom step his carriage came from the coachhouse ready for him	79.70332281324733
The valet threw into the carriage his military cloak in which two swords were wrapped and shutting the door he took his seat by the side of the coachman	47.56013010677045
The coachman stooped down for his orders	46.47715981795128
To the Champslyses said the general the Count of Monte Cristos	19.77139946526981
The horses bounded beneath the whip and in five minutes they stopped before the counts door	67.83532412015661
de Morcerf opened the door himself and as the carriage rolled away he passed up the walk rang and entered the open door with his servant	63.96019330776408
A moment afterwards Baptistin announced the Count of Morcerf to Monte Cristo and the latter leading Hayde aside ordered that Morcerf be asked into the drawingroom	71.49114846836936
The general was pacing the room the third time when in turning he perceived Monte Cristo at the door	47.504978498955694
de Morcerf said Monte Cristo quietly I thought I had not heard aright	72.77934943535038
Yes it is I said the count whom a frightful contraction of the lips prevented from articulating freely	314.34961393021683
May I know the cause which procures me the pleasure of seeing M	63.26781180387161
Had you not a meeting with my son this morning asked the general	46.77028188812292
And I know my son had good reasons to wish to fight with you and to endeavor to kill you	53.61751340702395
Yes sir he had very good ones but you see that in spite of them he has not killed me and did not even fight	39.59413363651451
Yet he considered you the cause of his fathers dishonor the cause of the fearful ruin which has fallen on my house	41.82493282973559
It is true sir said Monte Cristo with his dreadful calmness a secondary cause but not the principal	62.10372996382276
Doubtless you made then some apology or explanation	1200.3202009263757
I explained nothing and it is he who apologized to me	42.26004366635905
But to what do you attribute this conduct	710.3720911684871
To the conviction probably that there was one more guilty than I	42.912673177289676
That may be said the count turning pale but you know the guilty do not like to find themselves convicted	84.10326091954052
I know it and I expected this result	497.5634841074414
You expected my son would be a coward cried the count	31.158653891874113
Albert de Morcerf is no coward said Monte Cristo	35.33350807232444
A man who holds a sword in his hand and sees a mortal enemy within reach of that sword and does not fight is a coward Why is he not here that I may tell him so	66.05803201766282
Sir replied Monte Cristo coldly I did not expect that you had come here to relate to me your little family affairs	51.51653662999898
Albert that and he may know what to answer you	66.58385327256771
Oh no no said the general smiling faintly I did not come for that purpose you are right	58.88155350187676
I came to tell you that I also look upon you as my enemy	48.280568949230926
I came to tell you that I hate you instinctively that it seems as if I had always known you and always hated you and in short since the young people of the present day will not fight it remains for us to do so	59.15996121471586
And when I told you I had foreseen the result it is the honor of your visit I alluded to	57.18797388750555
You know that we shall fight till one of us is dead said the general whose teeth were clenched with rage	55.53753937044974
Until one of us dies repeated Monte Cristo moving his head slightly up and down	34.76809692553789
Let us start then we need no witnesses	144.80699675045634
Very true said Monte Cristo it is unnecessary we know each other so well	70.37602553602319
On the contrary said the count we know so little of each other	31.03894761948439
Indeed said Monte Cristo with the same indomitable coolness let us see	95.88568641783017
Are you not the soldier Fernand who deserted on the eve of the battle of Waterloo Are you not the Lieutenant Fernand who served as guide and spy to the French army in Spain Are you not the Captain Fernand who betrayed sold and murdered his benefactor Ali And have not all these Fernands united made LieutenantGeneral the Count of Morcerf peer of France	112.88762434601337
Oh cried the general as if branded with a hot iron wretchto reproach me with my shame when about perhaps to kill me No I did not say I was a stranger to you	99.21022872471758
I know well demon that you have penetrated into the darkness of the past and that you have read by the light of what torch I know not every page of my life but perhaps I may be more honorable in my shame than you under your pompous coverings	90.92656599126386
Nono I am aware you know me but I know you only as an adventurer sewn up in gold and jewellery	77.2039268273467
You call yourself in Paris the Count of Monte Cristo in Italy Sinbad the Sailor in Malta I forget what	38.68663800518068
But it is your real name I want to know in the midst of your hundred names that I may pronounce it when we meet to fight at the moment when I plunge my sword through your heart	50.86815028574775
The Count of Monte Cristo turned dreadfully pale his eye seemed to burn with a devouring fire	121.20663550038216
He leaped towards a dressingroom near his bedroom and in less than a moment tearing off his cravat his coat and waistcoat he put on a sailors jacket and hat from beneath which rolled his long black hair	56.60325786314714
He returned thus formidable and implacable advancing with his arms crossed on his breast towards the general who could not understand why he had disappeared but who on seeing him again and feeling his teeth chatter and his legs sink under him drew back and only stopped when he found a table to support his clenched hand	85.8150825051744
Fernand cried he of my hundred names I need only tell you one to overwhelm you But you guess it now do you notor rather you remember it For notwithstanding all my sorrows and my tortures I show you today a face which the happiness of revenge makes young againa face you must often have seen in your dreams since your marriage with Mercds my betrothed	239.81936459903906
The general with his head thrown back hands extended gaze fixed looked silently at this dreadful apparition then seeking the wall to support him he glided along close to it until he reached the door through which he went out backwards uttering this single mournful lamentable distressing cry	184.35614028320325
Then with sighs which were unlike any human sound he dragged himself to the door reeled across the courtyard and falling into the arms of his valet he said in a voice scarcely intelligibleHome home	89.48378929881528
The fresh air and the shame he felt at having exposed himself before his servants partly recalled his senses but the ride was short and as he drew near his house all his wretchedness revived	137.4537388136198
He stopped at a short distance from the house and alighted	23.498485679946583
The door was wide open a hackneycoach was standing in the middle of the yarda strange sight before so noble a mansion the count looked at it with terror but without daring to inquire its meaning he rushed towards his apartment	110.66632042737471
Two persons were coming down the stairs he had only time to creep into an alcove to avoid them	86.35988017335855
It was Mercds leaning on her sons arm and leaving the house	28.174592466102396
They passed close by the unhappy being who concealed behind the damask curtain almost felt Mercds dress brush past him and his sons warm breath pronouncing these words	479.2988901099771
Courage mother Come this is no longer our home	33.50243049698367
The words died away the steps were lost in the distance	58.43092602004088
The general drew himself up clinging to the curtain he uttered the most dreadful sob which ever escaped from the bosom of a father abandoned at the same time by his wife and son	41.521009148556224
He soon heard the clatter of the iron step of the hackneycoach then the coachmans voice and then the rolling of the heavy vehicle shook the windows	98.7591983540352
He darted to his bedroom to see once more all he had loved in the world but the hackneycoach drove on and the head of neither Mercds nor her son appeared at the window to take a last look at the house or the deserted father and husband	74.93752145296482
And at the very moment when the wheels of that coach crossed the gateway a report was heard and a thick smoke escaped through one of the panes of the window which was broken by the explosion	84.01112078574349
We may easily conceive where Morrels appointment was	644.2198111130077
On leaving Monte Cristo he walked slowly towards Villeforts we say slowly for Morrel had more than half an hour to spare to go five hundred steps but he had hastened to take leave of Monte Cristo because he wished to be alone with his thoughts	50.9006504353608
He knew his time wellthe hour when Valentine was giving Noirtier his breakfast and was sure not to be disturbed in the performance of this pious duty	93.65889775411124
Noirtier and Valentine had given him leave to go twice a week and he was now availing himself of that permission	65.00781825083973
He arrived Valentine was expecting him	43.568365768908926
Uneasy and almost crazed she seized his hand and led him to her grandfather	18.02388920081435
This uneasiness amounting almost to frenzy arose from the report Morcerfs adventure had made in the world for the affair at the Opera was generally known	108.47783432772398
No one at Villeforts doubted that a duel would ensue from it	98.35369538531992
Valentine with her womans instinct guessed that Morrel would be Monte Cristos second and from the young mans wellknown courage and his great affection for the count she feared that he would not content himself with the passive part assigned to him	81.35413188703016
We may easily understand how eagerly the particulars were asked for given and received and Morrel could read an indescribable joy in the eyes of his beloved when she knew that the termination of this affair was as happy as it was unexpected	85.68081461524312
Now said Valentine motioning to Morrel to sit down near her grandfather while she took her seat on his footstoolnow let us talk about our own affairs	39.16138629803111
You know Maximilian grandpapa once thought of leaving this house and taking an apartment away from M	108.74601124883173
Yes said Maximilian I recollect the project of which I highly approved	192.34860831829363
Well said Valentine you may approve again for grandpapa is again thinking of it	252.15641822404925
And do you know said Valentine what reason grandpapa gives for leaving this house	210.87770842428787
Noirtier looked at Valentine to impose silence but she did not notice him her looks her eyes her smile were all for Morrel	99.7176446050432
Noirtiers reason answered Morrel I can readily believe it to be a good one	40.48174891638444
He pretends the air of the Faubourg SaintHonor is not good for me	22.653438434123956
Indeed said Morrel in that M	721.1524816016858
Noirtier may be right you have not seemed to be well for the last fortnight	41.240232740986976
And grandpapa has become my physician and I have the greatest confidence in him because he knows everything	61.85250132743507
Do you then really suffer asked Morrel quickly	23.463029877019824
Oh it must not be called suffering I feel a general uneasiness that is all	138.49540585960037
I have lost my appetite and my stomach feels as if it were struggling to get accustomed to something	92.79816305724582
Noirtier did not lose a word of what Valentine said	25.633603149324255
And what treatment do you adopt for this singular complaint	591.382646832167
A very simple one said Valentine	56.674719281600346
I swallow every morning a spoonful of the mixture prepared for my grandfather	127.1664458823107
When I say one spoonful I began by onenow I take four	480.5790234612361
Grandpapa says it is a panacea	62034.74942950832
Valentine smiled but it was evident that she suffered	71.40056046030062
Maximilian in his devotedness gazed silently at her	47.78105409877063
She was very beautiful but her usual pallor had increased her eyes were more brilliant than ever and her hands which were generally white like motherofpearl now more resembled wax to which time was adding a yellowish hue	135.41364973010872
From Valentine the young man looked towards Noirtier	115.93905120937738
The latter watched with strange and deep interest the young girl absorbed by her affection and he also like Morrel followed those traces of inward suffering which was so little perceptible to a common observer that they escaped the notice of everyone but the grandfather and the lover	125.91193497881757
But said Morrel I thought this mixture of which you now take four spoonfuls was prepared for M	160.92171875110148
I know it is very bitter said Valentine so bitter that all I drink afterwards appears to have the same taste	130.41257887541244
Noirtier looked inquiringly at his granddaughter	1263.7159769616965
Yes grandpapa said Valentine it is so	8.358273986037874
Just now before I came down to you I drank a glass of sugared water I left half because it seemed so bitter	102.30573412861251
Noirtier turned pale and made a sign that he wished to speak	10.054547840282098
Valentine rose to fetch the dictionary	1876.8850144244873
Noirtier watched her with evident anguish	73.8647767357008
In fact the blood was rushing to the young girls head already her cheeks were becoming red	136.55008659285411
Oh cried she without losing any of her cheerfulness this is singular I ca nt see Did the sun shine in my eyes And she leaned against the window	101.89290149400779
The sun is not shining said Morrel more alarmed by Noirtiers expression than by Valentines indisposition	77.76151614282593
Cheer up said she to Noirtier	105.56874120454773
Do not be alarmed Maximilian it is nothing and has already passed away	71.33799829245253
But listen Do I not hear a carriage in the courtyard She opened Noirtiers door ran to a window in the passage and returned hastily	69.82743560597152
Yes said she it is Madame Danglars and her daughter who have come to call on us	27.31581724965558
GoodbyeI must run away for they would send here for me or rather farewell till I see you again	78.52301425245419
Stay with grandpapa Maximilian I promise you not to persuade them to stay	52.57597285462158
Morrel watched her as she left the room he heard her ascend the little staircase which led both to Madame de Villeforts apartments and to hers	62.59745696372025
As soon as she was gone Noirtier made a sign to Morrel to take the dictionary	40.56640092554988
Morrel obeyed guided by Valentine he had learned how to understand the old man quickly	50.677959016373066
Accustomed however as he was to the work he had to repeat most of the letters of the alphabet and to find every word in the dictionary so that it was ten minutes before the thought of the old man was translated by these words	53.61112494491375
Fetch the glass of water and the decanter from Valentines room	46.96714260150422
Morrel rang immediately for the servant who had taken Barroiss situation and in Noirtiers name gave that order	143.94449165749262
The decanter and the glass were completely empty	105.57095614811959
Noirtier made a sign that he wished to speak	8.721793731661142
Why are the glass and decanter empty asked he Valentine said she only drank half the glassful	394.834978456047
The translation of this new question occupied another five minutes	360.17440869161095
I do not know said the servant but the housemaid is in Mademoiselle Valentines room perhaps she has emptied them	122.6280597279287
Ask her said Morrel translating Noirtiers thought this time by his look	169.43698098939572
The servant went out but returned almost immediately	331.6561584938122
Mademoiselle Valentine passed through the room to go to Madame de Villeforts said he and in passing as she was thirsty she drank what remained in the glass as for the decanter Master Edward had emptied that to make a pond for his ducks	108.9717462347106
Noirtier raised his eyes to heaven as a gambler does who stakes his all on one stroke	230.4230485424717
From that moment the old mans eyes were fixed on the door and did not quit it	11.925847676130482
It was indeed Madame Danglars and her daughter whom Valentine had seen they had been ushered into Madame de Villeforts room who had said she would receive them there	34.93587527956599
That is why Valentine passed through her room which was on a level with Valentines and only separated from it by Edwards	100.52105136722034
The two ladies entered the drawingroom with that sort of official stiffness which preludes a formal communication	363.86405342351236
Among worldly people manner is contagious	87002.94789243674
Madame de Villefort received them with equal solemnity	237.59707725937352
Valentine entered at this moment and the formalities were resumed	189.5500002867887
My dear friend said the baroness while the two young people were shaking hands I and Eugnie are come to be the first to announce to you the approaching marriage of my daughter with Prince Cavalcanti	75.67893021386821
Danglars kept up the title of prince	37.27969834558322
The popular banker found that it answered better than count	386.40349333541917
Allow me to present you my sincere congratulations replied Madame de Villefort	94.13800791258679
Prince Cavalcanti appears to be a young man of rare qualities	69.60454861449047
Listen said the baroness smiling speaking to you as a friend I can say that the prince does not yet appear all he will be	41.42561363637306
He has about him a little of that foreign manner by which French persons recognize at first sight the Italian or German nobleman	361.5677141669682
Besides he gives evidence of great kindness of disposition much keenness of wit and as to suitability M	367.04821431468804
Danglars assures me that his fortune is majesticthat is his word	174.95026031624806
And then said Eugnie while turning over the leaves of Madame de Villeforts album add that you have taken a great fancy to the young man	39.43097164478671
And said Madame de Villefort I need not ask you if you share that fancy	91.09919384082191
I replied Eugnie with her usual candor	576.7929636727935
Oh not the least in the world madame My wish was not to confine myself to domestic cares or the caprices of any man but to be an artist and consequently free in heart in person and in thought	122.45410271931233
Eugnie pronounced these words with so firm a tone that the color mounted to Valentines cheeks	96.71783331176914
The timid girl could not understand that vigorous nature which appeared to have none of the timidities of woman	93.95910547213005
At any rate said she since I am to be married whether I will or not I ought to be thankful to Providence for having released me from my engagement with M	56.58559432524021
Albert de Morcerf or I should this day have been the wife of a dishonored man	64.02095621293444
It is true said the baroness with that strange simplicity sometimes met with among fashionable ladies and of which plebeian intercourse can never entirely deprive themit is very true that had not the Morcerfs hesitated my daughter would have married Monsieur Albert	310.14064032969276
The general depended much on it he even came to force M	129.69833870087848
We have had a narrow escape	119.28824343443475
But said Valentine timidly does all the fathers shame revert upon the son Monsieur Albert appears to me quite innocent of the treason charged against the general	184.37689537231307
Excuse me said the implacable young girl Monsieur Albert claims and well deserves his share	569.2689310893874
It appears that after having challenged M	2149.5764138553936
de Monte Cristo at the Opera yesterday he apologized on the ground today	136.3900371168692
Ah my dear friend said Madame Danglars with the same simplicity we before noticed it is a fact	47.38294812127433
Debray who was present at the explanation	61.59111795544462
Valentine also knew the truth but she did not answer	19.682747776282067
A single word had reminded her that Morrel was expecting her in M	72.24477407734142
Deeply engaged with a sort of inward contemplation Valentine had ceased for a moment to join in the conversation	76.61795908035225
She would indeed have found it impossible to repeat what had been said the last few minutes when suddenly Madame Danglars hand pressed on her arm aroused her from her lethargy	73.24314565275574
What is it said she starting at Madame Danglars touch as she would have done from an electric shock	106.49505134509229
It is my dear Valentine said the baroness that you are doubtless suffering	32.131464203254794
I said the young girl passing her hand across her burning forehead	44.79052238625939
Yes look at yourself in that glass you have turned pale and then red successively three or four times in one minute	59.33287717077526
Indeed cried Eugnie you are very pale	83.53353316729756
Oh do not be alarmed I have been so for many days	29.951751436254064
Artless as she was the young girl knew that this was an opportunity to leave and besides Madame de Villefort came to her assistance	38.20301177572779
Retire Valentine said she you are really suffering and these ladies will excuse you drink a glass of pure water it will restore you	77.97357835492221
Valentine kissed Eugnie bowed to Madame Danglars who had already risen to take her leave and went out	25.66528065259442
That poor child said Madame de Villefort when Valentine was gone she makes me very uneasy and I should not be astonished if she had some serious illness	54.78540208058108
Meanwhile Valentine in a sort of excitement which she could not quite understand had crossed Edwards room without noticing some trick of the child and through her own had reached the little staircase	114.20063815441077
She was within three steps of the bottom she already heard Morrels voice when suddenly a cloud passed over her eyes her stiffened foot missed the step her hands had no power to hold the baluster and falling against the wall she lost her balance wholly and toppled to the floor	134.2534185053879
Morrel bounded to the door opened it and found Valentine stretched out at the bottom of the stairs	18.65942016803223
Quick as a flash he raised her in his arms and placed her in a chair	22.951348318811135
Oh what a clumsy thing I am said she with feverish volubility I do nt know my way	78.2622343536869
I forgot there were three more steps before the landing	115.91611059948438
You have hurt yourself perhaps said Morrel	11.689126525029549
What can I do for you Valentine	83.47920520325943
Valentine looked around her she saw the deepest terror depicted in Noirtiers eyes	88.8222335317986
Do nt worry dear grandpapa said she endeavoring to smile it is nothingit is nothing I was giddy that is all	100.07093051879303
Another attack of giddiness said Morrel clasping his hands	5.350736234528054
Oh attend to it Valentine I entreat you	18.669449398597582
But no said Valentineno I tell you it is all past and it was nothing	38.273073058318246
Now let me tell you some news Eugnie is to be married in a week and in three days there is to be a grand feast a betrothal festival	80.25658523620531
We are all invited my father Madame de Villefort and Iat least I understood it so	79.90382391798416
When will it be our turn to think of these things Oh Valentine you who have so much influence over your grandpapa try to make him answerSoon	90.13344667192003
And do you said Valentine depend on me to stimulate the tardiness and arouse the memory of grandpapa	281.54670941867204
So long as you are not mine Valentine I shall always think I may lose you	52.82637573499587
Oh replied Valentine with a convulsive movement oh indeed Maximilian you are too timid for an officer for a soldier who they say never knows fear	132.46439502806737
She burst into a forced and melancholy laugh her arms stiffened and twisted her head fell back on her chair and she remained motionless	49.17751992108896
The cry of terror which was stopped on Noirtiers lips seemed to start from his eyes	37.26537472712083
Morrel understood it he knew he must call assistance	113.32049236004235
The young man rang the bell violently the housemaid who had been in Mademoiselle Valentines room and the servant who had replaced Barrois ran in at the same moment	44.86687866113919
Valentine was so pale so cold so inanimate that without listening to what was said to them they were seized with the fear which pervaded that house and they flew into the passage crying for help	124.98728296704112
Madame Danglars and Eugnie were going out at that moment they heard the cause of the disturbance	33.24418674782566
I told you so exclaimed Madame de Villefort	9.22677979083919
de Villeforts voice was heard calling from his study What is the matter	41.7174252857242
Morrel looked at Noirtier who had recovered his selfcommand and with a glance indicated the closet where once before under somewhat similar circumstances he had taken refuge	174.03096154662254
He had only time to get his hat and throw himself breathless into the closet when the procureurs footstep was heard in the passage	55.494793434404365
Villefort sprang into the room ran to Valentine and took her in his arms	17.368224376772783
dAvrigny cried Villefort or rather I will go for him myself	29.719977924935524
He flew from the apartment and Morrel at the same moment darted out at the other door	25.87222600398685
He had been struck to the heart by a frightful recollectionthe conversation he had heard between the doctor and Villefort the night of Madame de SaintMrans death recurred to him these symptoms to a less alarming extent were the same which had preceded the death of Barrois	104.72452297930462
At the same time Monte Cristos voice seemed to resound in his ear with the words he had heard only two hours before Whatever you want Morrel come to me I have great power	58.817701362953215
More rapidly than thought he darted down the Rue Matignon and thence to the Avenue des Champslyses	40.28792740189808
de Villefort arrived in a hired cabriolet at M	531.3697451411381
He rang so violently that the porter was alarmed	43.45253828830001
Villefort ran upstairs without saying a word	19.339259916163744
The porter knew him and let him pass only calling to him	77.26447285587558
In his study Monsieur Procureurin his study Villefort pushed or rather forced the door open	170.89773476152322
Ah said the doctor is it you	62.02619531169323
Yes said Villefort closing the door after him it is I who am come in my turn to ask you if we are quite alone	32.23560212048631
What said the latter with apparent coolness but with deep emotion have you another invalid	213.11339972513383
Yes doctor cried Villefort clutching his hair yes	53.989505096980274
DAvrignys look implied I told you it would be so	9.073818026068261
Then he slowly uttered these words Who is now dying in your house What new victim is going to accuse you of weakness before God	77.24313221102399
A mournful sob burst from Villeforts heart he approached the doctor and seizing his armValentine said he it is Valentines turn	86.90452410836804
Your daughter cried dAvrigny with grief and surprise	29.608054138582514
You see you were deceived murmured the magistrate come and see her and on her bed of agony entreat her pardon for having suspected her	106.76367058370316
Each time you have applied to me said the doctor it has been too late still I will go	19.663052621349276
But let us make haste sir with the enemies you have to do with there is no time to be lost	33.32714642918149
Oh this time doctor you shall not have to reproach me with weakness	52.64082745710587
This time I will know the assassin and will pursue him	49.71610458598962
Let us try first to save the victim before we think of revenging her said dAvrigny	202.29848387176298
The same cabriolet which had brought Villefort took them back at full speed and at this moment Morrel rapped at Monte Cristos door	62.63975624008591
The count was in his study and was reading with an angry look something which Bertuccio had brought in haste	87.06396367982997
Hearing the name of Morrel who had left him only two hours before the count raised his head arose and sprang to meet him	23.720640751622458
What is the matter Maximilian asked he you are pale and the perspiration rolls from your forehead	94.55251216347337
Yes said he I came quickly I wanted to speak to you	39.95976096106806
Are all your family well asked the count with an affectionate benevolence whose sincerity no one could for a moment doubt	67.0360592189451
Thank you countthank you said the young man evidently embarrassed how to begin the conversation yes everyone in my family is well	88.87277872431027
So much the better yet you have something to tell me replied the count with increased anxiety	30.67782636192649
Yes said Morrel it is true I have but now left a house where death has just entered to run to you	68.7744288212896
Are you then come from M	34.55574885952821
No said Morrel is someone dead in his house	28.12586934866725
The general has just blown his brains out replied Monte Cristo with great coolness	44.44545495732513
Oh what a dreadful event cried Maximilian	65.385411175272
Not for the countess or for Albert said Monte Cristo a dead father or husband is better than a dishonored oneblood washes out shame	227.39833742267166
Poor countess said Maximilian I pity her very much she is so noble a woman	107.54105499797639
Pity Albert also Maximilian for believe me he is the worthy son of the countess	78.05088105286498
But let us return to yourself	405.6672403058523
You have hastened to mecan I have the happiness of being useful to you	33.69687275358581
Yes I need your help that is I thought like a madman that you could lend me your assistance in a case where God alone can succor me	73.11726287504747
Tell me what it is replied Monte Cristo	16.293251994130824
Oh said Morrel I know not indeed if I may reveal this secret to mortal ears but fatality impels me necessity constrains me count Morrel hesitated	365.98254457282854
Do you think I love you said Monte Cristo taking the young mans hand affectionately in his	17.112691663084693
Oh you encourage me and something tells me there placing his hand on his heart that I ought to have no secret from you	45.04886540644648
You are right Morrel God is speaking to your heart and your heart speaks to you	34.47376004197732
Count will you allow me to send Baptistin to inquire after someone you know	158.70027754916802
I am at your service and still more my servants	99.83367148586375
Oh I can not live if she is not better	49.74691003667086
No I will go and speak to him myself	32.33087226184534
Morrel went out called Baptistin and whispered a few words to him	21.627485512877538
Well have you sent asked Monte Cristo seeing Morrel return	42.55777328823043
Yes and now I shall be more calm	59.515304422747896
You know I am waiting said Monte Cristo smiling	3.969087177583952
Yes and I will tell you	1.5941994296827184
One evening I was in a garden a clump of trees concealed me no one suspected I was there	57.507228176728475
Two persons passed near meallow me to conceal their names for the present they were speaking in an undertone and yet I was so interested in what they said that I did not lose a single word	37.91033643429962
This is a gloomy introduction if I may judge from your pallor and shuddering Morrel	130.28385517192882
Oh yes very gloomy my friend	27.091992511864277
Someone had just died in the house to which that garden belonged	164.98828482215504
One of the persons whose conversation I overheard was the master of the house the other the physician	131.99783877433333
The former was confiding to the latter his grief and fear for it was the second time within a month that death had suddenly and unexpectedly entered that house which was apparently destined to destruction by some exterminating angel as an object of Gods anger	142.52791728584194
Ah indeed said Monte Cristo looking earnestly at the young man and by an imperceptible movement turning his chair so that he remained in the shade while the light fell full on Maximilians face	67.97706283971874
Yes continued Morrel death had entered that house twice within one month	247.54486621005412
And what did the doctor answer asked Monte Cristo	20.569316407902395
He repliedhe replied that the death was not a natural one and must be attributed	131.87219939793462
Indeed said Monte Cristo with a slight cough which in moments of extreme emotion helped him to disguise a blush or his pallor or the intense interest with which he listened indeed Maximilian did you hear that	133.78425090398756
Yes my dear count I heard it and the doctor added that if another death occurred in a similar way he must appeal to justice	135.94147707918853
Monte Cristo listened or appeared to do so with the greatest calmness	22.688588479474895
Well said Maximilian death came a third time and neither the master of the house nor the doctor said a word	55.47733458250165
Death is now perhaps striking a fourth blow	129.81769846025597
Count what am I bound to do being in possession of this secret	39.43529584533457
My dear friend said Monte Cristo you appear to be relating an adventure which we all know by heart	80.97053062204078
I know the house where you heard it or one very similar to it a house with a garden a master a physician and where there have been three unexpected and sudden deaths	156.31171586964075
Well I have not intercepted your confidence and yet I know all that as well as you and I have no conscientious scruples	62.10310430137966
No it does not concern me	2.646717955226127
You say an exterminating angel appears to have devoted that house to Gods angerwell who says your supposition is not reality Do not notice things which those whose interest it is to see them pass over	190.63287247296168
If it is Gods justice instead of his anger which is walking through that house Maximilian turn away your face and let his justice accomplish its purpose	179.29769230956708
There was something mournful solemn and terrible in the counts manner	36.423444186591176
Besides continued he in so changed a tone that no one would have supposed it was the same person speakingbesides who says that it will begin again	60.109082200968594
It has returned count exclaimed Morrel that is why I hastened to you	19.32937882002517
Well what do you wish me to do Do you wish me for instance to give information to the procureur Monte Cristo uttered the last words with so much meaning that Morrel starting up cried out	42.23063425224399
You know of whom I speak count do you not	24.361208301884858
Perfectly well my good friend and I will prove it to you by putting the dots to the i or rather by naming the persons	67.65692467263841
You were walking one evening in M	81.76314519577967
de Villeforts garden from what you relate I suppose it to have been the evening of Madame de SaintMrans death	35.71024701717491
dAvrigny about the death of M	34.51811835611855
de SaintMran and that no less surprising of the countess	103.96802052022957
dAvrigny said he believed they both proceeded from poison and you honest man have ever since been asking your heart and sounding your conscience to know if you ought to expose or conceal this secret	195.77915554536528
We are no longer in the Middle Ages there is no longer a Vehmgericht or Free Tribunals what do you want to ask these people Conscience what hast thou to do with me as Sterne said	149.73589663110803
My dear fellow let them sleep on if they are asleep let them grow pale in their drowsiness if they are disposed to do so and pray do you remain in peace who have no remorse to disturb you	80.90857742268724
Deep grief was depicted on Morrels features he seized Monte Cristos hand	92.64955271338404
But it is beginning again I say	41.729550233220834
Well said the Count astonished at his perseverance which he could not understand and looking still more earnestly at Maximilian let it begin againit is like the house of the Atreidae19 God has condemned them and they must submit to their punishment	137.97678610813978
They will all disappear like the fabrics children build with cards and which fall one by one under the breath of their builder even if there are two hundred of them	208.6811904112461
Three months since it was M	296.0370228721102
de SaintMran Madame de SaintMran two months since the other day it was Barrois today the old Noirtier or young Valentine	111.84126293481874
You knew it cried Morrel in such a paroxysm of terror that Monte Cristo startedhe whom the falling heavens would have found unmoved you knew it and said nothing	139.65623937848014
And what is it to me replied Monte Cristo shrugging his shoulders do I know those people and must I lose the one to save the other Faith no for between the culprit and the victim I have no choice	76.24492913550509
But I cried Morrel groaning with sorrow I love her	106.6978625032963
You lovewhom cried Monte Cristo starting to his feet and seizing the two hands which Morrel was raising towards heaven	41.042211243895416
I love most fondlyI love madlyI love as a man who would give his lifeblood to spare her a tearI love Valentine de Villefort who is being murdered at this moment Do you understand me I love her and I ask God and you how I can save her	73.96049265632178
Monte Cristo uttered a cry which those only can conceive who have heard the roar of a wounded lion	295.60224410327925
Unhappy man cried he wringing his hands in his turn you love Valentinethat daughter of an accursed race	112.39361839508797
Never had Morrel witnessed such an expressionnever had so terrible an eye flashed before his facenever had the genius of terror he had so often seen either on the battlefield or in the murderous nights of Algeria shaken around him more dreadful fire	145.70647184341152
As for Monte Cristo after this ebullition he closed his eyes as if dazzled by internal light	149.93398486655784
In a moment he restrained himself so powerfully that the tempestuous heaving of his breast subsided as turbulent and foaming waves yield to the suns genial influence when the cloud has passed	344.28024887252565
This silence selfcontrol and struggle lasted about twenty seconds then the count raised his pallid face	113.53480336014421
See said he my dear friend how God punishes the most thoughtless and unfeeling men for their indifference by presenting dreadful scenes to their view	301.93924826777817
I who was looking on an eager and curious spectatorI who was watching the working of this mournful tragedyI who like a wicked angel was laughing at the evil men committed protected by secrecy a secret is easily kept by the rich and powerful I am in my turn bitten by the serpent whose tortuous course I was watching and bitten to the heart	171.9625931198952
Come come continued the count complaints are unavailing be a man be strong be full of hope for I am here and will watch over you	145.64702711374846
Do you understand me cried Monte Cristo	3.935913607385374
Remember that I never uttered a falsehood and am never deceived	263.8978560784239
It is twelve oclock Maximilian thank heaven that you came at noon rather than in the evening or tomorrow morning	176.22916037042415
Listen Morrelit is noon if Valentine is not now dead she will not die	36.2342815899228
How so cried Morrel when I left her dying	51.43248960523784
Monte Cristo pressed his hands to his forehead	9.708886556448338
What was passing in that brain so loaded with dreadful secrets What does the angel of light or the angel of darkness say to that mind at once implacable and generous God only knows	217.77379262238895
Monte Cristo raised his head once more and this time he was calm as a child awaking from its sleep	113.63877440174015
I command you not to stirattempt nothing not to let your countenance betray a thought and I will send you tidings	264.2830977754708
Oh count you overwhelm me with that coolness	54.82852737571628
Have you then power against death Are you superhuman Are you an angel And the young man who had never shrunk from danger shrank before Monte Cristo with indescribable terror	111.43083593748413
But Monte Cristo looked at him with so melancholy and sweet a smile that Maximilian felt the tears filling his eyes	50.986666048732815
I can do much for you my friend replied the count	16.031344362304733
Morrel subdued by the extraordinary ascendancy Monte Cristo exercised over everything around him did not endeavor to resist it	125.83428474085113
He pressed the counts hand and left	19.513223097648858
He stopped one moment at the door for Baptistin whom he saw in the Rue Matignon and who was running	25.7074641849454
Meanwhile Villefort and dAvrigny had made all possible haste Valentine had not revived from her fainting fit on their arrival and the doctor examined the invalid with all the care the circumstances demanded and with an interest which the knowledge of the secret intensified twofold	147.47741284033592
Villefort closely watching his countenance and his lips awaited the result of the examination	38.46701784054509
Noirtier paler than even the young girl more eager than Villefort for the decision was watching also intently and affectionately	123.73881372192233
At last dAvrigny slowly uttered these words She is still alive	97.99774461433465
Still cried Villefort oh doctor what a dreadful word is that	39.93831770066339
Yes said the physician I repeat it she is still alive and I am astonished at it	48.30884004787166
But is she safe asked the father	26.09090808809214
At that moment dAvrignys glance met Noirtiers eye	631.1109204232455
It glistened with such extraordinary joy so rich and full of thought that the physician was struck	95.75142288003273
He placed the young girl again on the chairher lips were scarcely discernible they were so pale and white as well as her whole faceand remained motionless looking at Noirtier who appeared to anticipate and commend all he did	120.44663840609142
Sir said dAvrigny to Villefort call Mademoiselle Valentines maid if you please	230.05027794735645
Villefort went himself to find her and dAvrigny approached Noirtier	101.1117884198337
Have you something to tell me asked he	11.81207473156633
The old man winked his eyes expressively which we may remember was his only way of expressing his approval	303.5488350347697
Well I will remain with you	8.384061990350677
At this moment Villefort returned followed by the ladys maid and after her came Madame de Villefort	79.43905650823794
What is the matter then with this dear child she has just left me and she complained of being indisposed but I did not think seriously of it	92.63151089830708
The young woman with tears in her eyes and every mark of affection of a true mother approached Valentine and took her hand	56.22312956643896
DAvrigny continued to look at Noirtier he saw the eyes of the old man dilate and become round his cheeks turn pale and tremble the perspiration stood in drops upon his forehead	53.18051392166149
Ah said he involuntarily following Noirtiers eyes which were fixed on Madame de Villefort who repeated	21.080643166240943
This poor child would be better in bed	172.7092011273937
Come Fanny we will put her to bed	38.76805212701239
dAvrigny who saw that would be a means of his remaining alone with Noirtier expressed his opinion that it was the best thing that could be done but he forbade that anything should be given to her except what he ordered	73.27255718276858
They carried Valentine away she had revived but could scarcely move or speak so shaken was her frame by the attack	192.31512705473665
She had however just power to give one parting look to her grandfather who in losing her seemed to be resigning his very soul	144.30427462229346
DAvrigny followed the invalid wrote a prescription ordered Villefort to take a cabriolet go in person to a chemists to get the prescribed medicine bring it himself and wait for him in his daughters room	167.66264127439356
Then having renewed his injunction not to give Valentine anything he went down again to Noirtier shut the doors carefully and after convincing himself that no one was listening	102.17086597354852
Do you said he know anything of this young ladys illness	256.00381862647765
We have no time to lose I will question and do you answer me	52.403845576662135
Noirtier made a sign that he was ready to answer	17.950974839274174
Did you anticipate the accident which has happened to your granddaughter	36.52307453086525
DAvrigny reflected a moment then approaching Noirtier	490.9447033613666
Pardon what I am going to say added he but no indication should be neglected in this terrible situation	72.61654602529045
Did you see poor Barrois die Noirtier raised his eyes to heaven	22.988989242592083
Do you know of what he died asked dAvrigny placing his hand on Noirtiers shoulder	50.98264574445973
Do you think he died a natural death A sort of smile was discernible on the motionless lips of Noirtier	102.76421475647618
Then you have thought that Barrois was poisoned	474.35779246452563
Do you think the poison he fell a victim to was intended for him	137.56403045431884
Do you think the same hand which unintentionally struck Barrois has now attacked Valentine	752.6255646960127
Then will she die too asked dAvrigny fixing his penetrating gaze on Noirtier	51.48807086391677
He watched the effect of this question on the old man	28.978429617282515
No replied he with an air of triumph which would have puzzled the most clever diviner	94.99758501201057
Then you hope said dAvrigny with surprise	141.26586165689238
What do you hope The old man made him understand with his eyes that he could not answer	18.805477575934148
Ah yes it is true murmured dAvrigny	133.45438412170148
Then turning to NoirtierDo you hope the assassin will be tried	99.34306159710735
Then you hope the poison will take no effect on Valentine	51.8511592071247
It is no news to you added dAvrigny to tell you that an attempt has been made to poison her The old man made a sign that he entertained no doubt upon the subject	48.844005486972215
Then how do you hope Valentine will escape	45.9867506441629
Noirtier kept his eyes steadfastly fixed on the same spot	10.07715255991538
DAvrigny followed the direction and saw that they were fixed on a bottle containing the mixture which he took every morning	36.263865423732355
Ah indeed said dAvrigny struck with a sudden thought has it occurred to youNoirtier did not let him finish	117.7735840463784
To prepare her system to resist poison	1044.6273926810377
Yes yes yes said Noirtier delighted to be understood	165.1751655247474
I had told you that there was brucine in the mixture I give you	70.77041020395484
And by accustoming her to that poison you have endeavored to neutralize the effect of a similar poison Noirtiers joy continued	182.31447818554076
And you have succeeded exclaimed dAvrigny	40.01131360845247
Without that precaution Valentine would have died before assistance could have been procured	109.41594554089801
The dose has been excessive but she has only been shaken by it and this time at any rate Valentine will not die	59.84610265860518
A superhuman joy expanded the old mans eyes which were raised towards heaven with an expression of infinite gratitude	14.40013773416669
Here doctor said he is what you sent me for	31.800042479481203
Was this prepared in your presence	94.37268725437254
Have you not let it go out of your hands	28.34254203001918
DAvrigny took the bottle poured some drops of the mixture it contained in the hollow of his hand and swallowed them	36.96469376490841
Well said he let us go to Valentine I will give instructions to everyone and you M	59.51049081111994
de Villefort will yourself see that no one deviates from them	100.958257780795
At the moment when dAvrigny was returning to Valentines room accompanied by Villefort an Italian priest of serious demeanor and calm and firm tone hired for his use the house adjoining the hotel of M	113.61208740948845
No one knew how the three former tenants of that house left it	234.98794452787493
About two hours afterwards its foundation was reported to be unsafe but the report did not prevent the new occupant establishing himself there with his modest furniture the same day at five oclock	127.38146912564027
The lease was drawn up for three six or nine years by the new tenant who according to the rule of the proprietor paid six months in advance	60.35996316666666
This new tenant who as we have said was an Italian was called Il Signor Giacomo Busoni	103.19260425946368
Workmen were immediately called in and that same night the passengers at the end of the faubourg saw with surprise that carpenters and masons were occupied in repairing the lower part of the tottering house	169.09701131214405
We saw in a preceding chapter how Madame Danglars went formally to announce to Madame de Villefort the approaching marriage of Eugnie Danglars and M	92.9156113504359
This formal announcement which implied or appeared to imply the approval of all the persons concerned in this momentous affair had been preceded by a scene to which our readers must be admitted	97.14317130735309
We beg them to take one step backward and to transport themselves the morning of that day of great catastrophes into the showy gilded salon we have before shown them and which was the pride of its owner Baron Danglars	181.56429958586358
In this room at about ten oclock in the morning the banker himself had been walking to and fro for some minutes thoughtfully and in evident uneasiness watching both doors and listening to every sound	70.90709597780238
When his patience was exhausted he called his valet	37.67738884705969
tienne said he see why Mademoiselle Eugnie has asked me to meet her in the drawingroom and why she makes me wait so long	43.9270612142065
Having given this vent to his illhumor the baron became more calm Mademoiselle Danglars had that morning requested an interview with her father and had fixed on the gilded drawingroom as the spot	112.62400262993427
The singularity of this step and above all its formality had not a little surprised the banker who had immediately obeyed his daughter by repairing first to the drawingroom	112.2725959325107
tienne soon returned from his errand	2120.5110162775172
Mademoiselles ladys maid says sir that mademoiselle is finishing her toilette and will be here shortly	348.0177901541187
Danglars nodded to signify that he was satisfied	20.889400354385472
To the world and to his servants Danglars assumed the character of the goodnatured man and the indulgent father	136.4801696836108
This was one of his parts in the popular comedy he was performinga makeup he had adopted and which suited him about as well as the masks worn on the classic stage by paternal actors who seen from one side were the image of geniality and from the other showed lips drawn down in chronic illtemper	272.6258703250626
Let us hasten to say that in private the genial side descended to the level of the other so that generally the indulgent man disappeared to give place to the brutal husband and domineering father	185.31807871010807
Why the devil does that foolish girl who pretends to wish to speak to me not come into my study and why on earth does she want to speak to me at all	58.06267934621915
He was turning this thought over in his brain for the twentieth time when the door opened and Eugnie appeared attired in a figured black satin dress her hair dressed and gloves on as if she were going to the Italian Opera	58.50809110758527
Well Eugnie what is it you want with me and why in this solemn drawingroom when the study is so comfortable	99.2807795942832
I quite understand why you ask sir said Eugnie making a sign that her father might be seated and in fact your two questions suggest fully the theme of our conversation	130.04339243871095
I will answer them both and contrary to the usual method the last first because it is the least difficult	119.33194462905769
I have chosen the drawingroom sir as our place of meeting in order to avoid the disagreeable impressions and influences of a bankers study	130.88187763631169
Those gilded cashbooks drawers locked like gates of fortresses heaps of bankbills come from I know not where and the quantities of letters from England Holland Spain India China and Peru have generally a strange influence on a fathers mind and make him forget that there is in the world an interest greater and more sacred than the good opinion of his correspondents	171.47186443563587
I have therefore chosen this drawingroom where you see smiling and happy in their magnificent frames your portrait mine my mothers and all sorts of rural landscapes and touching pastorals	415.7073907218036
I rely much on external impressions perhaps with regard to you they are immaterial but I should be no artist if I had not some fancies	122.41301033512843
Danglars who had listened to all this preamble with imperturbable coolness but without understanding a word since like every man burdened with thoughts of the past he was occupied with seeking the thread of his own ideas in those of the speaker	125.459049338858
There is then the second point cleared up or nearly so said Eugnie without the least confusion and with that masculine pointedness which distinguished her gesture and her language and you appear satisfied with the explanation	251.93600831722426
Now let us return to the first	33.23601361960296
You ask me why I have requested this interview I will tell you in two words sir I will not marry count Andrea Cavalcanti	56.65999473685149
Danglars leaped from his chair and raised his eyes and arms towards heaven	15.556830963017395
Yes indeed sir continued Eugnie still quite calm you are astonished I see for since this little affair began I have not manifested the slightest opposition and yet I am always sure when the opportunity arrives to oppose a determined and absolute will to people who have not consulted me and things which displease me	171.2315712308138
However this time my tranquillity or passiveness as philosophers say proceeded from another source it proceeded from a wish like a submissive and devoted daughter a slight smile was observable on the purple lips of the young girl to practice obedience	169.94120928294328
Well sir replied Eugnie I have tried to the very last and now that the moment has come I feel in spite of all my efforts that it is impossible	48.217687438468914
But said Danglars whose weak mind was at first quite overwhelmed with the weight of this pitiless logic marking evident premeditation and force of will what is your reason for this refusal Eugnie what reason do you assign	297.3232490742317
My reason replied the young girl	2.342210356645212
Well it is not that the man is more ugly more foolish or more disagreeable than any other no M	110.28751245432638
Andrea Cavalcanti may appear to those who look at mens faces and figures as a very good specimen of his kind	126.65057207435382
It is not either that my heart is less touched by him than any other that would be a schoolgirls reason which I consider quite beneath me	103.4803415496904
I actually love no one sir you know it do you not I do not then see why without real necessity I should encumber my life with a perpetual companion	99.95743961840667
Has not some sage said Nothing too much and another I carry all my effects with me I have been taught these two aphorisms in Latin and in Greek one is I believe from Phdrus and the other from Bias	177.90218154546696
Well my dear father in the shipwreck of lifefor life is an eternal shipwreck of our hopesI cast into the sea my useless encumbrance that is all and I remain with my own will disposed to live perfectly alone and consequently perfectly free	203.41511666417176
Unhappy girl unhappy girl murmured Danglars turning pale for he knew from long experience the solidity of the obstacle he had so suddenly encountered	160.90012408182918
Unhappy girl replied Eugnie unhappy girl do you say sir No indeed the exclamation appears quite theatrical and affected	136.87523450262867
Happy on the contrary for what am I in want of The world calls me beautiful	133.9895339031714
It is something to be well received	583.8429384760943
I like a favorable reception it expands the countenance and those around me do not then appear so ugly	172.08587844582792
I possess a share of wit and a certain relative sensibility which enables me to draw from life in general for the support of mine all I meet with that is good like the monkey who cracks the nut to get at its contents	153.1273430501624
I am rich for you have one of the first fortunes in France	36.17628221542267
I am your only daughter and you are not so exacting as the fathers of the Porte SaintMartin and Gat who disinherit their daughters for not giving them grandchildren	148.72373967949432
Besides the provident law has deprived you of the power to disinherit me at least entirely as it has also of the power to compel me to marry Monsieur This or Monsieur That	124.622779427423
And sobeing beautiful witty somewhat talented as the comic operas say and richand that is happiness sirwhy do you call me unhappy	516.6626701829128
Danglars seeing his daughter smiling and proud even to insolence could not entirely repress his brutal feelings but they betrayed themselves only by an exclamation	258.534760565756
Under the fixed and inquiring gaze levelled at him from under those beautiful black eyebrows he prudently turned away and calmed himself immediately daunted by the power of a resolute mind	260.80647634039326
Truly my daughter replied he with a smile you are all you boast of being excepting one thing I will not too hastily tell you which but would rather leave you to guess it	96.74750629094835
Eugnie looked at Danglars much surprised that one flower of her crown of pride with which she had so superbly decked herself should be disputed	224.690887773704
My daughter continued the banker you have perfectly explained to me the sentiments which influence a girl like you who is determined she will not marry now it remains for me to tell you the motives of a father like me who has decided that his daughter shall marry	64.02611566701937
Eugnie bowed not as a submissive daughter but as an adversary prepared for a discussion	163.80901244686297
My daughter continued Danglars when a father asks his daughter to choose a husband he has always some reason for wishing her to marry	138.14000655148996
Some are affected with the mania of which you spoke just now that of living again in their grandchildren	107.87709378722197
This is not my weakness I tell you at once family joys have no charm for me	169.56006574844844
I may acknowledge this to a daughter whom I know to be philosophical enough to understand my indifference and not to impute it to me as a crime	76.76973488818497
This is not to the purpose said Eugnie let us speak candidly sir I admire candor	102.44261590651871
Oh said Danglars I can when circumstances render it desirable adopt your system although it may not be my general practice	570.2482385648276
I have proposed to you to marry not for your sake for indeed I did not think of you in the least at the moment you admire candor and will now be satisfied I hope but because it suited me to marry you as soon as possible on account of certain commercial speculations I am desirous of entering into	58.034335820335635
It is just as I tell you I assure you and you must not be angry with me for you have sought this disclosure	28.227363700252187
I do not willingly enter into arithmetical explanations with an artist like you who fears to enter my study lest she should imbibe disagreeable or antipoetic impressions and sensations	349.78830436785955
But in that same bankers study where you very willingly presented yourself yesterday to ask for the thousand francs I give you monthly for pocketmoney you must know my dear young lady that many things may be learned useful even to a girl who will not marry	107.56655346003787
There one may learn for instance what out of regard to your nervous susceptibility I will inform you of in the drawingroom namely that the credit of a banker is his physical and moral life that credit sustains him as breath animates the body and M	203.47233034782127
de Monte Cristo once gave me a lecture on that subject which I have never forgotten	67.11844567770387
There we may learn that as credit sinks the body becomes a corpse and this is what must happen very soon to the banker who is proud to own so good a logician as you for his daughter	115.90231952309884
But Eugnie instead of stooping drew herself up under the blow	133.78860860570808
Exactly my daughter that is precisely what I mean said Danglars almost digging his nails into his breast while he preserved on his harsh features the smile of the heartless though clever man ruinedyes that is it	133.63715600813507
Yes ruined Now it is revealed this secret so full of horror as the tragic poet says	170.95882255458258
Now my daughter learn from my lips how you may alleviate this misfortune so far as it will affect you	57.69510944487163
Oh cried Eugnie you are a bad physiognomist if you imagine I deplore on my own account the catastrophe of which you warn me	89.5173629056159
I ruined and what will that signify to me Have I not my talent left Can I not like Pasta Malibran Grisi acquire for myself what you would never have given me whatever might have been your fortune a hundred or a hundred and fifty thousand livres per annum for which I shall be indebted to no one but myself and which instead of being given as you gave me those poor twelve thousand francs with sour looks and reproaches for my prodigality will be accompanied with acclamations with bravos and with flowers And if I do not possess that talent which your smiles prove to me you doubt should I not still have that ardent love of independence which will be a substitute for wealth and which in my mind supersedes even the instinct of selfpreservation No I grieve not on my own account I shall always find a resource my books my pencils my piano all the things which cost but little and which I shall be able to procure will remain my own	113.9529561626005
Do you think that I sorrow for Madame Danglars Undeceive yourself again either I am greatly mistaken or she has provided against the catastrophe which threatens you and which will pass over without affecting her	248.55041634802566
She has taken care for herselfat least I hope sofor her attention has not been diverted from her projects by watching over me	324.4836572661774
She has fostered my independence by professedly indulging my love for liberty	614.3287553585178
Oh no sir from my childhood I have seen too much and understood too much of what has passed around me for misfortune to have an undue power over me	63.843927914350836
From my earliest recollections I have been beloved by no oneso much the worse that has naturally led me to love no oneso much the betternow you have my profession of faith	200.77089566129527
Then said Danglars pale with anger which was not at all due to offended paternal lovethen mademoiselle you persist in your determination to accelerate my ruin	248.69778662826357
Your ruin I accelerate your ruin What do you mean I do not understand you	15.612807477026417
So much the better I have a ray of hope left listen	93.36714773807294
I am all attention said Eugnie looking so earnestly at her father that it was an effort for the latter to endure her unrelenting gaze	94.2755336118232
Cavalcanti continued Danglars is about to marry you and will place in my hands his fortune amounting to three million livres	62.851173158488194
That is admirable said Eugnie with sovereign contempt smoothing her gloves out one upon the other	266.8683210089549
You think I shall deprive you of those three millions said Danglars but do not fear it	22.666026261571066
They are destined to produce at least ten	28.727686952412775
I and a brother banker have obtained a grant of a railway the only industrial enterprise which in these days promises to make good the fabulous prospects that Law once held out to the eternally deluded Parisians in the fantastic Mississippi scheme	460.08203727919374
As I look at it a millionth part of a railway is worth fully as much as an acre of waste land on the banks of the Ohio	119.02639893623527
We make in our case a deposit on a mortgage which is an advance as you see since we gain at least ten fifteen twenty or a hundred livres worth of iron in exchange for our money	96.81614034758306
Well within a week I am to deposit four millions for my share the four millions I promise you will produce ten or twelve	63.18715749758844
But during my visit to you the day before yesterday sir which you appear to recollect so well replied Eugnie I saw you arranging a depositis not that the termof five millions and a half you even pointed it out to me in two drafts on the treasury and you were astonished that so valuable a paper did not dazzle my eyes like lightning	130.36093880408038
Yes but those five millions and a half are not mine and are only a proof of the great confidence placed in me my title of popular banker has gained me the confidence of charitable institutions and the five millions and a half belong to them at any other time I should not have hesitated to make use of them but the great losses I have recently sustained are well known and as I told you my credit is rather shaken	92.91686677458007
That deposit may be at any moment withdrawn and if I had employed it for another purpose I should bring on me a disgraceful bankruptcy	110.38124690792324
I do not despise bankruptcies believe me but they must be those which enrich not those which ruin	271.35150808606727
Cavalcanti and I get the three millions or even if it is thought I am going to get them my credit will be restored and my fortune which for the last month or two has been swallowed up in gulfs which have been opened in my path by an inconceivable fatality will revive	73.99928510976007
Perfectly you pledge me for three millions do you not	16.881620460711144
The greater the amount the more flattering it is to you it gives you an idea of your value	93.04483799824656
One word more sir do you promise me to make what use you can of the report of the fortune M	47.583771371203795
Cavalcanti will bring without touching the money This is no act of selfishness but of delicacy	119.77725025000846
I am willing to help rebuild your fortune but I will not be an accomplice in the ruin of others	52.475556236236606
But since I tell you cried Danglars that with these three million	152.04666749689696
Do you expect to recover your position sir without touching those three million	167.9274776957608
I hope so if the marriage should take place and confirm my credit	90.1114333187282
Shall you be able to pay M	97.99581925381929
Cavalcanti the five hundred thousand francs you promise for my dowry	59.554564121280876
He shall receive them on returning from the mayors20	361.5876734450556
What next what more do you want	5.3923669761589865
I wish to know if in demanding my signature you leave me entirely free in my person	181.29042240533155
Then as I said before sirvery well I am ready to marry M	99.44561146698682
But what are you up to	7.690750092773187
What advantage should I have over you if knowing your secret I were to tell you mine	223.45269019357454
Then said he you are ready to pay the official visits which are absolutely indispensable	162.34061754388352
And to sign the contract in three days	35.20088824086515
Then in my turn I also say very well	106.92533884825743
Danglars pressed his daughters hand in his	12.501005106633254
But extraordinary to relate the father did not say Thank you my child nor did the daughter smile at her father	123.11208365086947
Is the conference ended asked Eugnie rising	150.6221049921653
Danglars motioned that he had nothing more to say	43.69251983381703
Five minutes afterwards the piano resounded to the touch of Mademoiselle dArmillys fingers and Mademoiselle Danglars was singing Brabantios malediction on Desdemona	524.4638069733425
At the end of the piece tienne entered and announced to Eugnie that the horses were to the carriage and that the baroness was waiting for her to pay her visits	83.20860347557496
We have seen them at Villeforts they proceeded then on their course	334.6727533728144
Three days after the scene we have just described namely towards five oclock in the afternoon of the day fixed for the signature of the contract between Mademoiselle Eugnie Danglars and Andrea Cavalcanti whom the banker persisted in calling prince a fresh breeze was stirring the leaves in the little garden in front of the Count of Monte Cristos house and the count was preparing to go out	55.24821175962471
While his horses were impatiently pawing the ground held in by the coachman who had been seated a quarter of an hour on his box the elegant phaeton with which we are familiar rapidly turned the angle of the entrancegate and cast out on the doorsteps M	90.08467160713597
Andrea Cavalcanti as decked up and gay as if he were going to marry a princess	33.22251534456044
He inquired after the count with his usual familiarity and ascending lightly to the first story met him at the top of the stairs	42.42132086471973
The count stopped on seeing the young man	5.565327228384183
As for Andrea he was launched and when he was once launched nothing stopped him	282.94306541214786
Ah good morning my dear count said he	6.041484189081376
Andrea said the latter with his halfjesting tone how do you do	131.29956175187704
I am come to talk to you about a thousand things but first tell me were you going out or just returned	90.15457590072486
Then in order not to hinder you I will get up with you if you please in your carriage and Tom shall follow with my phaeton in tow	120.12142021574988
No said the count with an imperceptible smile of contempt for he had no wish to be seen in the young mans societyno I prefer listening to you here my dear M	41.98278136752684
Andrea we can chat better indoors and there is no coachman to overhear our conversation	203.9044979114954
The count returned to a small drawingroom on the first floor sat down and crossing his legs motioned to the young man to take a seat also	39.75908040999156
You know my dear count said he the ceremony is to take place this evening	30.437149521128134
At nine oclock the contract is to be signed at my fatherinlaws	83.0519903995517
What is it news to you Has not M	246.14847822738514
Danglars informed you of the ceremony	1704.4798051223572
Oh yes said the count I received a letter from him yesterday but I do not think the hour was mentioned	53.09454152500469
Possibly my fatherinlaw trusted to its general notoriety	2735.818234777609
Well said Monte Cristo you are fortunate M	60.90299875344602
Cavalcanti it is a most suitable alliance you are contracting and Mademoiselle Danglars is a handsome girl	105.32515855879392
Yes indeed she is replied Cavalcanti in a very modest tone	39.44360073912984
Above all she is very richat least I believe so said Monte Cristo	75.02322924332364
Very rich do you think replied the young man	12.461387968628163
Danglars conceals at least half of his fortune	22.795053521631605
And he acknowledges fifteen or twenty millions said Andrea with a look sparkling with joy	38.047706951505226
Without reckoning added Monte Cristo that he is on the eve of entering into a sort of speculation already in vogue in the United States and in England but quite novel in France	100.34405535906204
Yes yes I know what you meanthe railway of which he has obtained the grant is it not	162.11340034479667
Precisely it is generally believed he will gain ten millions by that affair	77.3794366044687
Ten millions Do you think so It is magnificent said Cavalcanti who was quite confounded at the metallic sound of these golden words	107.9374055957221
Without reckoning replied Monte Cristo that all his fortune will come to you and justly too since Mademoiselle Danglars is an only daughter	76.15890642350686
Besides your own fortune as your father assured me is almost equal to that of your betrothed	58.97815631621222
Andrea I think you have managed this affair rather skilfully	844.2086640704943
Not badly by any means said the young man I was born for a diplomatist	40.69090445852063
Well you must become a diplomatist diplomacy you know is something that is not to be acquired it is instinctive	117.20420136111555
Indeed I fear it replied Andrea in the tone in which he had heard Dorante or Valre reply to Alceste21 at the Thtre Franais	194.78409098461213
I suppose so said Andrea with a triumphant smile since I am accepted	44.854588265540784
But I must not forget one grand point	1324.1074483981931
That I have been singularly assisted	17039.784608772155
By me Not at all prince said Monte Cristo laying a marked stress on the title what have I done for you Are not your name your social position and your merit sufficient	126.94046718189746
No said Andreano it is useless for you to say so count	58.5644682238231
I maintain that the position of a man like you has done more than my name my social position and my merit	50.489788383078626
You are completely mistaken sir said Monte Cristo coldly who felt the perfidious manuvre of the young man and understood the bearing of his words you only acquired my protection after the influence and fortune of your father had been ascertained for after all who procured for me who had never seen either you or your illustrious father the pleasure of your acquaintancetwo of my good friends Lord Wilmore and the Abb Busoni	74.74452774759801
What encouraged me not to become your surety but to patronize youyour fathers name so well known in Italy and so highly honored	203.32553508055716
Personally I do not know you	27.375188383503296
This calm tone and perfect ease made Andrea feel that he was for the moment restrained by a more muscular hand than his own and that the restraint could not be easily broken through	99.44799627307619
Oh then my father has really a very large fortune count	313.5903403765976
It appears so sir replied Monte Cristo	1.4265659653057958
Do you know if the marriage settlement he promised me has come	210.01196276669944
I have been advised of it	17.10423992634366
The three millions are probably on the road	17.713244898694242
Then I shall really have them	219.7044951619587
Oh well said the count I do not think you have yet known the want of money	29.539288967813192
Andrea was so surprised that he pondered the matter for a moment	84.70263602427994
Now sir I have one request to make to you which you will understand even if it should be disagreeable to you	45.86704635656645
I have formed an acquaintance thanks to my good fortune with many noted persons and have at least for the moment a crowd of friends	105.22388321287066
But marrying as I am about to do before all Paris I ought to be supported by an illustrious name and in the absence of the paternal hand some powerful one ought to lead me to the altar now my father is not coming to Paris is he	56.14403547821725
He is old covered with wounds and suffers dreadfully he says in travelling	391.74978377195356
I understand well I am come to ask a favor of you	27.544302105419245
And pray what may it be	7.071033470899597
Ah my dear sir Whatafter the varied relations I have had the happiness to sustain towards you can it be that you know me so little as to ask such a thing Ask me to lend you half a million and although such a loan is somewhat rare on my honor you would annoy me less Know then what I thought I had already told you that in participation in this worlds affairs more especially in their moral aspects the Count of Monte Cristo has never ceased to entertain the scruples and even the superstitions of the East	81.72711112184318
I who have a seraglio at Cairo one at Smyrna and one at Constantinople preside at a weddingnever	423.6560582664485
Decidedly and were you my son or my brother I would refuse you in the same way	30.569298007352867
But what must be done said Andrea disappointed	136.38078879235104
You said just now that you had a hundred friends	48.82500263948011
Very true but you introduced me at M	38.4601453656276
Not at all Let us recall the exact facts	508.2584065804835
You met him at a dinner party at my house and you introduced yourself at his house that is a totally different affair	92.6714869028283
Yes but by my marriage you have forwarded that	193.8401374468208
Inot in the least I beg you to believe	29.292084887843284
Recollect what I told you when you asked me to propose you	29.608856198823627
Oh I never make matches my dear prince it is my settled principle	133.97585135994527
But at least you will be there	40.7127349765248
Well like all Paris I shall be there too said the count	18.017613694546803
And will you sign the contract	35.59598895314076
I see no objection to that my scruples do not go thus far	136.62187125852543
Well since you will grant me no more I must be content with what you give me	31.90289081300904
Be careful advice is worse than a service	25.24573939322474
Oh you can give me this without compromising yourself	252.40026257475617
Is my wifes fortune five hundred thousand livres	6.636865020074154
Must I receive it or leave it in the hands of the notary	25.08783508630826
This is the way such affairs are generally arranged when it is wished to do them stylishly Your two solicitors appoint a meeting when the contract is signed for the next or the following day then they exchange the two portions for which they each give a receipt then when the marriage is celebrated they place the amount at your disposal as the chief member of the alliance	178.51620694556513
Because said Andrea with a certain illconcealed uneasiness I thought I heard my fatherinlaw say that he intended embarking our property in that famous railway affair of which you spoke just now	148.1886240773948
Well replied Monte Cristo it will be the way everybody says of trebling your fortune in twelve months	128.17382979700642
Baron Danglars is a good father and knows how to calculate	147.69693640237338
In that case said Andrea everything is all right excepting your refusal which quite grieves me	270.82026851276197
You must attribute it only to natural scruples under similar circumstances	1288.3713283705258
Well said Andrea let it be as you wish	35.403448724950614
This evening then at nine oclock	1.0589735509268816
Notwithstanding a slight resistance on the part of Monte Cristo whose lips turned pale but who preserved his ceremonious smile Andrea seized the counts hand pressed it jumped into his phaeton and disappeared	49.903880904013405
The four or five remaining hours before nine oclock arrived Andrea employed in riding paying visitsdesigned to induce those of whom he had spoken to appear at the bankers in their gayest equipagesdazzling them by promises of shares in schemes which have since turned every brain and in which Danglars was just taking the initiative	241.75417100187096
In fact at halfpast eight in the evening the grand salon the gallery adjoining and the three other drawingrooms on the same floor were filled with a perfumed crowd who sympathized but little in the event but who all participated in that love of being present wherever there is anything fresh to be seen	110.87866808677339
An Academician would say that the entertainments of the fashionable world are collections of flowers which attract inconstant butterflies famished bees and buzzing drones	753.4507356990295
No one could deny that the rooms were splendidly illuminated the light streamed forth on the gilt mouldings and the silk hangings and all the bad taste of decorations which had only their richness to boast of shone in its splendor	155.03985251973495
Mademoiselle Eugnie was dressed with elegant simplicity in a figured white silk dress and a white rose half concealed in her jet black hair was her only ornament unaccompanied by a single jewel	157.0083312138467
Her eyes however betrayed that perfect confidence which contradicted the girlish simplicity of this modest attire	358.58491707687546
Madame Danglars was chatting at a short distance with Debray Beauchamp and ChteauRenaud	34.65958798382075
Debray was admitted to the house for this grand ceremony but on the same plane with everyone else and without any particular privilege	148.34979612567
Danglars surrounded by deputies and men connected with the revenue was explaining a new theory of taxation which he intended to adopt when the course of events had compelled the government to call him into the ministry	128.72139481592907
Andrea on whose arm hung one of the most consummate dandies of the Opera was explaining to him rather cleverly since he was obliged to be bold to appear at ease his future projects and the new luxuries he meant to introduce to Parisian fashions with his hundred and seventyfive thousand livres per annum	132.42031912162994
The crowd moved to and fro in the rooms like an ebb and flow of turquoises rubies emeralds opals and diamonds	155.4352509954516
As usual the oldest women were the most decorated and the ugliest the most conspicuous	169.49742325773136
If there was a beautiful lily or a sweet rose you had to search for it concealed in some corner behind a mother with a turban or an aunt with a birdofparadise	212.20318994358445
At each moment in the midst of the crowd the buzzing and the laughter the doorkeepers voice was heard announcing some name well known in the financial department respected in the army or illustrious in the literary world and which was acknowledged by a slight movement in the different groups	134.02316407662488
But for one whose privilege it was to agitate that ocean of human waves how many were received with a look of indifference or a sneer of disdain	133.37763108553645
At the moment when the hand of the massive timepiece representing Endymion asleep pointed to nine on its golden face and the hammer the faithful type of mechanical thought struck nine times the name of the Count of Monte Cristo resounded in its turn and as if by an electric shock all the assembly turned towards the door	102.02551436601168
The count was dressed in black and with his habitual simplicity his white waistcoat displayed his expansive noble chest and his black stock was singularly noticeable because of its contrast with the deadly paleness of his face	109.4490952603024
His only jewellery was a chain so fine that the slender gold thread was scarcely perceptible on his white waistcoat	189.92841966534886
A circle was immediately formed around the door	17.79870451450823
The count perceived at one glance Madame Danglars at one end of the drawingroom M	39.18838086014424
Danglars at the other and Eugnie in front of him	62.4141794168892
He first advanced towards the baroness who was chatting with Madame de Villefort who had come alone Valentine being still an invalid and without turning aside so clear was the road left for him he passed from the baroness to Eugnie whom he complimented in such rapid and measured terms that the proud artist was quite struck	111.16441444327383
Near her was Mademoiselle Louise dArmilly who thanked the count for the letters of introduction he had so kindly given her for Italy which she intended immediately to make use of	54.32859767332806
On leaving these ladies he found himself with Danglars who had advanced to meet him	21.423601311049584
Having accomplished these three social duties Monte Cristo stopped looking around him with that expression peculiar to a certain class which seems to say I have done my duty now let others do theirs	102.29573013759222
Andrea who was in an adjoining room had shared in the sensation caused by the arrival of Monte Cristo and now came forward to pay his respects to the count	28.299363356448055
He found him completely surrounded all were eager to speak to him as is always the case with those whose words are few and weighty	103.45808885136901
The solicitors arrived at this moment and arranged their scrawled papers on the velvet cloth embroidered with gold which covered the table prepared for the signature it was a gilt table supported on lions claws	111.79914794379265
One of the notaries sat down the other remained standing	31.659207127014373
They were about to proceed to the reading of the contract which half Paris assembled was to sign	122.96372143319566
All took their places or rather the ladies formed a circle while the gentlemen more indifferent to the restraints of what Boileau calls the style nergique commented on the feverish agitation of Andrea on M	250.8403335441791
Danglars riveted attention Eugnies composure and the light and sprightly manner in which the baroness treated this important affair	159.14448936696067
The contract was read during a profound silence	47.21735149934516
But as soon as it was finished the buzz was redoubled through all the drawingrooms the brilliant sums the rolling millions which were to be at the command of the two young people and which crowned the display of the wedding presents and the young ladys diamonds which had been made in a room entirely appropriated for that purpose had exercised to the full their delusions over the envious assembly	141.47383830058862
Mademoiselle Danglars charms were heightened in the opinion of the young men and for the moment seemed to outvie the sun in splendor	46.435213940465914
As for the ladies it is needless to say that while they coveted the millions they thought they did not need them for themselves as they were beautiful enough without them	122.28902420257728
Andrea surrounded by his friends complimented flattered beginning to believe in the reality of his dream was almost bewildered	252.84173423159262
The notary solemnly took the pen flourished it above his head and said	61.65068766830091
Gentlemen we are about to sign the contract	36.37403305992742
The baron was to sign first then the representative of M	100.16299586668814
Cavalcanti senior then the baroness afterwards the future couple as they are styled in the abominable phraseology of legal documents	356.9670490417108
The baron took the pen and signed then the representative	115.66759863735489
The baroness approached leaning on Madame de Villeforts arm	16.335193013885306
My dear said she as she took the pen is it not vexatious An unexpected incident in the affair of murder and theft at the Count of Monte Cristos in which he nearly fell a victim deprives us of the pleasure of seeing M	116.10697179126774
Danglars in the same tone in which he would have said Oh well what do I care	25.89493999283546
As a matter of fact said Monte Cristo approaching I am much afraid that I am the involuntary cause of his absence	45.6206019879244
What you count said Madame Danglars signing if you are take care for I shall never forgive you	67.14025871257557
But it is not my fault as I shall endeavor to prove	28.28895886895019
Everyone listened eagerly Monte Cristo who so rarely opened his lips was about to speak	36.20052340841641
You remember said the count during the most profound silence that the unhappy wretch who came to rob me died at my house the supposition is that he was stabbed by his accomplice on attempting to leave it	81.27028259605314
In order that his wounds might be examined he was undressed and his clothes were thrown into a corner where the police picked them up with the exception of the waistcoat which they overlooked	86.30798975831762
Andrea turned pale and drew towards the door he saw a cloud rising in the horizon which appeared to forebode a coming storm	70.11592790635703
Well this waistcoat was discovered today covered with blood and with a hole over the heart	69.15186594359685
The ladies screamed and two or three prepared to faint	62.625986419323816
No one could guess what the dirty rag could be I alone suspected that it was the waistcoat of the murdered man	171.27365340528996
My valet in examining this mournful relic felt a paper in the pocket and drew it out it was a letter addressed to you baron	82.3740190970654
Yes indeed to you I succeeded in deciphering your name under the blood with which the letter was stained replied Monte Cristo amid the general outburst of amazement	127.96778915047824
But asked Madame Danglars looking at her husband with uneasiness how could that prevent M	90.9971074879761
In this simple way madame replied Monte Cristo the waistcoat and the letter were both what is termed circumstantial evidence I therefore sent them to the kings attorney	113.08581498205108
You understand my dear baron that legal methods are the safest in criminal cases it was perhaps some plot against you	274.73822806758375
Andrea looked steadily at Monte Cristo and disappeared in the second drawingroom	32.07647161553389
Possibly said Danglars was not this murdered man an old galleyslave	525.3571093286329
Yes replied the count a felon named Caderousse	676.7878298518214
Danglars turned slightly pale Andrea reached the anteroom beyond the little drawingroom	150.01012582903394
But go on signing said Monte Cristo I perceive that my story has caused a general emotion and I beg to apologize to you baroness and to Mademoiselle Danglars	62.218126971688164
The baroness who had signed returned the pen to the notary	50.55522575344014
Prince Cavalcanti said the latter Prince Cavalcanti where are you	122.32500062209049
Andrea Andrea repeated several young people who were already on sufficiently intimate terms with him to call him by his Christian name	86.70240519135805
Call the prince inform him that it is his turn to sign cried Danglars to one of the floorkeepers	62.26873973186777
But at the same instant the crowd of guests rushed in alarm into the principal salon as if some frightful monster had entered the apartments qurens quem devoret	281.98314349465136
There was indeed reason to retreat to be alarmed and to scream	244.3911458546153
An officer was placing two soldiers at the door of each drawingroom and was advancing towards Danglars preceded by a commissary of police girded with his scarf	54.681006606664816
Madame Danglars uttered a scream and fainted	197.12147287383442
Danglars who thought himself threatened certain consciences are never calmDanglars even before his guests showed a countenance of abject terror	762.7340448049787
What is the matter sir asked Monte Cristo advancing to meet the commissioner	21.74931329152915
Which of you gentlemen asked the magistrate without replying to the count answers to the name of Andrea Cavalcanti	53.5030715044672
A cry of astonishment was heard from all parts of the room	18.949946603017327
But who then is Andrea Cavalcanti asked Danglars in amazement	60.50437539397732
A galleyslave escaped from confinement at Toulon	135.92417801242436
And what crime has he committed	908.885084120807
He is accused said the commissary with his inflexible voice of having assassinated the man named Caderousse his former companion in prison at the moment he was making his escape from the house of the Count of Monte Cristo	43.65607761831215
Monte Cristo cast a rapid glance around him	1.735533106328788
A few minutes after the scene of confusion produced in the salons of M	53.2316789303451
Danglars by the unexpected appearance of the brigade of soldiers and by the disclosure which had followed the mansion was deserted with as much rapidity as if a case of plague or of cholera morbus had broken out among the guests	105.08270469099637
In a few minutes through all the doors down all the staircases by every exit everyone hastened to retire or rather to fly for it was a situation where the ordinary condolenceswhich even the best friends are so eager to offer in great catastropheswere seen to be utterly futile	205.3698892990426
There remained in the bankers house only Danglars closeted in his study and making his statement to the officer of gendarmes Madame Danglars terrified in the boudoir with which we are acquainted and Eugnie who with haughty air and disdainful lip had retired to her room with her inseparable companion Mademoiselle Louise dArmilly	98.1600017765174
As for the numerous servants more numerous that evening than usual for their number was augmented by cooks and butlers from the Caf de Paris venting on their employers their anger at what they termed the insult to which they had been subjected they collected in groups in the hall in the kitchens or in their rooms thinking very little of their duty which was thus naturally interrupted	166.374963629108
Of all this household only two persons deserve our notice these are Mademoiselle Eugnie Danglars and Mademoiselle Louise dArmilly	132.93813356255933
The betrothed had retired as we said with haughty air disdainful lip and the demeanor of an outraged queen followed by her companion who was paler and more disturbed than herself	99.8181764478845
On reaching her room Eugnie locked her door while Louise fell on a chair	55.678700446141185
Ah what a dreadful thing said the young musician who would have suspected it M	71.27909427185223
Andrea Cavalcanti a murderera galleyslave escapeda convict	113534.8819231624
An ironical smile curled the lip of Eugnie	99.2229832408487
In truth I was fated said she	36.53830833905324
I escaped the Morcerf only to fall into the Cavalcanti	43.212552474895396
Oh do not confound the two Eugnie	2099.420108326046
Hold your tongue The men are all infamous and I am happy to be able now to do more than detest themI despise them	123.41970273760512
What shall we do asked Louise	148.2699919284575
Why the same we had intended doing three days sinceset off	1165.7840224933195
Whatalthough you are not now going to be married you intend still	96.56626882899259
I hate this life of the fashionable world always ordered measured ruled like our musicpaper	1164.8019995646846
What I have always wished for desired and coveted is the life of an artist free and independent relying only on my own resources and accountable only to myself	309.42069154716455
Remain here What forthat they may try a month hence to marry me again and to whomM	254.15554529283796
Debray perhaps as it was once proposed	1039.8162338063098
No Louise no This evenings adventure will serve for my excuse	236.25781848919902
I did not seek one I did not ask for one	27.605614790098823
God sends me this and I hail it joyfully	934.607702814618
How strong and courageous you are said the fair frail girl to her brunette companion	214.73011322860305
Did you not yet know me Come Louise let us talk of our affairs	47.368909002798986
Was happily bought three days since	6.76362417192347
Have you had it sent where we are to go for it	130.70332364733335
And Eugnie with her usual precision opened a printed paper and read	292.56615386504035
Lon dArmilly twenty years of age profession artist hair black eyes black travelling with his sister	118.11781810182752
Capital How did you get this passport	592.2555377306014
When I went to ask M	56.68142178169355
de Monte Cristo for letters to the directors of the theatres at Rome and Naples I expressed my fears of travelling as a woman he perfectly understood them and undertook to procure for me a mans passport and two days after I received this to which I have added with my own hand travelling with his sister	85.7278391032545
Well said Eugnie cheerfully we have then only to pack up our trunks we shall start the evening of the signing of the contract instead of the evening of the weddingthat is all	78.62855331818024
But consider the matter seriously Eugnie	2125.7876240584246
Oh I am done with considering I am tired of hearing only of market reports of the end of the month of the rise and fall of Spanish funds of Haitian bonds	142.64923597317213
Instead of that Louisedo you understandair liberty melody of birds plains of Lombardy Venetian canals Roman palaces the Bay of Naples	1241.7777980802316
The young girl to whom this question was addressed drew from an inlaid secretaire a small portfolio with a lock in which she counted twentythree banknotes	181.50404244019313
And as much at least in pearls diamonds and jewels said Eugnie	209.03854696925893
With fortyfive thousand francs we can live like princesses for two years and comfortably for four but before six monthsyou with your music and I with my voicewe shall double our capital	283.61990863462876
Come you shall take charge of the money I of the jewelbox so that if one of us had the misfortune to lose her treasure the other would still have hers left	91.78574784926649
Now the portmanteaulet us make hastethe portmanteau	34867.10409195134
Stop said Louise going to listen at Madame Danglars door	68.35527344627718
They may tell us to open it	100.41818238657513
They may if they like but we will not	49.416534030750995
You are a perfect Amazon Eugnie And the two young girls began to heap into a trunk all the things they thought they should require	108.65714263336167
There now said Eugnie while I change my costume do you lock the portmanteau	183.89234746284313
Louise pressed with all the strength of her little hands on the top of the portmanteau	26.611021885763364
But I can not said she I am not strong enough do you shut it	54.9230593411853
Ah you do well to ask said Eugnie laughing I forgot that I was Hercules and you only the pale Omphale	94.69283458450664
And the young girl kneeling on the top pressed the two parts of the portmanteau together and Mademoiselle dArmilly passed the bolt of the padlock through	54.75673344350448
When this was done Eugnie opened a drawer of which she kept the key and took from it a wadded violet silk travelling cloak	176.3719877824252
Here said she you see I have thought of everything with this cloak you will not be cold	58.58443836039906
Oh I am never cold you know Besides with these mens clothes	295.78697027703447
Do not be uneasy you little coward All our servants are busy discussing the grand affair	554.4116331156565
Besides what is there astonishing when you think of the grief I ought to be in that I shut myself uptell me	57.545096250084356
From the same drawer she took a mans complete costume from the boots to the coat and a provision of linen where there was nothing superfluous but every requisite	145.79151838907822
Then with a promptitude which indicated that this was not the first time she had amused herself by adopting the garb of the opposite sex Eugnie drew on the boots and pantaloons tied her cravat buttoned her waistcoat up to the throat and put on a coat which admirably fitted her beautiful figure	85.31455742462434
Oh that is very goodindeed it is very good said Louise looking at her with admiration but that beautiful black hair those magnificent braids which made all the ladies sigh with envywill they go under a mans hat like the one I see down there	102.77345772757029
And with her left hand seizing the thick mass which her long fingers could scarcely grasp she took in her right hand a pair of long scissors and soon the steel met through the rich and splendid hair which fell in a cluster at her feet as she leaned back to keep it from her coat	102.34600951672563
Then she grasped the front hair which she also cut off without expressing the least regret on the contrary her eyes sparkled with greater pleasure than usual under her ebony eyebrows	74.34313562078106
Oh the magnificent hair said Louise with regret	95.13282654065844
And am I not a hundred times better thus cried Eugnie smoothing the scattered curls of her hair which had now quite a masculine appearance and do you not think me handsomer so	161.47745579483671
Oh you are beautifulalways beautiful cried Louise	81.77366280582835
To Brussels if you like it is the nearest frontier	122.76198768624154
We can go to Brussels Lige AixlaChapelle then up the Rhine to Strasbourg	1129.5638867697687
We will cross Switzerland and go down into Italy by the SaintGothard	162.2357249026114
I am looking at you indeed you are adorable like that One would say you were carrying me off	125.20226322562306
And they would be right pardieu	69726.19507848742
Oh I think you swore Eugnie	991.6982037150897
And the two young girls whom everyone might have thought plunged in grief the one on her own account the other from interest in her friend burst out laughing as they cleared away every visible trace of the disorder which had naturally accompanied the preparations for their escape	127.25351585396153
Then having blown out the lights the two fugitives looking and listening eagerly with outstretched necks opened the door of a dressingroom which led by a side staircase down to the yardEugnie going first and holding with one arm the portmanteau which by the opposite handle Mademoiselle dArmilly scarcely raised with both hands	130.14288387541978
The yard was empty the clock was striking twelve	159.6449283413472
The porter was not yet gone to bed	29.276570753656518
Eugnie approached softly and saw the old man sleeping soundly in an armchair in his lodge	47.50106015539297
She returned to Louise took up the portmanteau which she had placed for a moment on the ground and they reached the archway under the shadow of the wall	30.892838672842306
Eugnie concealed Louise in an angle of the gateway so that if the porter chanced to awake he might see but one person	95.42446508332708
Then placing herself in the full light of the lamp which lit the yard	68.56966246153986
Gate cried she with her finest contralto voice and rapping at the window	262.14281196847196
The porter got up as Eugnie expected and even advanced some steps to recognize the person who was going out but seeing a young man striking his boot impatiently with his ridingwhip he opened it immediately	77.97616985013309
Louise slid through the halfopen gate like a snake and bounded lightly forward	198.39126210037418
Eugnie apparently calm although in all probability her heart beat somewhat faster than usual went out in her turn	63.19245416167786
A porter was passing and they gave him the portmanteau then the two young girls having told him to take it to No	54.06791266812051
36 Rue de la Victoire walked behind this man whose presence comforted Louise	263.3664660211116
As for Eugnie she was as strong as a Judith or a Delilah	140.31273331127124
They arrived at the appointed spot	161.76573618022593
Eugnie ordered the porter to put down the portmanteau gave him some pieces of money and having rapped at the shutter sent him away	127.28186337134198
The shutter where Eugnie had rapped was that of a little laundress who had been previously warned and was not yet gone to bed	80.97541593860853
Mademoiselle said Eugnie let the porter get the postchaise from the coachhouse and fetch some posthorses from the hotel	200.3422225640277
Here are five francs for his trouble	214.4023940011241
Indeed said Louise I admire you and I could almost say respect you	64.39497425390587
The laundress looked on in astonishment but as she had been promised twenty louis she made no remark	89.81105073793313
In a quarter of an hour the porter returned with a postboy and horses which were harnessed and put in the postchaise in a minute while the porter fastened the portmanteau on with the assistance of a cord and strap	126.91159913557408
Here is the passport said the postilion which way are we going young gentleman	248.893560767832
To Fontainebleau replied Eugnie with an almost masculine voice	95.24141723808611
What do you say said Louise	124.73766886789252
I am giving them the slip said Eugnie this woman to whom we have given twenty louis may betray us for forty we will soon alter our direction	162.92429475095733
And the young girl jumped into the britzka which was admirably arranged for sleeping in without scarcely touching the step	180.70909605793977
You are always right said the music teacher seating herself by the side of her friend	142.8858161206476
A quarter of an hour afterwards the postilion having been put in the right road passed with a crack of his whip through the gateway of the Barrire SaintMartin	131.04213862751885
Ah said Louise breathing freely here we are out of Paris	47.57628724334022
Yes my dear the abduction is an accomplished fact replied Eugnie	124.6259345513499
Yes and without violence said Louise	285.2285385557466
I shall bring that forward as an extenuating circumstance replied Eugnie	327.31227822244506
These words were lost in the noise which the carriage made in rolling over the pavement of La Villette	77.35869263338122
Danglars no longer had a daughter	301.5019470425695
And now let us leave Mademoiselle Danglars and her friend pursuing their way to Brussels and return to poor Andrea Cavalcanti so inopportunely interrupted in his rise to fortune	174.2049875954406
Notwithstanding his youth Master Andrea was a very skilful and intelligent boy	107.42422781817783
We have seen that on the first rumor which reached the salon he had gradually approached the door and crossing two or three rooms at last disappeared	56.787132930990154
But we have forgotten to mention one circumstance which nevertheless ought not to be omitted in one of the rooms he crossed the trousseau of the brideelect was on exhibition	162.07364146800242
There were caskets of diamonds cashmere shawls Valenciennes lace English veils and in fact all the tempting things the bare mention of which makes the hearts of young girls bound with joy and which is called the corbeille	271.3869766856661
22 Now in passing through this room Andrea proved himself not only to be clever and intelligent but also provident for he helped himself to the most valuable of the ornaments before him	161.5899487923577
Furnished with this plunder Andrea leaped with a lighter heart from the window intending to slip through the hands of the gendarmes	70.5239879785282
Tall and well proportioned as an ancient gladiator and muscular as a Spartan he walked for a quarter of an hour without knowing where to direct his steps actuated by the sole idea of getting away from the spot where if he lingered he knew that he would surely be taken	90.9985530145085
Having passed through the Rue du MontBlanc guided by the instinct which leads thieves always to take the safest path he found himself at the end of the Rue La Fayette	65.54768114980737
There he stopped breathless and panting	37482.611961587434
He was quite alone on one side was the vast wilderness of the SaintLazare on the other Paris enshrouded in darkness	115.87439446748051
Am I to be captured he cried no not if I can use more activity than my enemies	114.42713453191136
My safety is now a mere question of speed	184.69521231321696
At this moment he saw a cab at the top of the Faubourg Poissonnire	28.56194119243171
The dull driver smoking his pipe was plodding along toward the limits of the Faubourg SaintDenis where no doubt he ordinarily had his station	194.4590352348907
What do you want sir asked the driver	24.788933480926183
Tired oh yes tired enoughhe has done nothing the whole of this blessed day Four wretched fares and twenty sous over making in all seven francs are all that I have earned and I ought to take ten to the owner	149.21644792277857
Will you add these twenty francs to the seven you have	31.63655099412417
With pleasure sir twenty francs are not to be despised	23.674461798244536
Tell me what I am to do for this	27.563486983171344
A very easy thing if your horse is nt tired	81.42836857211485
I tell you hell go like the windonly tell me which way to drive	221.18919474683742
Ah I know the wayyou get good sweetened rum over there	2081.149251228188
Exactly so I merely wish to overtake one of my friends with whom I am going to hunt tomorrow at ChapelleenServal	45.633747478500304
He should have waited for me here with a cabriolet till halfpast eleven it is twelve and tired of waiting he must have gone on	97.85594880508698
Well will you try and overtake him	254.31714399240698
If you do not overtake him before we reach Bourget you shall have twenty francs if not before Louvres thirty	320.8247564548943
And if we do overtake him	66.90538754715108
Forty said Andrea after a moments hesitation at the end of which he remembered that he might safely promise	44.67878596334365
That s all right said the man hop in and were off Whooopla	506.9819300669564
Andrea got into the cab which passed rapidly through the Faubourg SaintDenis along the Faubourg SaintMartin crossed the barrier and threaded its way through the interminable Villette	110.53133241209122
They never overtook the chimerical friend yet Andrea frequently inquired of people on foot whom he passed and at the inns which were not yet closed for a green cabriolet and bay horse and as there are a great many cabriolets to be seen on the road to the Low Countries and as ninetenths of them are green the inquiries increased at every step	156.86050475079875
Everyone had just seen it pass it was only five hundred two hundred one hundred steps in advance at length they reached it but it was not the friend	37.64336336846745
Once the cab was also passed by a calash rapidly whirled along by two posthorses	209.7467864436652
Ah said Cavalcanti to himself if I only had that britzka those two good posthorses and above all the passport that carries them on And he sighed deeply	261.7542561919327
The calash contained Mademoiselle Danglars and Mademoiselle dArmilly	22.34887710794248
Hurry hurry said Andrea we must overtake him soon	157.0815097612398
And the poor horse resumed the desperate gallop it had kept up since leaving the barrier and arrived steaming at Louvres	187.7227779622786
Certainly said Andrea I shall not overtake my friend but I shall kill your horse therefore I had better stop	76.54399172540366
Here are thirty francs I will sleep at the Cheval Rouge and will secure a place in the first coach	112.4768069330022
And Andrea after placing six pieces of five francs each in the mans hand leaped lightly on to the pathway	70.6198507161554
The cabman joyfully pocketed the sum and turned back on his road to Paris	29.554548994523817
Andrea pretended to go towards the hotel of the Cheval Rouge but after leaning an instant against the door and hearing the last sound of the cab which was disappearing from view he went on his road and with a lusty stride soon traversed the space of two leagues	98.17517742187223
Then he rested he must be near ChapelleenServal where he pretended to be going	118.3537190581045
It was not fatigue that stayed Andrea here it was that he might form some resolution adopt some plan	212.2778364803043
It would be impossible to make use of a diligence equally so to engage posthorses to travel either way a passport was necessary	350.9409080590047
It was still more impossible to remain in the department of the Oise one of the most open and strictly guarded in France this was quite out of the question especially to a man like Andrea perfectly conversant with criminal matters	128.09287441335218
He sat down by the side of the moat buried his face in his hands and reflected	30.385539650458544
Ten minutes after he raised his head his resolution was made	31.154434308550826
He threw some dust over the topcoat which he had found time to unhook from the antechamber and button over his ball costume and going to ChapelleenServal he knocked loudly at the door of the only inn in the place	86.40472323335483
My friend said Andrea I was coming from Mortefontaine to Senlis when my horse which is a troublesome creature stumbled and threw me	220.4788830203357
I must reach Compigne tonight or I shall cause deep anxiety to my family	109.54073543834345
Could you let me hire a horse of you	45.49072771453281
An innkeeper has always a horse to let whether it be good or bad	116.89031679927243
The host called the stableboy and ordered him to saddle Le Blanc then he awoke his son a child of seven years whom he ordered to ride before the gentleman and bring back the horse	88.76667045597218
Andrea gave the innkeeper twenty francs and in taking them from his pocket dropped a visiting card	175.3289641260387
This belonged to one of his friends at the Caf de Paris so that the innkeeper picking it up after Andrea had left was convinced that he had let his horse to the Count of Maulon 25 Rue SaintDominique that being the name and address on the card	87.48552206801115
Le Blanc was not a fast animal but he kept up an easy steady pace in three hours and a half Andrea had traversed the nine leagues which separated him from Compigne and four oclock struck as he reached the place where the coaches stop	134.45104370822787
There is an excellent tavern at Compigne well remembered by those who have ever been there	95.71237843278784
Andrea who had often stayed there in his rides about Paris recollected the Bell and Bottle inn he turned around saw the sign by the light of a reflected lamp and having dismissed the child giving him all the small coin he had about him he began knocking at the door very reasonably concluding that having now three or four hours before him he had best fortify himself against the fatigues of the morrow by a sound sleep and a good supper	122.372566022896
My friend said Andrea I have been dining at SaintJeanauxBois and expected to catch the coach which passes by at midnight but like a fool I have lost my way and have been walking for the last four hours in the forest	67.22107908213626
Show me into one of those pretty little rooms which overlook the court and bring me a cold fowl and a bottle of Bordeaux	141.6638064711264
The waiter had no suspicions Andrea spoke with perfect composure he had a cigar in his mouth and his hands in the pocket of his top coat his clothes were fashionably made his chin smooth his boots irreproachable he looked merely as if he had stayed out very late that was all	98.07784152508805
While the waiter was preparing his room the hostess arose Andrea assumed his most charming smile and asked if he could have No	124.12955337166422
3 which he had occupied on his last stay at Compigne	217.07303936813858
3 was engaged by a young man who was travelling with his sister	22.817085600475092
Andrea appeared in despair but consoled himself when the hostess assured him that No	282.89783859523044
7 prepared for him was situated precisely the same as No	574.8929403720203
3 and while warming his feet and chatting about the last races at Chantilly he waited until they announced his room to be ready	127.87214234411499
Andrea had not spoken without cause of the pretty rooms looking out upon the court of the Bell Hotel which with its triple galleries like those of a theatre with the jessamine and clematis twining round the light columns forms one of the prettiest entrances to an inn that you can imagine	174.85521293855928
The fowl was tender the wine old the fire clear and sparkling and Andrea was surprised to find himself eating with as good an appetite as though nothing had happened	163.61563203499924
Then he went to bed and almost immediately fell into that deep sleep which is sure to visit men of twenty years of age even when they are torn with remorse	59.489835598916464
Now here we are obliged to own that Andrea ought to have felt remorse but that he did not	61.92836530232743
This was the plan which had appealed to him to afford the best chance of his security	99.16190960740825
Before daybreak he would awake leave the inn after rigorously paying his bill and reaching the forest he would under pretence of making studies in painting test the hospitality of some peasants procure himself the dress of a woodcutter and a hatchet casting off the lions skin to assume that of the woodman then with his hands covered with dirt his hair darkened by means of a leaden comb his complexion embrowned with a preparation for which one of his old comrades had given him the recipe he intended by following the wooded districts to reach the nearest frontier walking by night and sleeping in the day in the forests and quarries and only entering inhabited regions to buy a loaf from time to time	203.23442897761655
Once past the frontier Andrea proposed making money of his diamonds and by uniting the proceeds to ten banknotes he always carried about with him in case of accident he would then find himself possessor of about 50000 livres which he philosophically considered as no very deplorable condition after all	234.46767792106192
Moreover he reckoned much on the interest of the Danglars to hush up the rumor of their own misadventures	128.03408456942557
These were the reasons which added to the fatigue caused Andrea to sleep so soundly	249.64194252073122
In order that he might wake early he did not close the shutters but contented himself with bolting the door and placing on the table an unclasped and longpointed knife whose temper he well knew and which was never absent from him	169.92262342183795
About seven in the morning Andrea was awakened by a ray of sunlight which played warm and brilliant upon his face	49.9719858038277
In all wellorganized brains the predominating ideaand there always is oneis sure to be the last thought before sleeping and the first upon waking in the morning	296.0916285159103
Andrea had scarcely opened his eyes when his predominating idea presented itself and whispered in his ear that he had slept too long	110.20610983900255
He jumped out of bed and ran to the window	6.150055231017395
A gendarme was crossing the court	32.76413864538968
A gendarme is one of the most striking objects in the world even to a man void of uneasiness but for one who has a timid conscience and with good cause too the yellow blue and white uniform is really very alarming	110.86342062902173
Why is that gendarme there asked Andrea of himself	63.91934404738114
Then all at once he replied with that logic which the reader has doubtless remarked in him There is nothing astonishing in seeing a gendarme at an inn instead of being astonished let me dress myself	192.96326764721874
And the youth dressed himself with a facility his valet de chambre had failed to rob him of during the two months of fashionable life he had led in Paris	44.57786294968321
Now then said Andrea while dressing himself Ill wait till he leaves and then Ill slip away	248.77228361788988
And saying this Andrea who had now put on his boots and cravat stole gently to the window and a second time lifted up the muslin curtain	84.7861455880161
Not only was the first gendarme still there but the young man now perceived a second yellow blue and white uniform at the foot of the staircase the only one by which he could descend while a third on horseback holding a musket in his fist was posted as a sentinel at the great streetdoor which alone afforded the means of egress	98.39188149795135
The appearance of the third gendarme settled the matter for a crowd of curious loungers was extended before him effectually blocking the entrance to the hotel	210.48083530022078
They re after me was Andreas first thought	1098.6447394582226
A pallor overspread the young mans forehead and he looked around him with anxiety	25.952144756471956
His room like all those on the same floor had but one outlet to the gallery in the sight of everybody	69.29294984059936
I am lost was his second thought and indeed for a man in Andreas situation an arrest meant the assizes trial and deathdeath without mercy or delay	364.24290869418394
For a moment he convulsively pressed his head within his hands and during that brief period he became nearly mad with terror but soon a ray of hope glimmered in the multitude of thoughts which bewildered his mind and a faint smile played upon his white lips and pallid cheeks	81.83118629840502
He looked around and saw the objects of his search upon the chimneypiece they were a pen ink and paper	41.47666744249964
With forced composure he dipped the pen in the ink and wrote the following lines upon a sheet of paper	25.22211072614076
I have no money to pay my bill but I am not a dishonest man I leave behind me as a pledge this pin worth ten times the amount	84.91990642848033
I shall be excused for leaving at daybreak for I was ashamed	104.01695698932876
He then drew the pin from his cravat and placed it on the paper	11.938006518361915
This done instead of leaving the door fastened he drew back the bolts and even placed the door ajar as though he had left the room forgetting to close it and slipping into the chimney like a man accustomed to that kind of gymnastic exercise after replacing the chimneyboard which represented Achilles with Deidamia and effacing the very marks of his feet upon the ashes he commenced climbing the hollow tunnel which afforded him the only means of escape left	131.10517930700667
At this precise time the first gendarme Andrea had noticed walked upstairs preceded by the commissary of police and supported by the second gendarme who guarded the staircase and was himself reinforced by the one stationed at the door	74.51595626220329
Andrea was indebted for this visit to the following circumstances	60.82155215678079
At daybreak the telegraphs were set at work in all directions and almost immediately the authorities in every district had exerted their utmost endeavors to arrest the murderer of Caderousse	203.7096119587809
Compigne that royal residence and fortified town is well furnished with authorities gendarmes and commissaries of police they therefore began operations as soon as the telegraphic despatch arrived and the Bell and Bottle being the bestknown hotel in the town they had naturally directed their first inquiries there	288.15220428766935
Now besides the reports of the sentinels guarding the Htel de Ville which is next door to the Bell and Bottle it had been stated by others that a number of travellers had arrived during the night	68.84333379531917
The sentinel who was relieved at six oclock in the morning remembered perfectly that just as he was taking his post a few minutes past four a young man arrived on horseback with a little boy before him	59.09221213048034
The young man having dismissed the boy and horse knocked at the door of the hotel which was opened and again closed after his entrance	34.345818813164634
This late arrival had attracted much suspicion and the young man being no other than Andrea the commissary and gendarme who was a brigadier directed their steps towards his room	114.05487119770065
Oh oh said the brigadier who thoroughly understood the trick a bad sign to find the door open I would rather find it triply bolted	169.20987912564556
And indeed the little note and pin upon the table confirmed or rather corroborated the sad truth	135.1031743880375
We say corroborated because the brigadier was too experienced to be convinced by a single proof	62.491733212232624
He glanced around looked in the bed shook the curtains opened the closets and finally stopped at the chimney	85.00152992048734
Andrea had taken the precaution to leave no traces of his feet in the ashes but still it was an outlet and in this light was not to be passed over without serious investigation	79.40114653023804
The brigadier sent for some sticks and straw and having filled the chimney with them set a light to it	199.08325704337122
The fire crackled and the smoke ascended like the dull vapor from a volcano but still no prisoner fell down as they expected	131.5671877476388
The fact was that Andrea at war with society ever since his youth was quite as deep as a gendarme even though he were advanced to the rank of brigadier and quite prepared for the fire he had climbed out on the roof and was crouching down against the chimneypots	95.79097590158817
At one time he thought he was saved for he heard the brigadier exclaim in a loud voice to the two gendarmes He is not here But venturing to peep he perceived that the latter instead of retiring as might have been reasonably expected upon this announcement were watching with increased attention	133.33006423468905
It was now his turn to look about him the Htel de Ville a massive sixteenth century building was on his right anyone could descend from the openings in the tower and examine every corner of the roof below and Andrea expected momentarily to see the head of a gendarme appear at one of these openings	110.97583247019146
If once discovered he knew he would be lost for the roof afforded no chance of escape he therefore resolved to descend not through the same chimney by which he had come up but by a similar one conducting to another room	92.0202098976
He looked around for a chimney from which no smoke issued and having reached it he disappeared through the orifice without being seen by anyone	147.3828048733316
At the same minute one of the little windows of the Htel de Ville was thrown open and the head of a gendarme appeared	18.671632812198922
For an instant it remained motionless as one of the stone decorations of the building then after a long sigh of disappointment the head disappeared	77.95460282797764
The brigadier calm and dignified as the law he represented passed through the crowd without answering the thousand questions addressed to him and reentered the hotel	93.10028582873356
Well my boys said the brigadier the brigand must really have escaped early this morning but we will send to the VillersCoterets and Noyon roads and search the forest when we shall catch him no doubt	185.36064355698684
The honorable functionary had scarcely expressed himself thus in that intonation which is peculiar to brigadiers of the gendarmerie when a loud scream accompanied by the violent ringing of a bell resounded through the court of the hotel	104.5649618149863
Ah what is that cried the brigadier	136.2750859651821
Some traveller seems impatient said the host	38.03664749361433
What number was it that rang	21190.28262624873
At this moment the screams and ringing were redoubled	467.43873653097535
Aha said the brigadier stopping the servant the person who is ringing appears to want something more than a waiter we will attend upon him with a gendarme	77.25376021926037
The little fellow who arrived last night in a postchaise with his sister and who asked for an apartment with two beds	111.23376722379588
The bell here rang for the third time with another shriek of anguish	53.49795568821748
Commissary said the brigadier tread in my steps	78.6461817539245
Wait an instant said the host Number 3 has two staircasesinside and outside	866.5159886862184
I will take charge of the inside one	193.84945578834075
Well you guard the exterior and if he attempts to fly fire upon him he must be a great criminal from what the telegraph says	79.37199775847506
The brigadier followed by the commissary disappeared by the inside staircase accompanied by the noise which his assertions respecting Andrea had excited in the crowd	89.442932095715
This is what had happened Andrea had very cleverly managed to descend twothirds of the chimney but then his foot slipped and notwithstanding his endeavors he came into the room with more speed and noise than he intended	122.01939704264613
It would have signified little had the room been empty but unfortunately it was occupied	145.43930079724743
Two ladies sleeping in one bed were awakened by the noise and fixing their eyes upon the spot whence the sound proceeded they saw a man	45.65768709121327
One of these ladies the fair one uttered those terrible shrieks which resounded through the house while the other rushing to the bellrope rang with all her strength	136.47319345575752
Andrea as we can see was surrounded by misfortune	336.8618823775801
For pitys sake he cried pale and bewildered without seeing whom he was addressingfor pitys sake do not call assistance Save meI will not harm you	172.64236968583802
Andrea the murderer cried one of the ladies	11.172926261037734
Eugnie Mademoiselle Danglars exclaimed Andrea stupefied	751.7688482433351
Help help cried Mademoiselle dArmilly taking the bell from her companions hand and ringing it yet more violently	97.05932145065222
Save me I am pursued said Andrea clasping his hands	18.30340724343529
For pity for mercys sake do not deliver me up	26.903426112493722
It is too late they are coming said Eugnie	98.43380751897702
Well conceal me somewhere you can say you were needlessly alarmed you can turn their suspicions and save my life	131.9650546956313
The two ladies pressing closely to one another and drawing the bedclothes tightly around them remained silent to this supplicating voice repugnance and fear taking possession of their minds	245.35013719962825
Well be it so at length said Eugnie return by the same road you came and we will say nothing about you unhappy wretch	66.14852797518455
Here he is here he is cried a voice from the landing here he is I see him	72.76560832272949
The brigadier had put his eye to the keyhole and had discovered Andrea in a posture of entreaty	141.8601944395679
A violent blow from the butt end of the musket burst open the lock two more forced out the bolts and the broken door fell in	89.92810103485364
Andrea ran to the other door leading to the gallery ready to rush out but he was stopped short and he stood with his body a little thrown back pale and with the useless knife in his clenched hand	63.8776871818412
Fly then cried Mademoiselle dArmilly whose pity returned as her fears diminished fly	1061.0570729856881
Or kill yourself said Eugnie in a tone which a Vestal in the amphitheatre would have used when urging the victorious gladiator to finish his vanquished adversary	353.72199073333934
Andrea shuddered and looked on the young girl with an expression which proved how little he understood such ferocious honor	54.25127460974644
Kill myself he cried throwing down his knife why should I do so	32.63849170039239
Why you said answered Mademoiselle Danglars that you would be condemned to die like the worst criminals	51.95021426697371
Bah said Cavalcanti crossing his arms one has friends	155.6055346128487
The brigadier advanced to him sword in hand	408.01479044394404
Come come said Andrea sheathe your sword my fine fellow there is no occasion to make such a fuss since I give myself up and he held out his hands to be manacled	53.85135619310761
The two girls looked with horror upon this shameful metamorphosis the man of the world shaking off his covering and appearing as a galleyslave	189.91629888984085
Andrea turned towards them and with an impertinent smile asked Have you any message for your father Mademoiselle Danglars for in all probability I shall return to Paris	39.55609362541479
Eugnie covered her face with her hands	7.032265337507764
Oh oh said Andrea you need not be ashamed even though you did post after me	225.5071967097552
Was I not nearly your husband	372.4518774765453
And with this raillery Andrea went out leaving the two girls a prey to their own feelings of shame and to the comments of the crowd	71.20510652939008
An hour after they stepped into their calash both dressed in feminine attire	315.0342630041479
The gate of the hotel had been closed to screen them from sight but they were forced when the door was open to pass through a throng of curious glances and whispering voices	91.97645405051794
Eugnie closed her eyes but though she could not see she could hear and the sneers of the crowd reached her in the carriage	44.496499087121975
Oh why is not the world a wilderness she exclaimed throwing herself into the arms of Mademoiselle dArmilly her eyes sparkling with the same kind of rage which made Nero wish that the Roman world had but one neck that he might sever it at a single blow	80.60787948312428
The next day they stopped at the Htel de Flandre at Brussels	66.49369788782295
The same evening Andrea was incarcerated in the Conciergerie	850.1831341111844
We have seen how quietly Mademoiselle Danglars and Mademoiselle dArmilly accomplished their transformation and flight the fact being that everyone was too much occupied in his or her own affairs to think of theirs	126.84092954209699
We will leave the banker contemplating the enormous magnitude of his debt before the phantom of bankruptcy and follow the baroness who after being momentarily crushed under the weight of the blow which had struck her had gone to seek her usual adviser Lucien Debray	141.63379641951528
The baroness had looked forward to this marriage as a means of ridding her of a guardianship which over a girl of Eugnies character could not fail to be rather a troublesome undertaking for in the tacit relations which maintain the bond of family union the mother to maintain her ascendancy over her daughter must never fail to be a model of wisdom and a type of perfection	168.99174579837347
Now Madame Danglars feared Eugnies sagacity and the influence of Mademoiselle dArmilly she had frequently observed the contemptuous expression with which her daughter looked upon Debrayan expression which seemed to imply that she understood all her mothers amorous and pecuniary relationships with the intimate secretary moreover she saw that Eugnie detested Debray not only because he was a source of dissension and scandal under the paternal roof but because she had at once classed him in that catalogue of bipeds whom Plato endeavors to withdraw from the appellation of men and whom Diogenes designated as animals upon two legs without feathers	224.22729621236834
Unfortunately in this world of ours each person views things through a certain medium and so is prevented from seeing in the same light as others and Madame Danglars therefore very much regretted that the marriage of Eugnie had not taken place not only because the match was good and likely to insure the happiness of her child but because it would also set her at liberty	107.79539373211827
She ran therefore to Debray who after having like the rest of Paris witnessed the contract scene and the scandal attending it had retired in haste to his club where he was chatting with some friends upon the events which served as a subject of conversation for threefourths of that city known as the capital of the world	109.02691751504855
At the precise time when Madame Danglars dressed in black and concealed in a long veil was ascending the stairs leading to Debrays apartments notwithstanding the assurances of the concierge that the young man was not at home Debray was occupied in repelling the insinuations of a friend who tried to persuade him that after the terrible scene which had just taken place he ought as a friend of the family to marry Mademoiselle Danglars and her two millions	45.07420512278513
Debray did not defend himself very warmly for the idea had sometimes crossed his mind still when he recollected the independent proud spirit of Eugnie he positively rejected it as utterly impossible though the same thought again continually recurred and found a restingplace in his heart	238.60255761810623
Tea play and the conversation which had become interesting during the discussion of such serious affairs lasted till one oclock in the morning	56.795814854964554
Meanwhile Madame Danglars veiled and uneasy awaited the return of Debray in the little green room seated between two baskets of flowers which she had that morning sent and which it must be confessed Debray had himself arranged and watered with so much care that his absence was half excused in the eyes of the poor woman	89.18371562292681
At twenty minutes to twelve Madame Danglars tired of waiting returned home	134.04540843730217
Women of a certain grade are like prosperous grisettes in one respect they seldom return home after twelve oclock	427.1188077893131
The baroness returned to the hotel with as much caution as Eugnie used in leaving it she ran lightly upstairs and with an aching heart entered her apartment contiguous as we know to that of Eugnie	119.86561159561334
She was fearful of exciting any remark and believed firmly in her daughters innocence and fidelity to the paternal roof	262.994268128559
She listened at Eugnies door and hearing no sound tried to enter but the bolts were in place	97.93828696318769
Madame Danglars then concluded that the young girl had been overcome with the terrible excitement of the evening and had gone to bed and to sleep	24.251190151375795
She called the maid and questioned her	155.7803052334937
Mademoiselle Eugnie said the maid retired to her apartment with Mademoiselle dArmilly they then took tea together after which they desired me to leave saying that they needed me no longer	95.41504659988507
Since then the maid had been below and like everyone else she thought the young ladies were in their own room Madame Danglars therefore went to bed without a shadow of suspicion and began to muse over the recent events	104.98285855198105
In proportion as her memory became clearer the occurrences of the evening were revealed in their true light what she had taken for confusion was a tumult what she had regarded as something distressing was in reality a disgrace	217.33653999139028
And then the baroness remembered that she had felt no pity for poor Mercds who had been afflicted with as severe a blow through her husband and son	73.87882148350317
Eugnie she said to herself is lost and so are we	175.79741234901752
The affair as it will be reported will cover us with shame for in a society such as ours satire inflicts a painful and incurable wound	305.15496301458893
How fortunate that Eugnie is possessed of that strange character which has so often made me tremble	73.96445465166909
And her glance was turned towards heaven where a mysterious Providence disposes all things and out of a fault nay even a vice sometimes produces a blessing	259.8057479884668
And then her thoughts cleaving through space like a bird in the air rested on Cavalcanti	117.94490176567761
This Andrea was a wretch a robber an assassin and yet his manners showed the effects of a sort of education if not a complete one he had been presented to the world with the appearance of an immense fortune supported by an honorable name	79.91488730796398
How could she extricate herself from this labyrinth To whom would she apply to help her out of this painful situation Debray to whom she had run with the first instinct of a woman towards the man she loves and who yet betrays herDebray could but give her advice she must apply to someone more powerful than he	141.19137547701374
The baroness then thought of M	129.98316443774576
de Villefort who had remorselessly brought misfortune into her family as though they had been strangers	123.75349889656589
But no on reflection the procureur was not a merciless man and it was not the magistrate slave to his duties but the friend the loyal friend who roughly but firmly cut into the very core of the corruption it was not the executioner but the surgeon who wished to withdraw the honor of Danglars from ignominious association with the disgraced young man they had presented to the world as their soninlaw	123.3350409420667
And since Villefort the friend of Danglars had acted in this way no one could suppose that he had been previously acquainted with or had lent himself to any of Andreas intrigues	87.95818023299968
Villeforts conduct therefore upon reflection appeared to the baroness as if shaped for their mutual advantage	128.5009642300485
But the inflexibility of the procureur should stop there she would see him the next day and if she could not make him fail in his duties as a magistrate she would at least obtain all the indulgence he could allow	71.72583642895351
She would invoke the past recall old recollections she would supplicate him by the remembrance of guilty yet happy days	329.09375404690024
de Villefort would stifle the affair he had only to turn his eyes on one side and allow Andrea to fly and follow up the crime under that shadow of guilt called contempt of court	99.35584928709613
And after this reasoning she slept easily	1154.9756994328352
At nine oclock next morning she arose and without ringing for her maid or giving the least sign of her activity she dressed herself in the same simple style as on the previous night then running downstairs she left the hotel walked to the Rue de Provence called a cab and drove to M	76.32369772691244
For the last month this wretched house had presented the gloomy appearance of a lazaretto infected with the plague	161.38350446490554
Some of the apartments were closed within and without the shutters were only opened to admit a minutes air showing the scared face of a footman and immediately afterwards the window would be closed like a gravestone falling on a sepulchre and the neighbors would say to each other in a low voice Will there be another funeral today at the procureurs house	124.63898308026724
Madame Danglars involuntarily shuddered at the desolate aspect of the mansion descending from the cab she approached the door with trembling knees and rang the bell	53.128839211812476
Three times did the bell ring with a dull heavy sound seeming to participate in the general sadness before the concierge appeared and peeped through the door which he opened just wide enough to allow his words to be heard	90.58088230296147
He saw a lady a fashionable elegantly dressed lady and yet the door remained almost closed	181.96212375099586
Do you intend opening the door said the baroness	21.32843119554448
Who am I You know me well enough	71.98425219758224
We no longer know anyone madame	132.59578099406556
You must be mad my friend said the baroness	9.696179509189037
Madame these are my orders excuse me	21.342516470454896
The baroness Danglars you have seen me twenty times	35.53716506043896
And now what do you want	13.989854200700655
Oh how extraordinary I shall complain to M	116.08739942487806
de Villefort of the impertinence of his servants	18.892779857050826
Madame this is precaution not impertinence no one enters here without an order from M	176.963954648857
dAvrigny or without speaking to the procureur	25.900404155812467
Well I have business with the procureur	43.775803157067216
You can imagine so since I have not even brought my carriage out yet	79.65053587349225
But enough of thishere is my card take it to your master	109.45588891699585
The concierge closed the door leaving Madame Danglars in the street	45.09064389644697
She had not long to wait directly afterwards the door was opened wide enough to admit her and when she had passed through it was again shut	55.003628475322856
Without losing sight of her for an instant the concierge took a whistle from his pocket as soon as they entered the court and blew it	48.42987230046118
The valet de chambre appeared on the doorsteps	58.01507901050497
You will excuse this poor fellow madame he said as he preceded the baroness but his orders are precise and M	77.11810947691914
de Villefort begged me to tell you that he could not act otherwise	36.20091525236897
In the court showing his merchandise was a tradesman who had been admitted with the same precautions	89.94089477848269
The baroness ascended the steps she felt herself strongly infected with the sadness which seemed to magnify her own and still guided by the valet de chambre who never lost sight of her for an instant she was introduced to the magistrates study	49.614614342773514
Preoccupied as Madame Danglars had been with the object of her visit the treatment she had received from these underlings appeared to her so insulting that she began by complaining of it	95.55018613809213
But Villefort raising his head bowed down by grief looked up at her with so sad a smile that her complaints died upon her lips	73.25036219592477
Forgive my servants he said for a terror I can not blame them for from being suspected they have become suspicious	106.38492578180552
Madame Danglars had often heard of the terror to which the magistrate alluded but without the evidence of her own eyesight she could never have believed that the sentiment had been carried so far	66.62303156614988
You too then are unhappy she said	48.9355206151958
And you understand what brings me here	29.976496733458927
You wish to speak to me about the circumstance which has just happened	43.63388810024684
Alas madame said the procureur with his imperturbable calmness of manner I consider those alone misfortunes which are irreparable	195.76645904069628
And do you suppose this will be forgotten	47.298153675371054
Everything will be forgotten madame said Villefort	4.710087095357843
Your daughter will be married tomorrow if not todayin a week if not tomorrow and I do not think you can regret the intended husband of your daughter	103.67571756951055
Madame Danglars gazed on Villefort stupefied to find him so almost insultingly calm	521.0296048710287
Am I come to a friend she asked in a tone full of mournful dignity	58.67088731604383
You know that you are madame said Villefort whose pale cheeks became slightly flushed as he gave her the assurance	44.33045567098894
And truly this assurance carried him back to different events from those now occupying the baroness and him	232.84853216299672
Well then be more affectionate my dear Villefort said the baroness	21.839254191245733
Speak to me not as a magistrate but as a friend and when I am in bitter anguish of spirit do not tell me that I ought to be gay	30.511447545000788
When I hear misfortunes named madame he said I have within the last few months contracted the bad habit of thinking of my own and then I can not help drawing up an egotistical parallel in my mind	93.97701137521953
That is the reason that by the side of my misfortunes yours appear to me mere mischances that is why my dreadful position makes yours appear enviable	215.46882310240971
But this annoys you let us change the subject	56.48135436957917
I came to ask you my friend said the baroness what will be done with this impostor	37.121894356832456
Impostor repeated Villefort certainly madame you appear to extenuate some cases and exaggerate others	372.44942069993624
Benedetto is nothing more nor less than an assassin	10.53136087312003
Sir I do not deny the justice of your correction but the more severely you arm yourself against that unfortunate man the more deeply will you strike our family	139.37277228328554
Come forget him for a moment and instead of pursuing him let him go	51.06565567529133
You are too late madame the orders are issued	519.809332562449
Well should he be arresteddo they think they will arrest him	136.85014059438456
If they should arrest him I know that sometimes prisons afford means of escape will you leave him in prison	220.23194158408828
At least keep him there till my daughter be married	85.47177519954023
Impossible madame justice has its formalities	629.9371547010788
What even for me said the baroness half jesting half in earnest	155.88345980707584
For all even for myself among the rest replied Villefort	56.49249942635207
Ah exclaimed the baroness without expressing the ideas which the exclamation betrayed	204.83411051559884
Villefort looked at her with that piercing glance which reads the secrets of the heart	101.26045776537663
Yes I know what you mean he said you refer to the terrible rumors spread abroad in the world that the deaths which have kept me in mourning for the last three months and from which Valentine has only escaped by a miracle have not happened by natural means	82.81067594428342
I was not thinking of that replied Madame Danglars quickly	57.804243892670634
Yes you were thinking of it and with justice	125.3745532115687
You could not help thinking of it and saying to yourself you who pursue crime so vindictively answer now why are there unpunished crimes in your dwelling The baroness became pale	230.62318753717744
You were saying this were you not	11.087802631390403
Villefort drew his armchair nearer to Madame Danglars then resting both hands upon his desk he said in a voice more hollow than usual	33.83275108340722
There are crimes which remain unpunished because the criminals are unknown and we might strike the innocent instead of the guilty but when the culprits are discovered Villefort here extended his hand toward a large crucifix placed opposite to his deskwhen they are discovered I swear to you by all I hold most sacred that whoever they may be they shall die	147.8101093680396
Now after the oath I have just taken and which I will keep madame dare you ask for mercy for that wretch	119.5704567232743
But sir are you sure he is as guilty as they say	27.858576609715335
Listen this is his description Benedetto condemned at the age of sixteen for five years to the galleys for forgery	143.78526159329982
He promised well as you seefirst a runaway then an assassin	1629.5059902985558
Who can tella vagabond a Corsican	658.2381546359115
No one his parents are unknown	161.02615586977075
But who was the man who brought him from Lucca	55.05572960268636
Another rascal like himself perhaps his accomplice	864.3101357336596
Villefort she exclaimed in her softest and most captivating manner	1500.1329281380742
For Heavens sake madame said Villefort with a firmness of expression not altogether free from harshnessfor Heavens sake do not ask pardon of me for a guilty wretch What am Ithe law	108.5962350199255
Has the law any eyes to witness your grief Has the law ears to be melted by your sweet voice Has the law a memory for all those soft recollections you endeavor to recall No madame the law has commanded and when it commands it strikes	160.2141284218715
You will tell me that I am a living being and not a codea man and not a volume	93.35640052825909
Look at me madamelook around me	9.348473251010219
Has mankind treated me as a brother Have men loved me Have they spared me Has anyone shown the mercy towards me that you now ask at my hands No madame they struck me always struck me	158.6215436077282
Woman siren that you are do you persist in fixing on me that fascinating eye which reminds me that I ought to blush Well be it so let me blush for the faults you know and perhapsperhaps for even more than those But having sinned myselfit may be more deeply than othersI never rest till I have torn the disguises from my fellowcreatures and found out their weaknesses	240.40569287034205
I have always found them and moreI repeat it with joy with triumphI have always found some proof of human perversity or error	297.02839344352094
Every criminal I condemn seems to me living evidence that I am not a hideous exception to the rest	92.40671876705095
Alas alas alas all the world is wicked let us therefore strike at wickedness	315.84046913042846
Villefort pronounced these last words with a feverish rage which gave a ferocious eloquence to his words	130.8057624325174
But said Madame Danglars resolving to make a last effort this young man though a murderer is an orphan abandoned by everybody	88.29158204867836
So much the worse or rather so much the better it has been so ordained that he may have none to weep his fate	52.671223343366556
But this is trampling on the weak sir	210.25596924636275
Is not death in my house	8.950287696000958
Oh sir exclaimed the baroness you are without pity for others well then I tell you they will have no mercy on you	47.185883691675755
Be it so said Villefort raising his arms to heaven with a threatening gesture	21.661215485518344
At least delay the trial till the next assizes we shall then have six months before us	45.25800177605171
No madame said Villefort instructions have been given	43.67729701414907
There are yet five days left five days are more than I require	65.98572609550709
Do you not think that I also long for forgetfulness While working night and day I sometimes lose all recollection of the past and then I experience the same sort of happiness I can imagine the dead feel still it is better than suffering	153.88424924067257
But sir he has fled let him escapeinaction is a pardonable offence	1634.6246602217484
I tell you it is too late early this morning the telegraph was employed and at this very minute	83.04745394140348
Sir said the valet de chambre entering the room a dragoon has brought this despatch from the Minister of the Interior	84.94816600667122
Villefort seized the letter and hastily broke the seal	453.2362865201212
Madame Danglars trembled with fear Villefort started with joy	77.06350974434692
Arrested he exclaimed he was taken at Compigne and all is over	156.09405430492842
Madame Danglars rose from her seat pale and cold	22.162446043197974
Adieu madame replied the kings attorney as in an almost joyful manner he conducted her to the door	53.41343673440866
Then turning to his desk he said striking the letter with the back of his right hand	26.466945144944585
Come I had a forgery three robberies and two cases of arson I only wanted a murder and here it is	204.96984123004157
It will be a splendid session	204779.80354010183
As the procureur had told Madame Danglars Valentine was not yet recovered	39.17852958727571
Bowed down with fatigue she was indeed confined to her bed and it was in her own room and from the lips of Madame de Villefort that she heard all the strange events we have related we mean the flight of Eugnie and the arrest of Andrea Cavalcanti or rather Benedetto together with the accusation of murder pronounced against him	48.36336012361509
But Valentine was so weak that this recital scarcely produced the same effect it would have done had she been in her usual state of health	79.41591164852761
Indeed her brain was only the seat of vague ideas and confused forms mingled with strange fancies alone presented themselves before her eyes	204.51758495060557
During the daytime Valentines perceptions remained tolerably clear owing to the constant presence of M	140.60792947291938
Noirtier who caused himself to be carried to his granddaughters room and watched her with his paternal tenderness Villefort also on his return from the law courts frequently passed an hour or two with his father and child	121.29295654388902
At six oclock Villefort retired to his study at eight M	55.89428487635516
dAvrigny himself arrived bringing the night draught prepared for the young girl and then M	105.67493708838019
A nurse of the doctors choice succeeded them and never left till about ten or eleven oclock when Valentine was asleep	149.387300451626
As she went downstairs she gave the keys of Valentines room to M	51.63849444775603
de Villefort so that no one could reach the sickroom excepting through that of Madame de Villefort and little Edward	93.24783047534173
Every morning Morrel called on Noirtier to receive news of Valentine and extraordinary as it seemed each day found him less uneasy	161.48805465189054
Certainly though Valentine still labored under dreadful nervous excitement she was better and moreover Monte Cristo had told him when half distracted he had rushed to the counts house that if she were not dead in two hours she would be saved	114.54097870303157
Now four days had elapsed and Valentine still lived	226.5465509140892
The nervous excitement of which we speak pursued Valentine even in her sleep or rather in that state of somnolence which succeeded her waking hours it was then in the silence of night in the dim light shed from the alabaster lamp on the chimneypiece that she saw the shadows pass and repass which hover over the bed of sickness and fan the fever with their trembling wings	99.23337432571365
First she fancied she saw her stepmother threatening her then Morrel stretched his arms towards her sometimes mere strangers like the Count of Monte Cristo came to visit her even the very furniture in these moments of delirium seemed to move and this state lasted till about three oclock in the morning when a deep heavy slumber overcame the young girl from which she did not awake till daylight	68.68331854394219
On the evening of the day on which Valentine had learned of the flight of Eugnie and the arrest of BenedettoVillefort having retired as well as Noirtier and dAvrignyher thoughts wandered in a confused maze alternately reviewing her own situation and the events she had just heard	153.65624945747413
The nurse having placed the beverage prepared by the doctor within reach of the patient and locked the door was listening with terror to the comments of the servants in the kitchen and storing her memory with all the horrible stories which had for some months past amused the occupants of the antechambers in the house of the kings attorney	62.51164830607432
Meanwhile an unexpected scene was passing in the room which had been so carefully locked	25.39178492981583
Ten minutes had elapsed since the nurse had left Valentine who for the last hour had been suffering from the fever which returned nightly incapable of controlling her ideas was forced to yield to the excitement which exhausted itself in producing and reproducing a succession and recurrence of the same fancies and images	143.1836273351715
The nightlamp threw out countless rays each resolving itself into some strange form to her disordered imagination when suddenly by its flickering light Valentine thought she saw the door of her library which was in the recess by the chimneypiece open slowly though she in vain listened for the sound of the hinges on which it turned	100.53802644882563
At any other time Valentine would have seized the silken bellpull and summoned assistance but nothing astonished her in her present situation	264.6734150758689
Her reason told her that all the visions she beheld were but the children of her imagination and the conviction was strengthened by the fact that in the morning no traces remained of the nocturnal phantoms who disappeared with the coming of daylight	127.39347428498735
From behind the door a human figure appeared but the girl was too familiar with such apparitions to be alarmed and therefore only stared hoping to recognize Morrel	158.04880716596884
The figure advanced towards the bed and appeared to listen with profound attention	37.972801209229594
At this moment a ray of light glanced across the face of the midnight visitor	31.211871649265845
It is not he she murmured and waited in the assurance that this was but a dream for the man to disappear or assume some other form	88.52001345796386
Still she felt her pulse and finding it throb violently she remembered that the best method of dispelling such illusions was to drink for a draught of the beverage prepared by the doctor to allay her fever seemed to cause a reaction of the brain and for a short time she suffered less	112.51615571975184
Valentine therefore reached her hand towards the glass but as soon as her trembling arm left the bed the apparition advanced more quickly towards her and approached the young girl so closely that she fancied she heard his breath and felt the pressure of his hand	41.77715547990068
This time the illusion or rather the reality surpassed anything Valentine had before experienced she began to believe herself really alive and awake and the belief that her reason was this time not deceived made her shudder	183.3494643146877
The pressure she felt was evidently intended to arrest her arm and she slowly withdrew it	83.40151340382981
Then the figure from whom she could not detach her eyes and who appeared more protecting than menacing took the glass and walking towards the nightlight held it up as if to test its transparency	102.03019623451414
This did not seem sufficient the man or rather the ghostfor he trod so softly that no sound was heardthen poured out about a spoonful into the glass and drank it	129.18899103342213
Valentine witnessed this scene with a sentiment of stupefaction	52.99725520202284
Every minute she had expected that it would vanish and give place to another vision but the man instead of dissolving like a shadow again approached her and said in an agitated voice Now you may drink	122.97236038099844
It was the first time one of these visions had ever addressed her in a living voice and she was about to utter an exclamation	50.14557574029337
The man placed his finger on her lips	16.913916793865553
The Count of Monte Cristo she murmured	192.0129611516787
It was easy to see that no doubt now remained in the young girls mind as to the reality of the scene her eyes started with terror her hands trembled and she rapidly drew the bedclothes closer to her	59.65384769969054
Still the presence of Monte Cristo at such an hour his mysterious fanciful and extraordinary entrance into her room through the wall might well seem impossibilities to her shattered reason	159.36130752272214
Do not call anyonedo not be alarmed said the count do not let a shade of suspicion or uneasiness remain in your breast the man standing before you Valentine for this time it is no ghost is nothing more than the tenderest father and the most respectful friend you could dream of	77.9592822268329
Valentine could not reply the voice which indicated the real presence of a being in the room alarmed her so much that she feared to utter a syllable still the expression of her eyes seemed to inquire If your intentions are pure why are you here The counts marvellous sagacity understood all that was passing in the young girls mind	83.77184030412754
Listen to me he said or rather look upon me look at my face paler even than usual and my eyes red with wearinessfor four days I have not closed them for I have been constantly watching you to protect and preserve you for Maximilian	80.78051241192478
The blood mounted rapidly to the cheeks of Valentine for the name just announced by the count dispelled all the fear with which his presence had inspired her	77.85442302758126
Maximilian she exclaimed and so sweet did the sound appear to her that she repeated itMaximilianhas he then owned all to you	151.21999236389726
He told me your life was his and I have promised him that you shall live	34.13389078373274
You have promised him that I shall live	11.753294923038878
But sir you spoke of vigilance and protection	2023.5274002687931
Yes the best you could have at the present time believe me	80.87951121603783
But you say you have watched said Valentine uneasily where have you beenI have not seen you	168.89086410598196
The count extended his hand towards the library	51.24008653960172
I was hidden behind that door he said which leads into the next house which I have rented	100.88245524145304
Valentine turned her eyes away and with an indignant expression of pride and modest fear exclaimed	82.04690250906386
Sir I think you have been guilty of an unparalleled intrusion and that what you call protection is more like an insult	183.97240475633987
Valentine he answered during my long watch over you all I have observed has been what people visited you what nourishment was prepared and what beverage was served then when the latter appeared dangerous to me I entered as I have now done and substituted in the place of the poison a healthful draught which instead of producing the death intended caused life to circulate in your veins	153.19470487866718
Poisondeath exclaimed Valentine half believing herself under the influence of some feverish hallucination what are you saying sir	123.88860149088502
Hush my child said Monte Cristo again placing his finger upon her lips I did say poison and death	62.87012773377232
But drink some of this and the count took a bottle from his pocket containing a red liquid of which he poured a few drops into the glass	21.20377117874482
Drink this and then take nothing more tonight	431.4158143590631
Valentine stretched out her hand but scarcely had she touched the glass when she drew back in fear	54.89245352254638
Monte Cristo took the glass drank half its contents and then presented it to Valentine who smiled and swallowed the rest	61.23573317669811
Oh yes she exclaimed I recognize the flavor of my nocturnal beverage which refreshed me so much and seemed to ease my aching brain	232.28376947808957
This is how you have lived during the last four nights Valentine said the count	38.30008851677535
But oh how I passed that time Oh the wretched hours I have enduredthe torture to which I have submitted when I saw the deadly poison poured into your glass and how I trembled lest you should drink it before I could find time to throw it away	82.70068587774382
Sir said Valentine at the height of her terror you say you endured tortures when you saw the deadly poison poured into my glass but if you saw this you must also have seen the person who poured it	87.19548134304993
Valentine raised herself in bed and drew over her chest which appeared whiter than snow the embroidered cambric still moist with the cold dews of delirium to which were now added those of terror	141.8285154418586
You saw the person repeated the young girl	14.126511055951829
What you tell me is horrible sir	457.1226974568778
You wish to make me believe something too dreadful	147.3592071060861
Whatattempt to murder me in my fathers house in my room on my bed of sickness Oh leave me sir you are tempting meyou make me doubt the goodness of Providenceit is impossible it can not be	62.30782869344064
Are you the first that this hand has stricken Have you not seen M	184.09248854635115
de SaintMran Madame de SaintMran Barrois all fall Would not M	853.5283184772559
Noirtier also have fallen a victim had not the treatment he has been pursuing for the last three years neutralized the effects of the poison	62.55886302836442
Oh Heaven said Valentine is this the reason why grandpapa has made me share all his beverages during the last month	94.4205650592171
And have they all tasted of a slightly bitter flavor like that of dried orangepeel	408.7883064673755
Then that explains all said Monte Cristo	2.067624232030826
Your grandfather knows then that a poisoner lives here perhaps he even suspects the person	543.9675732012694
He has been fortifying you his beloved child against the fatal effects of the poison which has failed because your system was already impregnated with it	123.9265151319795
But even this would have availed little against a more deadly medium of death employed four days ago which is generally but too fatal	224.27331893806388
But who then is this assassin this murderer	1413.364161707014
Let me also ask you a question	56.920879020347826
Have you never seen anyone enter your room at night	49.85809308162088
Oh yes I have frequently seen shadows pass close to me approach and disappear but I took them for visions raised by my feverish imagination and indeed when you entered I thought I was under the influence of delirium	137.90100814834966
Then you do not know who it is that attempts your life	90.82980629281371
No said Valentine who could desire my death	210.05679279704208
You shall know it now then said Monte Cristo listening	18.49727886429863
How do you mean said Valentine looking anxiously around	66.58148161555023
Because you are not feverish or delirious tonight but thoroughly awake midnight is striking which is the hour murderers choose	561.7660193928954
Oh heavens exclaimed Valentine wiping off the drops which ran down her forehead	46.607083874156444
Midnight struck slowly and sadly every hour seemed to strike with leaden weight upon the heart of the poor girl	59.218532302702165
Valentine said the count summon up all your courage still the beatings of your heart do not let a sound escape you and feign to be asleep then you will see	74.63721910037285
I think I hear a noise she said leave me	92.3489138226481
Goodbye for the present replied the count walking upon tiptoe towards the library door and smiling with an expression so sad and paternal that the young girls heart was filled with gratitude	36.30937460852628
Before closing the door he turned around once more and said Not a movementnot a word let them think you asleep or perhaps you may be killed before I have the power of helping you	110.20770318498408
And with this fearful injunction the count disappeared through the door which noiselessly closed after him	31.51273817786466
Valentine was alone two other clocks slower than that of SaintPhilippeduRoule struck the hour of midnight from different directions and excepting the rumbling of a few carriages all was silent	286.0196485493975
Then Valentines attention was engrossed by the clock in her room which marked the seconds	51.39344665375699
She began counting them remarking that they were much slower than the beatings of her heart and still she doubtedthe inoffensive Valentine could not imagine that anyone should desire her death	123.92551986658391
Why should they To what end What had she done to excite the malice of an enemy	65.59593064830078
There was no fear of her falling asleep	162.19837766518125
One terrible idea pressed upon her mindthat someone existed in the world who had attempted to assassinate her and who was about to endeavor to do so again	54.91405649182841
Supposing this person wearied at the inefficacy of the poison should as Monte Cristo intimated have recourse to steelWhat if the count should have no time to run to her rescueWhat if her last moments were approaching and she should never again see Morrel	111.9634157717178
When this terrible chain of ideas presented itself Valentine was nearly persuaded to ring the bell and call for help	120.69821329146438
But through the door she fancied she saw the luminous eye of the countthat eye which lived in her memory and the recollection overwhelmed her with so much shame that she asked herself whether any amount of gratitude could ever repay his adventurous and devoted friendship	124.94518584404187
Twenty minutes twenty tedious minutes passed thus then ten more and at last the clock struck the halfhour	137.22580718415395
Just then the sound of fingernails slightly grating against the door of the library informed Valentine that the count was still watching and recommended her to do the same at the same time on the opposite side that is towards Edwards room Valentine fancied that she heard the creaking of the floor she listened attentively holding her breath till she was nearly suffocated the lock turned and the door slowly opened	82.04371506434418
Valentine had raised herself upon her elbow and had scarcely time to throw herself down on the bed and shade her eyes with her arm then trembling agitated and her heart beating with indescribable terror she awaited the event	56.8261878193145
Someone approached the bed and drew back the curtains	19.682493050530358
Valentine summoned every effort and breathed with that regular respiration which announces tranquil sleep	1562.1240642560497
The girl shuddered to the heart but did not reply	43.860299815488645
Still silent Valentine had promised not to wake	133.45341897905084
Then everything was still excepting that Valentine heard the almost noiseless sound of some liquid being poured into the glass she had just emptied	106.72566485755239
Then she ventured to open her eyelids and glance over her extended arm	82.69630581215819
She saw a woman in a white dressinggown pouring a liquor from a phial into her glass	78.94572144807066
During this short time Valentine must have held her breath or moved in some slight degree for the woman disturbed stopped and leaned over the bed in order the better to ascertain whether Valentine slept it was Madame de Villefort	66.22024952026472
On recognizing her stepmother Valentine could not repress a shudder which caused a vibration in the bed	76.24128500972712
Madame de Villefort instantly stepped back close to the wall and there shaded by the bedcurtains she silently and attentively watched the slightest movement of Valentine	85.50227718270276
The latter recollected the terrible caution of Monte Cristo she fancied that the hand not holding the phial clasped a long sharp knife	96.8011286914911
Then collecting all her remaining strength she forced herself to close her eyes but this simple operation upon the most delicate organs of our frame generally so easy to accomplish became almost impossible at this moment so much did curiosity struggle to retain the eyelid open and learn the truth	166.98488446802227
Madame de Villefort however reassured by the silence which was alone disturbed by the regular breathing of Valentine again extended her hand and half hidden by the curtains succeeded in emptying the contents of the phial into the glass	47.07283234655164
Then she retired so gently that Valentine did not know she had left the room	19.500182133657646
She only witnessed the withdrawal of the armthe fair round arm of a woman but twentyfive years old and who yet spread death around her	129.19504341974263
It is impossible to describe the sensations experienced by Valentine during the minute and a half Madame de Villefort remained in the room	60.592676598771355
The grating against the librarydoor aroused the young girl from the stupor in which she was plunged and which almost amounted to insensibility	109.1873158739526
She raised her head with an effort	13.487640382364324
The noiseless door again turned on its hinges and the Count of Monte Cristo reappeared	12.224742115687766
Well said he do you still doubt	200.21823746970372
Oh yes she said I saw but I can not believe	30.786531131060556
Would you rather die then and cause Maximilians death	925.5297844056136
Oh repeated the young girl almost bewildered can I not leave the housecan I not escape	242.17078618765487
Valentine the hand which now threatens you will pursue you everywhere your servants will be seduced with gold and death will be offered to you disguised in every shape	98.53341299489506
You will find it in the water you drink from the spring in the fruit you pluck from the tree	104.11547587887529
But did you not say that my kind grandfathers precaution had neutralized the poison	392.36272245767833
Yes but not against a strong dose the poison will be changed and the quantity increased	272.35966595978573
He took the glass and raised it to his lips	9.993451437576434
It is already done he said brucine is no longer employed but a simple narcotic I can recognize the flavor of the alcohol in which it has been dissolved	104.62706462487375
If you had taken what Madame de Villefort has poured into your glass ValentineValentineyou would have been doomed	52.52568526156855
But exclaimed the young girl why am I thus pursued	203.5084526761324
Whyare you so kindso goodso unsuspicious of ill that you can not understand Valentine	153.49489961616916
No I have never injured her	86.98522672776576
But you are rich Valentine you have 200000 livres a year and you prevent her son from enjoying these 200000 livres	127.48394826266723
How so The fortune is not her gift but is inherited from my relations	297.4340980891117
Certainly and that is why M	90.6557701020617
and Madame de SaintMran have died that is why M	119.98086223490462
Noirtier was sentenced the day he made you his heir that is why you in your turn are to dieit is because your father would inherit your property and your brother his only son succeed to his	122.96532347480618
Edward Poor child Are all these crimes committed on his account	50.00551683628512
Ah then you at length understand	518.2648338672149
Heaven grant that this may not be visited upon him	49.05435738019875
But why is my grandfather allowed to live	115.78649398422588
It was considered that you dead the fortune would naturally revert to your brother unless he were disinherited and besides the crime appearing useless it would be folly to commit it	170.17537929040458
And is it possible that this frightful combination of crimes has been invented by a woman	97.8209990137179
Do you recollect in the arbor of the Htel des Postes at Perugia seeing a man in a brown cloak whom your stepmother was questioning upon aqua tofana Well ever since then the infernal project has been ripening in her brain	161.84839449568196
Ah then indeed sir said the sweet girl bathed in tears I see that I am condemned to die	32.6101037699366
No Valentine for I have foreseen all their plots no your enemy is conquered since we know her and you will live Valentinelive to be happy yourself and to confer happiness upon a noble heart but to insure this you must rely on me	140.38686721751313
Command me sirwhat am I to do	19.727085745300126
You must blindly take what I give you	17.014045879805256
Alas were it only for my own sake I should prefer to die	30.81894339917233
You must not confide in anyonenot even in your father	382.62736811723636
My father is not engaged in this fearful plot is he sir asked Valentine clasping her hands	88.61429543538746
No and yet your father a man accustomed to judicial accusations ought to have known that all these deaths have not happened naturally it is he who should have watched over youhe should have occupied my placehe should have emptied that glasshe should have risen against the assassin	138.85032555865962
Spectre against spectre he murmured in a low voice as he concluded his sentence	31.246112807485094
Sir said Valentine I will do all I can to live for there are two beings who love me and will die if I diemy grandfather and Maximilian	64.77489107370349
I will watch over them as I have over you	28.375330261302604
Well sir do as you will with me and then she added in a low voice oh heavens what will befall me	36.38932110412105
Whatever may happen Valentine do not be alarmed though you suffer though you lose sight hearing consciousness fear nothing though you should awake and be ignorant where you are still do not fear even though you should find yourself in a sepulchral vault or coffin	128.31101394040198
Reassure yourself then and say to yourself At this moment a friend a father who lives for my happiness and that of Maximilian watches over me	64.55649829679557
Alas alas what a fearful extremity	6760.59224943124
Valentine would you rather denounce your stepmother	137.40242490873774
I would rather die a hundred timesoh yes die	650.2475236443362
No you will not die but will you promise me whatever happens that you will not complain but hope	67.96298614733166
You are my own darling child Valentine I alone can save you and I will	37.21654953875083
Valentine in the extremity of her terror joined her handsfor she felt that the moment had arrived to ask for courageand began to pray and while uttering little more than incoherent words she forgot that her white shoulders had no other covering than her long hair and that the pulsations of her heart could be seen through the lace of her nightdress	115.3607570063886
Monte Cristo gently laid his hand on the young girls arm drew the velvet coverlet close to her throat and said with a paternal smile	25.80837278389745
My child believe in my devotion to you as you believe in the goodness of Providence and the love of Maximilian	53.52752963332548
Valentine gave him a look full of gratitude and remained as docile as a child	51.46105335700631
Then he drew from his waistcoatpocket the little emerald box raised the golden lid and took from it a pastille about the size of a pea which he placed in her hand	88.05631921765747
She took it and looked attentively on the count there was an expression on the face of her intrepid protector which commanded her veneration	61.626917879353144
She evidently interrogated him by her look	144.2267094376284
Valentine carried the pastille to her mouth and swallowed it	45.29177260407034
And now my dear child adieu for the present	69.08892329178978
I will try and gain a little sleep for you are saved	36.13618488811742
Go said Valentine whatever happens I promise you not to fear	21.260534623403398
Monte Cristo for some time kept his eyes fixed on the young girl who gradually fell asleep yielding to the effects of the narcotic the count had given her	35.59596494052239
Then he took the glass emptied three parts of the contents in the fireplace that it might be supposed Valentine had taken it and replaced it on the table then he disappeared after throwing a farewell glance on Valentine who slept with the confidence and innocence of an angel at the feet of the Lord	57.38230633919527
The nightlight continued to burn on the chimneypiece exhausting the last drops of oil which floated on the surface of the water	62.6086335231428
The globe of the lamp appeared of a reddish hue and the flame brightening before it expired threw out the last flickerings which in an inanimate object have been so often compared with the convulsions of a human creature in its final agonies	100.04305099716981
A dull and dismal light was shed over the bedclothes and curtains surrounding the young girl	70.19809544848574
All noise in the streets had ceased and the silence was frightful	73.64665084875541
It was then that the door of Edwards room opened and a head we have before noticed appeared in the glass opposite it was Madame de Villefort who came to witness the effects of the drink she had prepared	48.15211556425851
She stopped in the doorway listened for a moment to the flickering of the lamp the only sound in that deserted room and then advanced to the table to see if Valentines glass were empty	64.96586424786261
It was still about a quarter full as we before stated	225.42091452379475
Madame de Villefort emptied the contents into the ashes which she disturbed that they might the more readily absorb the liquid then she carefully rinsed the glass and wiping it with her handkerchief replaced it on the table	90.26787891752453
If anyone could have looked into the room just then he would have noticed the hesitation with which Madame de Villefort approached the bed and looked fixedly on Valentine	38.0497311906646
The dim light the profound silence and the gloomy thoughts inspired by the hour and still more by her own conscience all combined to produce a sensation of fear the poisoner was terrified at the contemplation of her own work	82.59028167752734
At length she rallied drew aside the curtain and leaning over the pillow gazed intently on Valentine	31.396970616509883
The young girl no longer breathed no breath issued through the halfclosed teeth the white lips no longer quiveredthe eyes were suffused with a bluish vapor and the long black lashes rested on a cheek white as wax	159.4700875813596
Madame de Villefort gazed upon the face so expressive even in its stillness then she ventured to raise the coverlet and press her hand upon the young girls heart	68.37305739467898
She only felt the pulsation in her own fingers and withdrew her hand with a shudder	29.728774630500848
One arm was hanging out of the bed from shoulder to elbow it was moulded after the arms of Germain Pillons Graces23 but the forearm seemed to be slightly distorted by convulsion and the hand so delicately formed was resting with stiff outstretched fingers on the framework of the bed	165.9079329878426
The nails too were turning blue	35063.34146140957
Madame de Villefort had no longer any doubt all was overshe had consummated the last terrible work she had to accomplish	142.69380247307242
There was no more to do in the room so the poisoner retired stealthily as though fearing to hear the sound of her own footsteps but as she withdrew she still held aside the curtain absorbed in the irresistible attraction always exerted by the picture of death so long as it is merely mysterious and does not excite disgust	114.30265146287441
The minutes passed Madame de Villefort could not drop the curtain which she held like a funeral pall over the head of Valentine	39.84936542882265
She was lost in reverie and the reverie of crime is remorse	103.44418165368107
Just then the lamp again flickered the noise startled Madame de Villefort who shuddered and dropped the curtain	88.69091772758232
Immediately afterwards the light expired and the room was plunged in frightful obscurity while the clock at that minute struck halfpast four	135.81403841863576
Overpowered with agitation the poisoner succeeded in groping her way to the door and reached her room in an agony of fear	53.54151460660903
The darkness lasted two hours longer then by degrees a cold light crept through the Venetian blinds until at length it revealed the objects in the room	68.54259635104957
About this time the nurses cough was heard on the stairs and the woman entered the room with a cup in her hand	30.38035673199645
To the tender eye of a father or a lover the first glance would have sufficed to reveal Valentines condition but to this hireling Valentine only appeared to sleep	173.5741793906281
Good she exclaimed approaching the table she has taken part of her draught the glass is threequarters empty	164.01588976891873
Then she went to the fireplace and lit the fire and although she had just left her bed she could not resist the temptation offered by Valentines sleep so she threw herself into an armchair to snatch a little more rest	70.06656147919203
The clock striking eight awoke her	281.3262205198065
Astonished at the prolonged slumber of the patient and frightened to see that the arm was still hanging out of the bed she advanced towards Valentine and for the first time noticed the white lips	30.655000708957665
She tried to replace the arm but it moved with a frightful rigidity which could not deceive a sicknurse	123.11467466567834
She screamed aloud then running to the door exclaimed	24.826741637560435
What is the matter asked M	63.751552334561595
dAvrigny at the foot of the stairs it being the hour he usually visited her	107.49860133102473
What is it asked Villefort rushing from his room	58.32038070671274
Doctor do you hear them call for help	95.39377075305109
Yes yes let us hasten up it was in Valentines room	68.07429627474305
But before the doctor and the father could reach the room the servants who were on the same floor had entered and seeing Valentine pale and motionless on her bed they lifted up their hands towards heaven and stood transfixed as though struck by lightening	47.02924610951449
Call Madame de VillefortWake Madame de Villefort cried the procureur from the door of his chamber which apparently he scarcely dared to leave	33.642487749338265
But instead of obeying him the servants stood watching M	264.84980289023054
dAvrigny who ran to Valentine and raised her in his arms	18.097368057786614
Oh where will be the end	100.95005915947189
What are you saying doctor he exclaimed raising his hands to heaven	23.938200477060867
I say that Valentine is dead replied dAvrigny in a voice terrible in its solemn calmness	54.10573990192109
de Villefort staggered and buried his head in the bed	14.16614643555815
On the exclamation of the doctor and the cry of the father the servants all fled with muttered imprecations they were heard running down the stairs and through the long passages then there was a rush in the court afterwards all was still they had one and all deserted the accursed house	110.7174068161536
Just then Madame de Villefort in the act of slipping on her dressinggown threw aside the drapery and for a moment stood motionless as though interrogating the occupants of the room while she endeavored to call up some rebellious tears	73.17895085458701
On a sudden she stepped or rather bounded with outstretched arms towards the table	55.33561574559711
She saw dAvrigny curiously examining the glass which she felt certain of having emptied during the night	41.63501872635801
It was now a third full just as it was when she threw the contents into the ashes	57.96228825425553
The spectre of Valentine rising before the poisoner would have alarmed her less	110.66968867689955
It was indeed the same color as the draught she had poured into the glass and which Valentine had drunk it was indeed the poison which could not deceive M	45.89874845864065
dAvrigny which he now examined so closely it was doubtless a miracle from heaven that notwithstanding her precautions there should be some trace some proof remaining to reveal the crime	180.54691788549815
While Madame de Villefort remained rooted to the spot like a statue of terror and Villefort with his head hidden in the bedclothes saw nothing around him dAvrigny approached the window that he might the better examine the contents of the glass and dipping the tip of his finger in tasted it	79.4807229998719
Ah he exclaimed it is no longer brucine that is used let me see what it is	44.82764160314205
Then he ran to one of the cupboards in Valentines room which had been transformed into a medicine closet and taking from its silver case a small bottle of nitric acid dropped a little of it into the liquor which immediately changed to a bloodred color	133.66840552523303
Ah exclaimed dAvrigny in a voice in which the horror of a judge unveiling the truth was mingled with the delight of a student making a discovery	86.15332467335172
Madame de Villefort was overpowered her eyes first flashed and then swam she staggered towards the door and disappeared	81.45900316440385
Directly afterwards the distant sound of a heavy weight falling on the ground was heard but no one paid any attention to it the nurse was engaged in watching the chemical analysis and Villefort was still absorbed in grief	67.50654518439359
dAvrigny alone had followed Madame de Villefort with his eyes and watched her hurried retreat	39.78958029465889
He lifted up the drapery over the entrance to Edwards room and his eye reaching as far as Madame de Villeforts apartment he beheld her extended lifeless on the floor	54.21836000084009
Go to the assistance of Madame de Villefort he said to the nurse	18.869497967977743
But Mademoiselle de Villefort stammered the nurse	73.58891906356513
Mademoiselle de Villefort no longer requires help said dAvrigny since she is dead	82.79062335837041
Deaddead groaned forth Villefort in a paroxysm of grief which was the more terrible from the novelty of the sensation in the iron heart of that man	41.404116275824244
The two men turned round and saw Morrel standing at the door pale and terrorstricken	30.788246555781996
At the usual time Morrel had presented himself at the little door leading to Noirtiers room	24.888810220242814
Contrary to custom the door was open and having no occasion to ring he entered	58.031259485839726
He waited for a moment in the hall and called for a servant to conduct him to M	32.00241187118103
Noirtier but no one answered the servants having as we know deserted the house	78.13859088548058
Morrel had no particular reason for uneasiness Monte Cristo had promised him that Valentine should live and so far he had always fulfilled his word	57.572694659835726
Every night the count had given him news which was the next morning confirmed by Noirtier	83.35763179145741
Still this extraordinary silence appeared strange to him and he called a second and third time still no answer	85.3403726194145
Then he determined to go up	13.423216963743691
Noirtiers room was opened like all the rest	26.67801987273166
The first thing he saw was the old man sitting in his armchair in his usual place but his eyes expressed alarm which was confirmed by the pallor which overspread his features	45.611675664215106
How are you sir asked Morrel with a sickness of heart	33.40149011270644
Well answered the old man by closing his eyes but his appearance manifested increasing uneasiness	176.47474296759518
You are thoughtful sir continued Morrel you want something shall I call one of the servants	33.52068741225658
Morrel pulled the bell but though he nearly broke the cord no one answered	70.2092849219239
He turned towards Noirtier the pallor and anguish expressed on his countenance momentarily increased	143.471738490143
Oh exclaimed Morrel why do they not come Is anyone ill in the house The eyes of Noirtier seemed as though they would start from their sockets	56.30580396018885
What is the matter You alarm me	154.25554915139264
Maximilian tried to speak but he could articulate nothing he staggered and supported himself against the wainscot	180.33524354012476
Then he pointed to the door	36.93517089846948
Yes yes yes continued the old man	6.5083170768030145
Maximilian rushed up the little staircase while Noirtiers eyes seemed to sayQuicker quicker	191.9621476715896
In a minute the young man darted through several rooms till at length he reached Valentines	57.95341745861509
There was no occasion to push the door it was wide open	46.621843038764816
A sob was the only sound he heard	19.199633778857468
He saw as though in a mist a black figure kneeling and buried in a confused mass of white drapery	114.9630045627763
It was then he heard a voice exclaim Valentine is dead and another voice which like an echo repeated	169.28412165495766
Villefort rose halfashamed of being surprised in such a paroxysm of grief	32.62082483502014
The terrible office he had held for twentyfive years had succeeded in making him more or less than man	82.5184683000284
His glance at first wandering fixed itself upon Morrel	156.99903589834736
Who are you sir he asked that forget that this is not the manner to enter a house stricken with death Go sir go	94.8100362520685
But Morrel remained motionless he could not detach his eyes from that disordered bed and the pale corpse of the young girl who was lying on it	49.65010781640443
Godo you hear said Villefort while dAvrigny advanced to lead Morrel out	196.30119940683514
Maximilian stared for a moment at the corpse gazed all around the room then upon the two men he opened his mouth to speak but finding it impossible to give utterance to the innumerable ideas that occupied his brain he went out thrusting his hands through his hair in such a manner that Villefort and dAvrigny for a moment diverted from the engrossing topic exchanged glances which seemed to sayHe is mad	83.97539591254116
But in less than five minutes the staircase groaned beneath an extraordinary weight	292.07384869808016
Morrel was seen carrying with superhuman strength the armchair containing Noirtier upstairs	983.3211409824218
When he reached the landing he placed the armchair on the floor and rapidly rolled it into Valentines room	32.40131930845857
This could only have been accomplished by means of unnatural strength supplied by powerful excitement	279.1618537811115
But the most fearful spectacle was Noirtier being pushed towards the bed his face expressing all his meaning and his eyes supplying the want of every other faculty	96.66562372622685
That pale face and flaming glance appeared to Villefort like a frightful apparition	86.73341086256886
Each time he had been brought into contact with his father something terrible had happened	111.63850719553427
See what they have done cried Morrel with one hand leaning on the back of the chair and the other extended towards Valentine	24.422067274752376
Villefort drew back and looked with astonishment on the young man who almost a stranger to him called Noirtier his father	42.19026062898556
At this moment the whole soul of the old man seemed centred in his eyes which became bloodshot the veins of the throat swelled his cheeks and temples became purple as though he was struck with epilepsy nothing was wanting to complete this but the utterance of a cry	78.31175078937116
And the cry issued from his pores if we may thus speaka cry frightful in its silence	375.05033233864214
DAvrigny rushed towards the old man and made him inhale a powerful restorative	177.93745184775364
Sir cried Morrel seizing the moist hand of the paralytic they ask me who I am and what right I have to be here	42.951441806431134
Oh you know it tell them tell them And the young mans voice was choked by sobs	95.36887539428784
As for the old man his chest heaved with his panting respiration	281.5344071021988
One could have thought that he was undergoing the agonies preceding death	600.9955314679295
At length happier than the young man who sobbed without weeping tears glistened in the eyes of Noirtier	45.13781680778376
Tell them said Morrel in a hoarse voice tell them that I am her betrothed	42.821085114927534
Tell them she was my beloved my noble girl my only blessing in the world	112.19650806122806
Tell themoh tell them that corpse belongs to me	202.05546755959017
The young man overwhelmed by the weight of his anguish fell heavily on his knees before the bed which his fingers grasped with convulsive energy	45.0451501851325
DAvrigny unable to bear the sight of this touching emotion turned away and Villefort without seeking any further explanation and attracted towards him by the irresistible magnetism which draws us towards those who have loved the people for whom we mourn extended his hand towards the young man	90.02204574019338
But Morrel saw nothing he had grasped the hand of Valentine and unable to weep vented his agony in groans as he bit the sheets	123.8446729426652
For some time nothing was heard in that chamber but sobs exclamations and prayers	224.57381826769966
At length Villefort the most composed of all spoke	349.7212204323768
Sir said he to Maximilian you say you loved Valentine that you were betrothed to her	107.74933004050041
I knew nothing of this engagement of this love yet I her father forgive you for I see that your grief is real and deep and besides my own sorrow is too great for anger to find a place in my heart	69.68664298030428
But you see that the angel whom you hoped for has left this earthshe has nothing more to do with the adoration of men	106.79085272311106
Take a last farewell sir of her sad remains take the hand you expected to possess once more within your own and then separate yourself from her forever	168.1198793809625
Valentine now requires only the ministrations of the priest	121.89634331576123
You are mistaken sir exclaimed Morrel raising himself on one knee his heart pierced by a more acute pang than any he had yet feltyou are mistaken Valentine dying as she has not only requires a priest but an avenger	116.78145085740982
de Villefort send for the priest I will be the avenger	102.35990236215096
What do you mean sir asked Villefort trembling at the new idea inspired by the delirium of Morrel	50.50052085040236
I tell you sir that two persons exist in you the father has mourned sufficiently now let the procureur fulfil his office	289.5096433993674
The eyes of Noirtier glistened and dAvrigny approached	55.596078014131784
Gentlemen said Morrel reading all that passed through the minds of the witnesses to the scene I know what I am saying and you know as well as I do what I am about to sayValentine has been assassinated	31.626767484692223
Villefort hung his head dAvrigny approached nearer and Noirtier said Yes with his eyes	117.91859933570028
Now sir continued Morrel in these days no one can disappear by violent means without some inquiries being made as to the cause of her disappearance even were she not a young beautiful and adorable creature like Valentine	118.11644465085021
le Procureur du Roi said Morrel with increasing vehemence no mercy is allowed I denounce the crime it is your place to seek the assassin	77.96442977333348
The young mans implacable eyes interrogated Villefort who on his side glanced from Noirtier to dAvrigny	63.13938924484095
But instead of finding sympathy in the eyes of the doctor and his father he only saw an expression as inflexible as that of Maximilian	27.525190644632193
Sir said Villefort striving to struggle against this triple force and his own emotionsir you are deceived no one commits crimes here	258.1573081217821
It is horrible indeed but no one assassinates	325.7995260188508
The eyes of Noirtier lighted up with rage and dAvrigny prepared to speak	31.058315403865873
Morrel however extended his arm and commanded silence	696.1446983596969
And I say that murders are committed here said Morrel whose voice though lower in tone lost none of its terrible distinctness I tell you that this is the fourth victim within the last four months	79.87623969879498
I tell you Valentines life was attempted by poison four days ago though she escaped owing to the precautions of M	78.57364577417067
I tell you that the dose has been double the poison changed and that this time it has succeeded	130.72445214623272
I tell you that you know these things as well as I do since this gentleman has forewarned you both as a doctor and as a friend	40.37046200652246
Oh you rave sir exclaimed Villefort in vain endeavoring to escape the net in which he was taken	40.12355992063967
I rave said Morrel well then I appeal to M	138.7364557742961
Ask him sir if he recollects the words he uttered in the garden of this house on the night of Madame de SaintMrans death	27.21149201096089
You thought yourselves alone and talked about that tragical death and the fatality you mentioned then is the same which has caused the murder of Valentine	190.33640296465683
Yes yes continued Morrel recall the scene for the words you thought were only given to silence and solitude fell into my ears	118.49286557985413
Certainly after witnessing the culpable indolence manifested by M	899.3597827404204
de Villefort towards his own relations I ought to have denounced him to the authorities then I should not have been an accomplice to thy death as I now am sweet beloved Valentine but the accomplice shall become the avenger	91.70729104517787
This fourth murder is apparent to all and if thy father abandon thee Valentine it is I and I swear it that shall pursue the assassin	117.57753049408493
And this time as though nature had at least taken compassion on the vigorous frame nearly bursting with its own strength the words of Morrel were stifled in his throat his breast heaved the tears so long rebellious gushed from his eyes and he threw himself weeping on his knees by the side of the bed	71.97175458779668
And I too he exclaimed in a low voice I unite with M	28.00531602863897
Morrel in demanding justice for crime my blood boils at the idea of having encouraged a murderer by my cowardly concession	456.5897648685506
Morrel raised his head and reading the eyes of the old man which gleamed with unnatural lustre	84.28702603672994
Yes indicated Noirtier with an expression the more terrible from all his faculties being centred in his glance	124.3914496281482
Do you know the assassin asked Morrel	9.515472872371793
And will you direct us exclaimed the young man	14.04376347218474
Noirtier looked upon Morrel with one of those melancholy smiles which had so often made Valentine happy and thus fixed his attention	54.786993831791335
Then having riveted the eyes of his interlocutor on his own he glanced towards the door	35.57793494502944
Do you wish me to leave said Morrel sadly	67.96517367374537
Alas alas sir have pity on me	8.56267360931981
The old mans eyes remained fixed on the door	7.598855944633825
May I at least return asked Morrel	31.655338939966065
Whom am I to take with me The procureur	108.39098069572626
You wish to remain alone with M	15.042832290862641
Oh said Villefort inexpressibly delighted to think that the inquiries were to be made by him aloneoh be satisfied I can understand my father	52.743880617385635
While uttering these words with this expression of joy his teeth clashed together violently	213.47179179305115
DAvrigny took the young mans arm and led him out of the room	8.439674723995655
A more than deathlike silence then reigned in the house	76.13429985878179
At the end of a quarter of an hour a faltering footstep was heard and Villefort appeared at the door of the apartment where dAvrigny and Morrel had been staying one absorbed in meditation the other in grief	38.98109287065136
You can come he said and led them back to Noirtier	42.21815674470116
His face was livid large drops rolled down his face and in his fingers he held the fragments of a quill pen which he had torn to atoms	37.29991376624228
Gentlemen he said in a hoarse voice give me your word of honor that this horrible secret shall forever remain buried amongst ourselves The two men drew back	112.21242656027779
But said Morrel the culpritthe murdererthe assassin	15590.254747137316
Do not alarm yourself sir justice will be done said Villefort	27.55237218790371
My father has revealed the culprits name my father thirsts for revenge as much as you do yet even he conjures you as I do to keep this secret	104.05188460261316
Morrel suffered an exclamation of horror and surprise to escape him	44.87914979827506
Oh sir said Villefort arresting Maximilian by the arm if my father the inflexible man makes this request it is because he knows be assured that Valentine will be terribly revenged	128.69111290725144
The old man made a sign in the affirmative	14.076100172453417
He knows me and I have pledged my word to him	38.05063391264917
Rest assured gentlemen that within three days in a less time than justice would demand the revenge I shall have taken for the murder of my child will be such as to make the boldest heart tremble and as he spoke these words he ground his teeth and grasped the old mans senseless hand	81.05015506176014
Will this promise be fulfilled M	90.44152612626357
Noirtier asked Morrel while dAvrigny looked inquiringly	2020.4516509468383
Yes replied Noirtier with an expression of sinister joy	14.29707739163889
Swear then said Villefort joining the hands of Morrel and dAvrigny swear that you will spare the honor of my house and leave me to avenge my child	27.59051564406775
DAvrigny turned round and uttered a very feeble Yes but Morrel disengaging his hand rushed to the bed and after having pressed the cold lips of Valentine with his own hurriedly left uttering a long deep groan of despair and anguish	64.70030450158083
We have before stated that all the servants had fled	82.87168348085343
de Villefort was therefore obliged to request M	55.59677667474973
dAvrigny to superintend all the arrangements consequent upon a death in a large city more especially a death under such suspicious circumstances	229.72677114317003
It was something terrible to witness the silent agony the mute despair of Noirtier whose tears silently rolled down his cheeks	98.31053863662478
Villefort retired to his study and dAvrigny left to summon the doctor of the mayoralty whose office it is to examine bodies after decease and who is expressly named the doctor of the dead	125.15028058206026
Noirtier could not be persuaded to quit his grandchild	151.76529285509923
At the end of a quarter of an hour M	9.539582299246092
dAvrigny returned with his associate they found the outer gate closed and not a servant remaining in the house Villefort himself was obliged to open to them	84.38348414346241
But he stopped on the landing he had not the courage to again visit the death chamber	165.0564241615661
The two doctors therefore entered the room alone	22.221942884846563
Noirtier was near the bed pale motionless and silent as the corpse	35.22012781290662
The district doctor approached with the indifference of a man accustomed to spend half his time amongst the dead he then lifted the sheet which was placed over the face and just unclosed the lips	71.31998080135217
Alas said dAvrigny she is indeed dead poor child	83.87194645411036
Yes answered the doctor laconically dropping the sheet he had raised	175.66338957979582
Noirtier uttered a kind of hoarse rattling sound the old mans eyes sparkled and the good doctor understood that he wished to behold his child	77.52908156209521
He therefore approached the bed and while his companion was dipping the fingers with which he had touched the lips of the corpse in chloride of lime he uncovered the calm and pale face which looked like that of a sleeping angel	61.71527686742399
A tear which appeared in the old mans eye expressed his thanks to the doctor	21.86989917871577
The doctor of the dead then laid his permit on the corner of the table and having fulfilled his duty was conducted out by dAvrigny	85.71599959874257
Villefort met them at the door of his study having in a few words thanked the district doctor he turned to dAvrigny and said	53.263355878414416
Is there any particular priest you wish to pray with Valentine asked dAvrigny	153.49761000223756
The nearest said the district doctor is a good Italian abb who lives next door to you	124.29118606494771
Shall I call on him as I pass	49.88484860077143
DAvrigny said Villefort be so kind I beseech you as to accompany this gentleman	45.808677580110086
Here is the key of the door so that you can go in and out as you please you will bring the priest with you and will oblige me by introducing him into my childs room	51.792828456494
Do you wish to see him	7.953965630053979
I only wish to be alone	25.74239854540148
You will excuse me will you not A priest can understand a fathers grief	65.44541080873516
de Villefort giving the key to dAvrigny again bade farewell to the strange doctor and retired to his study where he began to work	63.01920227688398
For some temperaments work is a remedy for all afflictions	264.4939227061212
As the doctors entered the street they saw a man in a cassock standing on the threshold of the next door	35.2456142588928
This is the abb of whom I spoke said the doctor to dAvrigny	22.300784171822926
Sir he said are you disposed to confer a great obligation on an unhappy father who has just lost his daughter I mean M	78.70450590929167
Ah said the priest in a marked Italian accent yes I have heard that death is in that house	35.338926123238565
Then I need not tell you what kind of service he requires of you	93.59459592736326
I was about to offer myself sir said the priest it is our mission to forestall our duties	92.14493785872232
I know it sir the servants who fled from the house informed me	28.59304085730399
I also know that her name is Valentine and I have already prayed for her	41.23667859082684
Thank you sir said dAvrigny since you have commenced your sacred office deign to continue it	115.6497858224743
Come and watch by the dead and all the wretched family will be grateful to you	47.764187843230175
I am going sir and I do not hesitate to say that no prayers will be more fervent than mine	40.89135204981789
DAvrigny took the priests hand and without meeting Villefort who was engaged in his study they reached Valentines room which on the following night was to be occupied by the undertakers	47.87463177999914
On entering the room Noirtiers eyes met those of the abb and no doubt he read some particular expression in them for he remained in the room	54.540818620964565
DAvrigny recommended the attention of the priest to the living as well as to the dead and the abb promised to devote his prayers to Valentine and his attentions to Noirtier	54.03225305526724
In order doubtless that he might not be disturbed while fulfilling his sacred mission the priest rose as soon as dAvrigny departed and not only bolted the door through which the doctor had just left but also that leading to Madame de Villeforts room	59.723514016013354
The next morning dawned dull and cloudy	119.41618063066961
During the night the undertakers had executed their melancholy office and wrapped the corpse in the windingsheet which whatever may be said about the equality of death is at least a last proof of the luxury so pleasing in life	113.06605940026014
This windingsheet was nothing more than a beautiful piece of cambric which the young girl had bought a fortnight before	50.70363493205997
During the evening two men engaged for the purpose had carried Noirtier from Valentines room into his own and contrary to all expectation there was no difficulty in withdrawing him from his child	92.49350647658315
The Abb Busoni had watched till daylight and then left without calling anyone	103.7529983099632
DAvrigny returned about eight oclock in the morning he met Villefort on his way to Noirtiers room and accompanied him to see how the old man had slept	18.8142781036017
They found him in the large armchair which served him for a bed enjoying a calm nay almost a smiling sleep	144.96494656300197
They both stood in amazement at the door	4.966173821160055
See said dAvrigny to Villefort nature knows how to alleviate the deepest sorrow	284.52055150371285
No one can say that M	76.34578233916494
Noirtier did not love his child and yet he sleeps	113.5908739925631
Yes you are right replied Villefort surprised he sleeps indeed And this is the more strange since the least contradiction keeps him awake all night	210.7858339391264
Grief has stunned him replied dAvrigny and they both returned thoughtfully to the procureurs study	161.20128806442085
See I have not slept said Villefort showing his undisturbed bed grief does not stun me	187.4697566795712
I have not been in bed for two nights but then look at my desk see what I have written during these two days and nights	79.72620541196515
I have filled those papers and have made out the accusation against the assassin Benedetto	82.59593028571823
Oh work workmy passion my joy my delightit is for thee to alleviate my sorrows and he convulsively grasped the hand of dAvrigny	123.68181838999612
Do you require my services now asked dAvrigny	58.867510196210034
No said Villefort only return again at eleven oclock at twelve thetheoh Heavens my poor poor child and the procureur again becoming a man lifted up his eyes and groaned	93.81654832844156
Shall you be present in the receptionroom	710.6124338082863
No I have a cousin who has undertaken this sad office	140.0319220466822
I shall work doctorwhen I work I forget everything	288.7551796309481
And indeed no sooner had the doctor left the room than he was again absorbed in work	71.13982771533931
On the doorsteps dAvrigny met the cousin whom Villefort had mentioned a personage as insignificant in our story as in the world he occupiedone of those beings designed from their birth to make themselves useful to others	154.7632006480381
He was punctual dressed in black with crape around his hat and presented himself at his cousins with a face made up for the occasion and which he could alter as might be required	71.70053718740292
At eleven oclock the mourningcoaches rolled into the paved court and the Rue du Faubourg SaintHonor was filled with a crowd of idlers equally pleased to witness the festivities or the mourning of the rich and who rush with the same avidity to a funeral procession as to the marriage of a duchess	65.48576936477404
Gradually the receptionroom filled and some of our old friends made their appearancewe mean Debray ChteauRenaud and Beauchamp accompanied by all the leading men of the day at the bar in literature or the army for M	109.7636548230839
de Villefort moved in the first Parisian circles less owing to his social position than to his personal merit	209.61381456230035
The cousin standing at the door ushered in the guests and it was rather a relief to the indifferent to see a person as unmoved as themselves and who did not exact a mournful face or force tears as would have been the case with a father a brother or a lover	68.02551435320659
Those who were acquainted soon formed into little groups	1039.3996400123028
One of them was made of Debray ChteauRenaud and Beauchamp	59.44106702611122
Poor girl said Debray like the rest paying an involuntary tribute to the sad eventpoor girl so young so rich so beautiful Could you have imagined this scene ChteauRenaud when we saw her at the most three weeks ago about to sign that contract	121.25965916012039
I spoke to her once or twice at Madame de Morcerfs among the rest she appeared to me charming though rather melancholy	94.73404796086113
Where is her stepmother Do you know	3.674014684864885
She is spending the day with the wife of the worthy gentleman who is receiving us	39.15749482210171
The gentleman who receives us Is he a deputy	87.47103107426034
I am condemned to witness those gentlemen every day said Beauchamp but he is perfectly unknown to me	36.748016906725425
Have you mentioned this death in your paper	75.06212783535193
It has been mentioned but the article is not mine indeed I doubt if it will please M	64.11260272471539
Villefort for it says that if four successive deaths had happened anywhere else than in the house of the kings attorney he would have interested himself somewhat more about it	68.73512336203605
dAvrigny who attends my mother declares he is in despair about it	118.9254764702046
But whom are you seeking Debray	1713.0547816893493
I am seeking the Count of Monte Cristo said the young man	3.9212962695104654
I met him on the boulevard on my way here said Beauchamp	54.93649799507008
I think he is about to leave Paris he was going to his banker	37.54570281407716
His banker Danglars is his banker is he not asked ChteauRenaud of Debray	50.38312394796704
I believe so replied the secretary with slight uneasiness	202.83400664139452
But Monte Cristo is not the only one I miss here I do not see Morrel	72.73323960973714
Morrel Do they know him asked ChteauRenaud	75.58576941129175
I think he has only been introduced to Madame de Villefort	13.716279417113695
Still he ought to have been here said Debray I wonder what will be talked about tonight this funeral is the news of the day	56.58737689669793
But hush here comes our minister of justice he will feel obliged to make some little speech to the cousin and the three young men drew near to listen	51.157286989747966
Beauchamp told the truth when he said that on his way to the funeral he had met Monte Cristo who was directing his steps towards the Rue de la Chausse dAntin to M	15.785064285124152
The banker saw the carriage of the count enter the courtyard and advanced to meet him with a sad though affable smile	37.13556804472323
Well said he extending his hand to Monte Cristo I suppose you have come to sympathize with me for indeed misfortune has taken possession of my house	28.660156203058126
When I perceived you I was just asking myself whether I had not wished harm towards those poor Morcerfs which would have justified the proverb of He who wishes misfortunes to happen to others experiences them himself	223.176899608342
Well on my word of honor I answered No I wished no ill to Morcerf he was a little proud perhaps for a man who like myself has risen from nothing but we all have our faults	85.59213569204107
Do you know count that persons of our time of lifenot that you belong to the class you are still a young manbut as I was saying persons of our time of life have been very unfortunate this year	103.01469207778452
For example look at the puritanical procureur who has just lost his daughter and in fact nearly all his family in so singular a manner Morcerf dishonored and dead and then myself covered with ridicule through the villany of Benedetto besides	128.01501320876886
Good heavens what are you telling me	99.59800539572842
Oh how happy you must be in not having either wife or children	142.4248428755856
She could not endure the insult offered to us by that wretch so she asked permission to travel	142.41290170894587
But still we have quite lost our dear Eugnie for I doubt whether her pride will ever allow her to return to France	74.60066480199556
Still baron said Monte Cristo family griefs or indeed any other affliction which would crush a man whose child was his only treasure are endurable to a millionaire	195.0995493497377
Philosophers may well say and practical men will always support the opinion that money mitigates many trials and if you admit the efficacy of this sovereign balm you ought to be very easily consoledyou the king of finance the focus of immeasurable power	274.81590213622013
Danglars looked at him askance as though to ascertain whether he spoke seriously	38.415975887036545
Yes he answered if a fortune brings consolation I ought to be consoled I am rich	101.55706063210606
So rich dear sir that your fortune resembles the pyramids if you wished to demolish them you could not and if it were possible you would not dare	84.40695202430557
Danglars smiled at the goodnatured pleasantry of the count	29.0504817074969
That reminds me he said that when you entered I was on the point of signing five little bonds I have already signed two will you allow me to do the same to the others	59.822351043723145
There was a moments silence during which the noise of the bankers pen was alone heard while Monte Cristo examined the gilt mouldings on the ceiling	48.7122227685896
Are they Spanish Haitian or Neapolitan bonds said Monte Cristo	87.59368074166913
No said Danglars smiling they are bonds on the bank of France payable to bearer	74.29054066467026
Stay count he added you who may be called the emperor if I claim the title of king of finance have you many pieces of paper of this size each worth a million	98.87788035375158
The count took into his hands the papers which Danglars had so proudly presented to him and read	64.86630747980857
To the Governor of the Bank	201114.1548098891
Please pay to my order from the fund deposited by me the sum of a million and charge the same to my account	46.72125891368033
One two three four five said Monte Cristo five millionswhy what a Crsus you are	163.09228024268083
This is how I transact business said Danglars	49.51928883848106
It is really wonderful said the count above all if as I suppose it is payable at sight	101.84529878838026
It is a fine thing to have such credit really it is only in France these things are done	57.699522815048766
Five millions on five little scraps of paperit must be seen to be believed	156.87207286923265
You say so with an accentstay you shall be convinced take my clerk to the bank and you will see him leave it with an order on the Treasury for the same sum	62.442363553071836
No said Monte Cristo folding the five notes most decidedly not the thing is so curious I will make the experiment myself	200.92486843275444
I am credited on you for six millions	24.493712978104966
I have drawn nine hundred thousand francs you therefore still owe me five millions and a hundred thousand francs	17.992398894613896
I will take the five scraps of paper that I now hold as bonds with your signature alone and here is a receipt in full for the six millions between us	115.98681716088016
I had prepared it beforehand for I am much in want of money today	46.51925719216066
And Monte Cristo placed the bonds in his pocket with one hand while with the other he held out the receipt to Danglars	26.045837308648604
If a thunderbolt had fallen at the bankers feet he could not have experienced greater terror	72.02072304641814
What he stammered do you mean to keep that money Excuse me excuse me but I owe this money to the charity funda deposit which I promised to pay this morning	94.58909162036453
Oh well then said Monte Cristo I am not particular about these five notes pay me in a different form I wished from curiosity to take these that I might be able to say that without any advice or preparation the house of Danglars had paid me five millions without a minutes delay it would have been remarkable	67.31207208022586
But here are your bonds pay me differently and he held the bonds towards Danglars who seized them like a vulture extending its claws to withhold the food that is being wrested from its grasp	143.7591818792122
Suddenly he rallied made a violent effort to restrain himself and then a smile gradually widened the features of his disturbed countenance	85.6682097200235
Certainly he said your receipt is money	94.01414310634021
Oh dear yes and if you were at Rome the house of Thomson   French would make no more difficulty about paying the money on my receipt than you have just done	33.333589156233685
Then I may keep this money	62.84792901409447
Yes said Danglars while the perspiration started from the roots of his hair	89.6422599448353
Monte Cristo replaced the notes in his pocket with that indescribable expression which seemed to say Come reflect if you repent there is still time	57.18336245692163
No said Danglars no decidedly no keep my signatures	458.51335155738
But you know none are so formal as bankers in transacting business I intended this money for the charity fund and I seemed to be robbing them if I did not pay them with these precise bonds	126.52423907313914
How absurdas if one crown were not as good as another	49.38832855202265
Excuse me and he began to laugh loudly but nervously	349.91419317013384
Certainly I excuse you said Monte Cristo graciously and pocket them	124.83013644792824
And he placed the bonds in his pocketbook	34.11121075221129
But said Danglars there is still a sum of one hundred thousand francs	12.324901443389065
Oh a mere nothing said Monte Cristo	1.954923717502734
The balance would come to about that sum but keep it and we shall be quits	132.0482943561991
Count said Danglars are you speaking seriously	1138.0944037541879
I never joke with bankers said Monte Cristo in a freezing manner which repelled impertinence and he turned to the door just as the valet de chambre announced	41.84703820096791
de Boville ReceiverGeneral of the charities	20094.783294333592
Ma foi said Monte Cristo I think I arrived just in time to obtain your signatures or they would have been disputed with me	50.248364623043855
Danglars again became pale and hastened to conduct the count out	55.35747873005318
Monte Cristo exchanged a ceremonious bow with M	26.018410946694274
de Boville who was standing in the waitingroom and who was introduced into Danglars room as soon as the count had left	32.886019329782144
The counts serious face was illumined by a faint smile as he noticed the portfolio which the receivergeneral held in his hand	53.004162061022924
At the door he found his carriage and was immediately driven to the bank	49.56896783744558
Meanwhile Danglars repressing all emotion advanced to meet the receivergeneral	309.1672828140851
We need not say that a smile of condescension was stamped upon his lips	104.57661910982829
Goodmorning creditor said he for I wager anything it is the creditor who visits me	208.77384689478876
You are right baron answered M	67.18605080336857
de Boville the charities present themselves to you through me the widows and orphans depute me to receive alms to the amount of five millions from you	88.78004071512468
And yet they say orphans are to be pitied said Danglars wishing to prolong the jest	110.87705896403165
Here I am in their name said M	35.11958019076653
de Boville but did you receive my letter yesterday	163.98234084297755
de Boville your widows and orphans must oblige me by waiting twentyfour hours since M	236.389873786393
de Monte Cristo whom you just saw leaving hereyou did see him I think	271.17931719293586
de Monte Cristo has just carried off their five millions	64.35897338170129
The count has an unlimited credit upon me a credit opened by Thomson   French of Rome he came to demand five millions at once which I paid him with checks on the bank	62.73082915763671
My funds are deposited there and you can understand that if I draw out ten millions on the same day it will appear rather strange to the governor	33.3657030480503
Two days will be a different thing said Danglars smiling	59.304358371510595
Come said Boville with a tone of entire incredulity five millions to that gentleman who just left and who bowed to me as though he knew me	68.21851048076508
Perhaps he knows you though you do not know him M	17.570029627325695
de Boville took the paper Danglars presented him and read	51.454464950095236
Received of Baron Danglars the sum of five million one hundred thousand francs to be repaid on demand by the house of Thomson   French of Rome	25.404228453233806
It is really true said M	153.13262246694936
Do you know the house of Thomson   French	4.8136769010431655
Yes I once had business to transact with it to the amount of 200000 francs but since then I have not heard it mentioned	37.17991692514131
It is one of the best houses in Europe said Danglars carelessly throwing down the receipt on his desk	48.88815289344393
And he had five millions in your hands alone Why this Count of Monte Cristo must be a nabob	44.31585606151769
Indeed I do not know what he is he has three unlimited creditsone on me one on Rothschild one on Lafitte and you see he added carelessly he has given me the preference by leaving a balance of 100000 francs	179.030041925472
de Boville manifested signs of extraordinary admiration	737.0392193653663
I must visit him he said and obtain some pious grant from him	245.23657151054616
Oh you may make sure of him his charities alone amount to 20000 francs a month	115.97095669295909
It is magnificent I will set before him the example of Madame de Morcerf and her son	32.11570243112308
They gave all their fortune to the hospitals	154.27816583859945
Because they would not spend money so guiltily acquired	1312.5441956045422
And what are they to live upon	51.05060823863251
The mother retires into the country and the son enters the army	112.535971775913
Well I must confess these are scruples	832.9342640206786
I registered their deed of gift yesterday	4743.887591692598
And how much did they possess	230.3010397252122
Oh not muchfrom twelve to thirteen hundred thousand francs	35.110276443566526
But to return to our millions	215.97055900101955
Certainly said Danglars in the most natural tone in the world	11.09321990312536
Are you then pressed for this money	65.00767585327483
Yes for the examination of our cash takes place tomorrow	294.22940177050697
Tomorrow Why did you not tell me so before Why it is as good as a century At what hour does the examination take place	60.788393994864265
Send at twelve said Danglars smiling	16.505391673858345
de Boville said nothing but nodded his head and took up the portfolio	50.23120000947295
Now I think of it you can do better said Danglars	27.03461569057819
de Monte Cristo is as good as money take it to Rothschilds or Lafittes and they will take it off your hands at once	107.18847736121313
Certainly it will only cost you a discount of 5000 or 6000 francs	106.3093779758035
Ma foi he said I prefer waiting till tomorrow	111.68311370676078
I thought perhaps said Danglars with supreme impertinence that you had a deficiency to make up	131.63760055372578
And if that were the case it would be worth while to make some sacrifice	58.022499362591255
Ah you are laughing at me send tomorrow at twelve and the bank shall be notified	103.87248024469983
Better still since it will afford me the pleasure of seeing you	15.547655325501074
de Boville are you not going to the funeral of poor Mademoiselle de Villefort which I met on my road here	48.7080618997556
No said the banker I have appeared rather ridiculous since that affair of Benedetto so I remain in the background	203.52423852548176
How were you to blame in that affair	74.95295097377527
Listenwhen one bears an irreproachable name as I do one is rather sensitive	111.93756431442937
Everybody pities you sir and above all Mademoiselle Danglars	197.25878839764493
Poor Eugnie said Danglars do you know she is going to embrace a religious life	63.97186170096069
Alas it is unhappily but too true	107.7978075782579
The day after the event she decided on leaving Paris with a nun of her acquaintance they are gone to seek a very strict convent in Italy or Spain	86.15864237043876
Oh it is terrible and M	126.09206200060575
de Boville retired with this exclamation after expressing acute sympathy with the father	748.7202657532491
But he had scarcely left before Danglars with an energy of action those can alone understand who have seen Robert Macaire represented by Frdrick24 exclaimed	226.4048532260157
Then enclosing Monte Cristos receipt in a little pocketbook he addedYes come at twelve oclock I shall then be far away	89.54997170467708
Then he doublelocked his door emptied all his drawers collected about fifty thousand francs in banknotes burned several papers left others exposed to view and then commenced writing a letter which he addressed	163.88671799262426
I will place it on her table myself tonight he murmured	275.5335734129612
Then taking a passport from his drawer he saidGood it is available for two months longer	105.46253454793033
de Boville had indeed met the funeral procession which was taking Valentine to her last home on earth	103.90523322093783
The weather was dull and stormy a cold wind shook the few remaining yellow leaves from the boughs of the trees and scattered them among the crowd which filled the boulevards	88.04684196396371
de Villefort a true Parisian considered the cemetery of PreLachaise alone worthy of receiving the mortal remains of a Parisian family there alone the corpses belonging to him would be surrounded by worthy associates	201.1163531872504
He had therefore purchased a vault which was quickly occupied by members of his family	75.36764257667534
On the front of the monument was inscribed The families of SaintMran and Villefort for such had been the last wish expressed by poor Rene Valentines mother	263.1448754765016
The pompous procession therefore wended its way towards PreLachaise from the Faubourg SaintHonor	75.92673191951495
Having crossed Paris it passed through the Faubourg du Temple then leaving the exterior boulevards it reached the cemetery	78.49438851668813
More than fifty private carriages followed the twenty mourningcoaches and behind them more than five hundred persons joined in the procession on foot	105.60061905577702
These last consisted of all the young people whom Valentines death had struck like a thunderbolt and who notwithstanding the raw chilliness of the season could not refrain from paying a last tribute to the memory of the beautiful chaste and adorable girl thus cut off in the flower of her youth	92.72436679175692
As they left Paris an equipage with four horses at full speed was seen to draw up suddenly it contained Monte Cristo	39.41187585798934
The count left the carriage and mingled in the crowd who followed on foot	34.67583792753464
ChteauRenaud perceived him and immediately alighting from his coup joined him Beauchamp did the same	114.64148507479948
The count looked attentively through every opening in the crowd he was evidently watching for someone but his search ended in disappointment	107.69282026088928
Where is Morrel he asked do either of these gentlemen know where he is	58.94000090218828
We have already asked that question said ChteauRenaud for none of us has seen him	77.90209883249217
The count was silent but continued to gaze around him	107.30122673815397
At length they arrived at the cemetery	20.644949697620294
The piercing eye of Monte Cristo glanced through clusters of bushes and trees and was soon relieved from all anxiety for seeing a shadow glide between the yewtrees Monte Cristo recognized him whom he sought	115.201860868247
One funeral is generally very much like another in this magnificent metropolis	249.20117775185903
Black figures are seen scattered over the long white avenues the silence of earth and heaven is alone broken by the noise made by the crackling branches of hedges planted around the monuments then follows the melancholy chant of the priests mingled now and then with a sob of anguish escaping from some woman concealed behind a mass of flowers	104.1325622433557
The shadow Monte Cristo had noticed passed rapidly behind the tomb of Ablard and Hlose placed itself close to the heads of the horses belonging to the hearse and following the undertakers men arrived with them at the spot appointed for the burial	105.89616375924558
Monte Cristo saw nothing but the shadow which no one else observed	47.47856685134474
Twice the count left the ranks to see whether the object of his interest had any concealed weapon beneath his clothes	146.63866882393668
When the procession stopped this shadow was recognized as Morrel who with his coat buttoned up to his throat his face livid and convulsively crushing his hat between his fingers leaned against a tree situated on an elevation commanding the mausoleum so that none of the funeral details could escape his observation	102.52004397375089
Everything was conducted in the usual manner	51.551419489175956
A few men the least impressed of all by the scene pronounced a discourse some deploring this premature death others expatiating on the grief of the father and one very ingenious person quoting the fact that Valentine had solicited pardon of her father for criminals on whom the arm of justice was ready to falluntil at length they exhausted their stores of metaphor and mournful speeches elaborate variations on the stanzas of Malherbe to Du Prier	305.25391923889947
Monte Cristo heard and saw nothing or rather he only saw Morrel whose calmness had a frightful effect on those who knew what was passing in his heart	29.734589189715155
See said Beauchamp pointing out Morrel to Debray	64.13598891626302
What is he doing up there And they called ChteauRenauds attention to him	319.282839628247
How pale he is said ChteauRenaud shuddering	205.0893132290506
Not at all said ChteauRenaud slowly I think he is violently agitated	115.43422939288669
Bah said Debray he scarcely knew Mademoiselle de Villefort you said so yourself	50.86391272169931
Still I remember he danced three times with her at Madame de Morcerfs	36.27060991466588
Do you recollect that ball count where you produced such an effect	141.11169679667333
No I do not replied Monte Cristo without even knowing of what or to whom he was speaking so much was he occupied in watching Morrel who was holding his breath with emotion	36.28551349377764
The discourse is over farewell gentlemen said the count unceremoniously	258.7400460515367
And he disappeared without anyone seeing whither he went	204.13360382025846
The funeral being over the guests returned to Paris	60.33371577877623
ChteauRenaud looked for a moment for Morrel but while they were watching the departure of the count Morrel had quitted his post and ChteauRenaud failing in his search joined Debray and Beauchamp	60.577363602618746
Monte Cristo concealed himself behind a large tomb and awaited the arrival of Morrel who by degrees approached the tomb now abandoned by spectators and workmen	88.41917720557507
Morrel threw a glance around but before it reached the spot occupied by Monte Cristo the latter had advanced yet nearer still unperceived	151.48649842798116
The count with outstretched neck and glaring eyes stood in an attitude ready to pounce upon Morrel upon the first occasion	73.88748541629927
Morrel bent his head till it touched the stone then clutching the grating with both hands he murmured	104.45491865500527
The counts heart was pierced by the utterance of these two words he stepped forward and touching the young mans shoulder said	39.23586849081945
I was looking for you my friend	57.17578209466248
Monte Cristo expected a burst of passion but he was deceived for Morrel turning round said calmly	90.32043162943009
The scrutinizing glance of the count searched the young man from head to foot	47.001582979915504
Shall I drive you back to Paris he asked	10.223919040585423
The count withdrew without opposition but it was only to place himself in a situation where he could watch every movement of Morrel who at length arose brushed the dust from his knees and turned towards Paris without once looking back	64.58672250256413
He walked slowly down the Rue de la Roquette	21.215533361130696
The count dismissing his carriage followed him about a hundred paces behind	28.037675011673276
Maximilian crossed the canal and entered the Rue Meslay by the boulevards	25.322504714466984
Five minutes after the door had been closed on Morrels entrance it was again opened for the count	28.793938087053515
Julie was at the entrance of the garden where she was attentively watching Penelon who entering with zeal into his profession of gardener was very busy grafting some Bengal roses	217.6536540429719
Ah count she exclaimed with the delight manifested by every member of the family whenever he visited the Rue Meslay	51.071706062281294
Maximilian has just returned has he not madame asked the count	33.52618705471219
Yes I think I saw him pass but pray call Emmanuel	302.7095906594893
Excuse me madame but I must go up to Maximilians room this instant replied Monte Cristo I have something of the greatest importance to tell him	37.15318186106368
Go then she said with a charming smile which accompanied him until he had disappeared	26.55831965694998
Monte Cristo soon ran up the staircase conducting from the ground floor to Maximilians room when he reached the landing he listened attentively but all was still	46.885300523237554
Like many old houses occupied by a single family the room door was panelled with glass but it was locked Maximilian was shut in and it was impossible to see what was passing in the room because a red curtain was drawn before the glass	41.30557395623108
The counts anxiety was manifested by a bright color which seldom appeared on the face of that imperturbable man	54.60871208253836
What shall I do he uttered and reflected for a moment shall I ring No the sound of a bell announcing a visitor will but accelerate the resolution of one in Maximilians situation and then the bell would be followed by a louder noise	153.89764255237802
Monte Cristo trembled from head to foot and as if his determination had been taken with the rapidity of lightning he struck one of the panes of glass with his elbow the glass was shivered to atoms then withdrawing the curtain he saw Morrel who had been writing at his desk bound from his seat at the noise of the broken window	34.652828809381774
I beg a thousand pardons said the count there is nothing the matter but I slipped down and broke one of your panes of glass with my elbow	32.05316598863288
Since it is opened I will take advantage of it to enter your room do not disturb yourselfdo not disturb yourself	71.72537153291009
And passing his hand through the broken glass the count opened the door	21.718557046321838
Morrel evidently discomposed came to meet Monte Cristo less with the intention of receiving him than to exclude his entry	90.48963877656873
Ma foi said Monte Cristo rubbing his elbow its all your servants fault your stairs are so polished it is like walking on glass	233.6479725848197
Are you hurt sir coldly asked Morrel	3.7048679597698144
But what are you about there You were writing	155.50479639655939
Your fingers are stained with ink	309.6082205358488
I do sometimes soldier though I am	6.772887084985354
Monte Cristo advanced into the room Maximilian was obliged to let him pass but he followed him	33.25340839585967
You were writing said Monte Cristo with a searching look	18.079233806948547
I have already had the honor of telling you I was said Morrel	16.32429965602231
Your pistols are beside your desk said Monte Cristo pointing with his finger to the pistols on the table	17.448630786947135
I am on the point of starting on a journey replied Morrel disdainfully	109.5034815052122
My friend exclaimed Monte Cristo in a tone of exquisite sweetness	39.20586475081872
My friend my dear Maximilian do not make a hasty resolution I entreat you	34.258489903555606
I make a hasty resolution said Morrel shrugging his shoulders is there anything extraordinary in a journey	43.837858652152576
Maximilian said the count let us both lay aside the mask we have assumed	58.850011017815646
You no more deceive me with that false calmness than I impose upon you with my frivolous solicitude	160.71852267462828
You can understand can you not that to have acted as I have done to have broken that glass to have intruded on the solitude of a friendyou can understand that to have done all this I must have been actuated by real uneasiness or rather by a terrible conviction	70.3442555064111
Morrel you are going to destroy yourself	123.08207742722028
Indeed count said Morrel shuddering what has put this into your head	84.77879842710132
I tell you that you are about to destroy yourself continued the count and here is proof of what I say and approaching the desk he removed the sheet of paper which Morrel had placed over the letter he had begun and took the latter in his hands	43.66713006091714
Morrel rushed forward to tear it from him but Monte Cristo perceiving his intention seized his wrist with his iron grasp	53.30387360520558
You wish to destroy yourself said the count you have written it	19.530095694321272
Well said Morrel changing his expression of calmness for one of violencewell and if I do intend to turn this pistol against myself who shall prevent mewho will dare prevent me All my hopes are blighted my heart is broken my life a burden everything around me is sad and mournful earth has become distasteful to me and human voices distract me	136.9959327025101
It is a mercy to let me die for if I live I shall lose my reason and become mad	30.26201182734121
When sir I tell you all this with tears of heartfelt anguish can you reply that I am wrong can you prevent my putting an end to my miserable existence Tell me sir could you have the courage to do so	75.35425738748557
Yes Morrel said Monte Cristo with a calmness which contrasted strangely with the young mans excitement yes I would do so	61.84097020349922
You exclaimed Morrel with increasing anger and reproachyou who have deceived me with false hopes who have cheered and soothed me with vain promises when I might if not have saved her at least have seen her die in my arms You who pretend to understand everything even the hidden sources of knowledgeand who enact the part of a guardian angel upon earth and could not even find an antidote to a poison administered to a young girl Ah sir indeed you would inspire me with pity were you not hateful in my eyes	122.53689315219391
Yes you tell me to lay aside the mask and I will do so be satisfied When you spoke to me at the cemetery I answered youmy heart was softened when you arrived here I allowed you to enter	85.20273905214319
But since you abuse my confidence since you have devised a new torture after I thought I had exhausted them all then Count of Monte Cristo my pretended benefactorthen Count of Monte Cristo the universal guardian be satisfied you shall witness the death of your friend and Morrel with a maniacal laugh again rushed towards the pistols	101.08152635347673
And I again repeat you shall not commit suicide	224.9289283234226
Prevent me then replied Morrel with another struggle which like the first failed in releasing him from the counts iron grasp	151.18060847686246
And who are you then that arrogate to yourself this tyrannical right over free and rational beings	833.770022718967
Who am I repeated Monte Cristo	1.0133458380344496
Listen I am the only man in the world having the right to say to you Morrel your fathers son shall not die today and Monte Cristo with an expression of majesty and sublimity advanced with arms folded toward the young man who involuntarily overcome by the commanding manner of this man recoiled a step	54.808826306976016
Why do you mention my father stammered he why do you mingle a recollection of him with the affairs of today	71.33963177274278
Because I am he who saved your fathers life when he wished to destroy himself as you do todaybecause I am the man who sent the purse to your young sister and the Pharaon to old Morrelbecause I am the Edmond Dants who nursed you a child on my knees	71.68487743360974
Morrel made another step back staggering breathless crushed then all his strength give way and he fell prostrate at the feet of Monte Cristo	102.20583536815259
Then his admirable nature underwent a complete and sudden revulsion he arose rushed out of the room and to the stairs exclaiming energetically Julie JulieEmmanuel Emmanuel	213.8830417755985
Monte Cristo endeavored also to leave but Maximilian would have died rather than relax his hold of the handle of the door which he closed upon the count	70.90879746105317
Julie Emmanuel and some of the servants ran up in alarm on hearing the cries of Maximilian	48.07272822044903
Morrel seized their hands and opening the door exclaimed in a voice choked with sobs	71.4061476997561
On your kneeson your kneeshe is our benefactorthe saviour of our father He is	214.85028141163627
He would have added Edmond Dants but the count seized his arm and prevented him	27.060002032282306
Julie threw herself into the arms of the count Emmanuel embraced him as a guardian angel Morrel again fell on his knees and struck the ground with his forehead	28.323331498077003
Then the ironhearted man felt his heart swell in his breast a flame seemed to rush from his throat to his eyes he bent his head and wept	35.77801414450097
For a while nothing was heard in the room but a succession of sobs while the incense from their grateful hearts mounted to heaven	80.0395536329517
Julie had scarcely recovered from her deep emotion when she rushed out of the room descended to the next floor ran into the drawingroom with childlike joy and raised the crystal globe which covered the purse given by the unknown of the Alles de Meilhan	43.23225809654941
Meanwhile Emmanuel in a broken voice said to the count	15.655204583216989
Oh count how could you hearing us so often speak of our unknown benefactor seeing us pay such homage of gratitude and adoration to his memoryhow could you continue so long without discovering yourself to us Oh it was cruel to us anddare I say itto you also	214.92490441217285
Listen my friends said the countI may call you so since we have really been friends for the last eleven yearsthe discovery of this secret has been occasioned by a great event which you must never know	92.26283961762289
I wished to bury it during my whole life in my own bosom but your brother Maximilian wrested it from me by a violence he repents of now I am sure	108.8126895134161
Then turning around and seeing that Morrel still on his knees had thrown himself into an armchair he added in a low voice pressing Emmanuels hand significantly Watch over him	63.41245119562767
Why so asked the young man surprised	41.68427717891295
I can not explain myself but watch over him	106.03713170898277
Emmanuel looked around the room and caught sight of the pistols his eyes rested on the weapons and he pointed to them	43.71370578419593
Then walking towards Morrel he took his hand the tumultuous agitation of the young man was succeeded by a profound stupor	43.408226385612735
Julie returned holding the silken purse in her hands while tears of joy rolled down her cheeks like dewdrops on the rose	62.88390845414062
Here is the relic she said do not think it will be less dear to us now we are acquainted with our benefactor	23.332179265472025
My child said Monte Cristo coloring allow me to take back that purse Since you now know my face I wish to be remembered alone through the affection I hope you will grant me	102.34396879471825
Oh said Julie pressing the purse to her heart no no I beseech you do not take it for some unhappy day you will leave us will you not	30.86607311216987
You have guessed rightly madame replied Monte Cristo smiling in a week I shall have left this country where so many persons who merit the vengeance of Heaven lived happily while my father perished of hunger and grief	63.28656944529489
While announcing his departure the count fixed his eyes on Morrel and remarked that the words I shall have left this country had failed to rouse him from his lethargy	52.75955387620418
He then saw that he must make another struggle against the grief of his friend and taking the hands of Emmanuel and Julie which he pressed within his own he said with the mild authority of a father	56.235087005401006
My kind friends leave me alone with Maximilian	72.59063901829245
Julie saw the means offered of carrying off her precious relic which Monte Cristo had forgotten	137.95198953083758
She drew her husband to the door	10.154493065288307
Let us leave them she said	2.309655455767067
The count was alone with Morrel who remained motionless as a statue	22.24443028500402
Come said MonteCristo touching his shoulder with his finger are you a man again Maximilian	72.34976642540063
Yes for I begin to suffer again	117.3474115480859
The count frowned apparently in gloomy hesitation	1389.466008287288
Maximilian Maximilian he said the ideas you yield to are unworthy of a Christian	185.6119020632317
Oh do not fear my friend said Morrel raising his head and smiling with a sweet expression on the count I shall no longer attempt my life	21.70881951858043
Then we are to have no more pistolsno more despair	466.73937884629424
No I have found a better remedy for my grief than either a bullet or a knife	107.24878711283444
My grief will kill me of itself	219.57106729183886
My friend said Monte Cristo with an expression of melancholy equal to his own listen to me	25.816039278553642
One day in a moment of despair like yours since it led to a similar resolution I also wished to kill myself one day your father equally desperate wished to kill himself too	120.18036200489699
If anyone had said to your father at the moment he raised the pistol to his headif anyone had told me when in my prison I pushed back the food I had not tasted for three daysif anyone had said to either of us then Livethe day will come when you will be happy and will bless lifeno matter whose voice had spoken we should have heard him with the smile of doubt or the anguish of incredulityand yet how many times has your father blessed life while embracing youhow often have I myself	165.80109432241628
Ah exclaimed Morrel interrupting the count you had only lost your liberty my father had only lost his fortune but I have lost Valentine	52.73639100997621
Look at me said Monte Cristo with that expression which sometimes made him so eloquent and persuasivelook at me	77.13834045340603
There are no tears in my eyes nor is there fever in my veins yet I see you sufferyou Maximilian whom I love as my own son	69.0811618202564
Well does not this tell you that in grief as in life there is always something to look forward to beyond Now if I entreat if I order you to live Morrel it is in the conviction that one day you will thank me for having preserved your life	93.96784086429392
Oh heavens said the young man oh heavenswhat are you saying count Take care	239.16399540216645
But perhaps you have never loved	106.58740360150668
You see I have been a soldier ever since I attained manhood	741.8644065151536
I reached the age of twentynine without loving for none of the feelings I before then experienced merit the appellation of love	415.87016012790525
Well at twentynine I saw Valentine for two years I have loved her for two years I have seen written in her heart as in a book all the virtues of a daughter and wife	40.37507870474911
Count to possess Valentine would have been a happiness too infinite too ecstatic too complete too divine for this world since it has been denied me but without Valentine the earth is desolate	232.14862816772174
I have told you to hope said the count	36.49569302819102
Then have a care I repeat for you seek to persuade me and if you succeed I should lose my reason for I should hope that I could again behold Valentine	63.51950768433806
My friend my father said Morrel with excitement have a care I again repeat for the power you wield over me alarms me	239.2606586357421
Weigh your words before you speak for my eyes have already become brighter and my heart beats strongly be cautious or you will make me believe in supernatural agencies	297.3890445133352
I must obey you though you bade me call forth the dead or walk upon the water	97.02731557980609
Hope my friend repeated the count	27.678879544084484
Ah said Morrel falling from the height of excitement to the abyss of despairah you are playing with me like those good or rather selfish mothers who soothe their children with honeyed words because their screams annoy them	255.90185541490726
No my friend I was wrong to caution you do not fear I will bury my grief so deep in my heart I will disguise it so that you shall not even care to sympathize with me	61.824598542792614
On the contrary said the count after this time you must live with meyou must not leave me and in a week we shall have left France behind us	27.328418573342827
