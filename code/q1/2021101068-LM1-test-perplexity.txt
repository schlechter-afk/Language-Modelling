Athos and DArtagnan with the activity of two soldiers and the knowledge of two connoisseurs hardly required three hours to purchase the entire equipment of the Musketeer	340.4839250562366
Besides Athos was very easy and a noble to his fingers ends	310.5833695873995
When a thing suited him he paid the price demanded without thinking to ask for any abatement	689.7137924436292
DArtagnan would have remonstrated at this but Athos put his hand upon his shoulder with a smile and DArtagnan understood that it was all very well for such a little Gascon gentleman as himself to drive a bargain but not for a man who had the bearing of a prince	101.05453715142718
The Musketeer met with a superb Andalusian horse black as jet nostrils of fire legs clean and elegant rising six years	3917.835386566603
He examined him and found him sound and without blemish	1407.408136457732
They asked a thousand livres for him	76.54317658497534
He might perhaps have been bought for less but while DArtagnan was discussing the price with the dealer Athos was counting out the money on the table	472.2408657945756
Grimaud had a stout short Picard cob which cost three hundred livres	5541.526937693419
But when the saddle and arms for Grimaud were purchased Athos had not a sou left of his hundred and fifty pistoles	1038.918831620633
DArtagnan offered his friend a part of his share which he should return when convenient	278.5477431230538
But Athos only replied to this proposal by shrugging his shoulders	564.032064294693
How much did the Jew say he would give for the sapphire if he purchased it said Athos	206.77659130931693
That is to say two hundred morea hundred pistoles for you and a hundred pistoles for me	234.59062004022542
Well now that would be a real fortune to us my friend let us go back to the Jews again	88.86201012812911
This ring would certainly only recall very bitter remembrances then we shall never be masters of three hundred pistoles to redeem it so that we really should lose two hundred pistoles by the bargain	339.1106155780607
Go and tell him the ring is his DArtagnan and bring back the two hundred pistoles with you	225.05999639543091
Ready money is needful for the present time and we must learn how to make sacrifices	189.84098453967252
Go DArtagnan go Grimaud will accompany you with his musketoon	426.980371091572
A half hour afterward DArtagnan returned with the two thousand livres and without having met with any accident	85.00371700030382
It was thus Athos found at home resources which he did not expect	175.95825214069885
At four oclock the four friends were all assembled with Athos	323.1400009800996
Their anxiety about their outfits had all disappeared and each countenance only preserved the expression of its own secret disquietfor behind all present happiness is concealed a fear for the future	452.7569036550524
Suddenly Planchet entered bringing two letters for DArtagnan	771.139973315626
The one was a little billet genteelly folded with a pretty seal in green wax on which was impressed a dove bearing a green branch	1673.742069278541
The other was a large square epistle resplendent with the terrible arms of his Eminence the cardinal duke	1290.26891183518
At the sight of the little letter the heart of DArtagnan bounded for he believed he recognized the handwriting and although he had seen that writing but once the memory of it remained at the bottom of his heart	116.62320111348627
He therefore seized the little epistle and opened it eagerly	746.2388256090682
Be said the letter on Thursday next at from six to seven oclock in the evening on the road to Chaillot and look carefully into the carriages that pass but if you have any consideration for your own life or that of those who love you do not speak a single word do not make a movement which may lead anyone to believe you have recognized her who exposes herself to everything for the sake of seeing you but for an instant	152.69579468762626
That s a snare said Athos do nt go DArtagnan	1063.8901923029462
And yet replied DArtagnan I think I recognize the writing	140.93868905716698
It may be counterfeit said Athos	2019.2458010466692
Between six and seven oclock the road of Chaillot is quite deserted you might as well go and ride in the forest of Bondy	370.52729023597567
But suppose we all go said DArtagnan what the devil They wo nt devour us all four four lackeys horses arms and all	1189.1928957605571
And besides it will be a chance for displaying our new equipments said Porthos	888.0865009513348
But if it is a woman who writes said Aramis and that woman desires not to be seen remember you compromise her DArtagnan which is not the part of a gentleman	215.37904138684385
We will remain in the background said Porthos and he will advance alone	626.4250002503823
Yes but a pistol shot is easily fired from a carriage which goes at a gallop	286.1541281623532
Bah said DArtagnan they will miss me if they fire we will ride after the carriage and exterminate those who may be in it	275.6396483191878
He is right said Porthos battle	35180325.27793941
Besides we must try our own arms	116.20212813187351
Bah let us enjoy that pleasure said Aramis with his mild and careless manner	391.1188400151096
Gentlemen said DArtagnan it is half past four and we have scarcely time to be on the road of Chaillot by six	165.35636713807577
Besides if we go out too late nobody will see us said Porthos and that will be a pity	115.94971757234487
But this second letter said Athos you forget that it appears to me however that the seal denotes that it deserves to be opened	241.95586634993776
For my part I declare DArtagnan I think it of much more consequence than the little piece of waste paper you have so cunningly slipped into your bosom	377.60187231648797
Well said he let us see gentlemen what are his Eminences commands and DArtagnan unsealed the letter and read	464.2922106458252
dArtagnan of the kings Guards company Dessessart is expected at the PalaisCardinal this evening at eight oclock	464.1139309367476
LA HOUDINIERE Captain of the Guards	18099.30686028542
The devil said Athos heres a rendezvous much more serious than the other	166.8541528480635
I will go to the second after attending the first said DArtagnan	1270.4346246047824
One is for seven oclock and the other for eight there will be time for both	164.96325505842617
Hum I would not go at all said Aramis	135.55823914601433
A gallant knight can not decline a rendezvous with a lady but a prudent gentleman may excuse himself from not waiting on his Eminence particularly when he has reason to believe he is not invited to make his compliments	353.99683456536263
I am of Aramiss opinion said Porthos	468.47544142703936
Gentlemen replied DArtagnan I have already received by Monsieur de Cavois a similar invitation from his Eminence	496.2088382430277
I neglected it and on the morrow a serious misfortune happened to meConstance disappeared	808.9092948436886
Whatever may ensue I will go	24.58365227332554
If you are determined said Athos do so	432.6058000404395
Bah you will get me out if they put me there said DArtagnan	297.8056120007564
To be sure we will replied Aramis and Porthos with admirable promptness and decision as if that were the simplest thing in the world to be sure we will get you out but meantime as we are to set off the day after tomorrow you would do much better not to risk this Bastille	235.8713579183446
Let us do better than that said Athos do not let us leave him during the whole evening	75.29372861692578
Let each of us wait at a gate of the palace with three Musketeers behind him if we see a close carriage at all suspicious in appearance come out let us fall upon it	347.06910149772307
It is a long time since we have had a skirmish with the Guards of Monsieur the Cardinal Monsieur de Trville must think us dead	251.38138118465653
To a certainty Athos said Aramis you were meant to be a general of the army What do you think of the plan gentlemen	123.82289114223465
Admirable replied the young men in chorus	2232.724865169239
Well said Porthos I will run to the htel and engage our comrades to hold themselves in readiness by eight oclock the rendezvous the Place du PalaisCardinal	378.64374281724855
Meantime you see that the lackeys saddle the horses	3980.369656399523
I have no horse said DArtagnan but that is of no consequence I can take one of Monsieur de Trvilles	88.19947702105293
That is not worth while said Aramis you can have one of mine	91.44322166902167
One of yours how many have you then asked DArtagnan	378.62558101239057
Certes cried Athos you are the bestmounted poet of France or Navarre	710.6238336612089
Well my dear Aramis you do nt want three horses I can not comprehend what induced you to buy three	202.73208098127012
Therefore I only purchased two said Aramis	4117.982700681918
The third then fell from the clouds I suppose	186.20400343704938
No the third was brought to me this very morning by a groom out of livery who would not tell me in whose service he was and who said he had received orders from his master	122.28162068093347
That makes no difference said Aramis coloring and who affirmed as I said that he had received orders from his master or mistress to place the horse in my stable without informing me whence it came	411.55869211759676
It is only to poets that such things happen said Athos gravely	516.4971659946663
Well in that case we can manage famously said DArtagnan which of the two horses will you ridethat which you bought or the one that was given to you	340.73441759119464
That which was given to me assuredly	1625.8138181904226
You can not for a moment imagine DArtagnan that I would commit such an offense toward	852.9307491287924
Or the mysterious benefactress said Athos	2091.047783809102
The one you bought will then become useless to you	172.5107291661666
The safety of the horseman you know depends almost always upon the goodness of his horse	235.85618861006097
Well transfer it to me at the price it cost you	100.88170407392933
I was going to make you the offer my dear DArtagnan giving you all the time necessary for repaying me such a trifle	344.9135065975312
How much did it cost you	5.474128410808515
Here are forty double pistoles my dear friend said DArtagnan taking the sum from his pocket I know that is the coin in which you were paid for your poems	87.75495185589853
You are rich then said Aramis	3354.6478248897947
And DArtagnan chinked the remainder of his pistoles in his pocket	61.28062678172334
Send your saddle then to the htel of the Musketeers and your horse can be brought back with ours	241.09649053962224
Very well but it is already five oclock so make haste	580.0022733559337
A quarter of an hour afterward Porthos appeared at the end of the Rue Frou on a very handsome genet	193.4808179000763
Mousqueton followed him upon an Auvergne horse small but very handsome	11698.48842665551
Porthos was resplendent with joy and pride	69.96763712123352
At the same time Aramis made his appearance at the other end of the street upon a superb English charger	113.964037591347
Bazin followed him upon a roan holding by the halter a vigorous Mecklenburg horse this was DArtagnans mount	3357.1810728044466
The two Musketeers met at the gate	25.091572528445152
Athos and DArtagnan watched their approach from the window	95.9555928499725
The devil cried Aramis you have a magnificent horse there Porthos	632.4369490432006
Yes replied Porthos it is the one that ought to have been sent to me at first	66.05799850905005
A bad joke of the husbands substituted the other but the husband has been punished since and I have obtained full satisfaction	321.4724642348899
Planchet and Grimaud appeared in their turn leading their masters steeds	850.8136533097654
DArtagnan and Athos put themselves into saddle with their companions and all four set forward Athos upon a horse he owed to a woman Aramis on a horse he owed to his mistress Porthos on a horse he owed to his procurators wife and DArtagnan on a horse he owed to his good fortunethe best mistress possible	488.06922376508993
As Porthos had foreseen the cavalcade produced a good effect and if Mme	1270.062447951666
Coquenard had met Porthos and seen what a superb appearance he made upon his handsome Spanish genet she would not have regretted the bleeding she had inflicted upon the strongbox of her husband	565.7453925906361
Near the Louvre the four friends met with M	67.15855883899162
de Trville who was returning from St	970.6217446790943
Germain he stopped them to offer his compliments upon their appointments which in an instant drew round them a hundred gapers	606.0722663637913
DArtagnan profited by the circumstance to speak to M	58.631034053668444
de Trville of the letter with the great red seal and the cardinals arms	322.1680881805111
It is well understood that he did not breathe a word about the other	51.86682904696414
de Trville approved of the resolution he had adopted and assured him that if on the morrow he did not appear he himself would undertake to find him let him be where he might	147.9289240271399
At this moment the clock of La Samaritaine struck six the four friends pleaded an engagement and took leave of M	410.86006647785973
A short gallop brought them to the road of Chaillot the day began to decline carriages were passing and repassing	373.9087140110261
DArtagnan keeping at some distance from his friends darted a scrutinizing glance into every carriage that appeared but saw no face with which he was acquainted	292.75562836520726
At length after waiting a quarter of an hour and just as twilight was beginning to thicken a carriage appeared coming at a quick pace on the road of Svres	166.21114454761977
A presentiment instantly told DArtagnan that this carriage contained the person who had appointed the rendezvous the young man was himself astonished to find his heart beat so violently	108.01268557996026
Almost instantly a female head was put out at the window with two fingers placed upon her mouth either to enjoin silence or to send him a kiss	236.75948854395085
DArtagnan uttered a slight cry of joy this woman or rather this apparitionfor the carriage passed with the rapidity of a visionwas Mme	251.55509359200448
By an involuntary movement and in spite of the injunction given DArtagnan put his horse into a gallop and in a few strides overtook the carriage but the window was hermetically closed the vision had disappeared	206.35505424369848
DArtagnan then remembered the injunction If you value your own life or that of those who love you remain motionless and as if you had seen nothing	93.21478527496905
He stopped therefore trembling not for himself but for the poor woman who had evidently exposed herself to great danger by appointing this rendezvous	267.7692573925895
The carriage pursued its way still going at a great pace till it dashed into Paris and disappeared	400.0795714555323
DArtagnan remained fixed to the spot astounded and not knowing what to think	438.2355360237004
Bonacieux and if she was returning to Paris why this fugitive rendezvous why this simple exchange of a glance why this lost kiss If on the other side it was not shewhich was still quite possiblefor the little light that remained rendered a mistake easymight it not be the commencement of some plot against him through the allurement of this woman for whom his love was known	414.38177327186725
All had plainly seen a womans head appear at the window but none of them except Athos knew Mme	697.5286688207153
The opinion of Athos was that it was indeed she but less preoccupied by that pretty face than DArtagnan he had fancied he saw a second head a mans head inside the carriage	318.68090470692897
If that be the case said DArtagnan they are doubtless transporting her from one prison to another	535.034626202145
But what can they intend to do with the poor creature and how shall I ever meet her again	62.79992327261934
Friend said Athos gravely remember that it is the dead alone with whom we are not likely to meet again on this earth	63.14296438680796
You know something of that as well as I do I think	20.468708026624093
Now if your mistress is not dead if it is she we have just seen you will meet with her again some day or other	77.93026941720157
And perhaps my God added he with that misanthropic tone which was peculiar to him perhaps sooner than you wish	141.01497818897374
The carriage had been twenty minutes behind the time appointed	173.28076721902588
DArtagnans friends reminded him that he had a visit to pay but at the same time bade him observe that there was yet time to retract	99.09436837919483
But DArtagnan was at the same time impetuous and curious	369.3881707566425
He had made up his mind that he would go to the PalaisCardinal and that he would learn what his Eminence had to say to him	90.51870045260443
Nothing could turn him from his purpose	120.84861143961648
Honor and in the Place du PalaisCardinal they found the twelve invited Musketeers walking about in expectation of their comrades	793.5450988898438
There only they explained to them the matter in hand	200.41322786829252
DArtagnan was well known among the honorable corps of the kings Musketeers in which it was known he would one day take his place he was considered beforehand as a comrade	180.57722652555137
It resulted from these antecedents that everyone entered heartily into the purpose for which they met besides it would not be unlikely that they would have an opportunity of playing either the cardinal or his people an ill turn and for such expeditions these worthy gentlemen were always ready	349.6913541259362
Athos divided them into three groups assumed the command of one gave the second to Aramis and the third to Porthos and then each group went and took their watch near an entrance	330.7218112333026
DArtagnan on his part entered boldly at the principal gate	791.4146539947719
Although he felt himself ably supported the young man was not without a little uneasiness as he ascended the great staircase step by step	102.8572649941627
His conduct toward Milady bore a strong resemblance to treachery and he was very suspicious of the political relations which existed between that woman and the cardinal	314.8234323245921
Still further De Wardes whom he had treated so ill was one of the tools of his Eminence and DArtagnan knew that while his Eminence was terrible to his enemies he was strongly attached to his friends	165.2671784514657
If De Wardes has related all our affair to the cardinal which is not to be doubted and if he has recognized me as is probable I may consider myself almost as a condemned man said DArtagnan shaking his head	119.90214994621714
But why has he waited till now That s all plain enough	1264.118418321023
Milady has laid her complaints against me with that hypocritical grief which renders her so interesting and this last offense has made the cup overflow	426.3214142620514
Fortunately added he my good friends are down yonder and they will not allow me to be carried away without a struggle	81.21196504965215
Nevertheless Monsieur de Trvilles company of Musketeers alone can not maintain a war against the cardinal who disposes of the forces of all France and before whom the queen is without power and the king without will	271.10543481908
DArtagnan my friend you are brave you are prudent you have excellent qualities but the women will ruin you	272.55471883838504
He came to this melancholy conclusion as he entered the antechamber	149.4868496558202
He placed his letter in the hands of the usher on duty who led him into the waiting room and passed on into the interior of the palace	117.03977631327635
In this waiting room were five or six of the cardinals Guards who recognized DArtagnan and knowing that it was he who had wounded Jussac they looked upon him with a smile of singular meaning	156.57080648829444
This smile appeared to DArtagnan to be of bad augury	614.1529945306571
Only as our Gascon was not easily intimidatedor rather thanks to a great pride natural to the men of his country he did not allow one easily to see what was passing in his mind when that which was passing at all resembled fearhe placed himself haughtily in front of Messieurs the Guards and waited with his hand on his hip in an attitude by no means deficient in majesty	298.33147992075885
The usher returned and made a sign to DArtagnan to follow him	27.049178124184994
It appeared to the young man that the Guards on seeing him depart chuckled among themselves	1424.4317443837924
He traversed a corridor crossed a grand saloon entered a library and found himself in the presence of a man seated at a desk and writing	99.34871540866824
The usher introduced him and retired without speaking a word	100.20737826199459
DArtagnan remained standing and examined this man	75.79032333190216
DArtagnan at first believed that he had to do with some judge examining his papers but he perceived that the man at the desk wrote or rather corrected lines of unequal length scanning the words on his fingers	271.77084451917807
He saw then that he was with a poet	163.0133121297403
At the end of an instant the poet closed his manuscript upon the cover of which was written Mirame a Tragedy in Five Acts and raised his head	718.4727179500541
The cardinal leaned his elbow on his manuscript his cheek upon his hand and looked intently at the young man for a moment	51.91521448801665
No one had a more searching eye than the Cardinal de Richelieu and DArtagnan felt this glance run through his veins like a fever	357.55010643951795
He however kept a good countenance holding his hat in his hand and awaiting the good pleasure of his Eminence without too much assurance but also without too much humility	241.1276110220849
Monsieur said the cardinal are you a DArtagnan from Barn	1559.3781343096814
Yes monseigneur replied the young man	1.6831277928048523
There are several branches of the DArtagnans at Tarbes and in its environs said the cardinal to which do you belong	274.7539020821201
I am the son of him who served in the Religious Wars under the great King Henry the father of his gracious Majesty	648.733219084784
It is you who set out seven or eight months ago from your country to seek your fortune in the capital	88.83185232254911
You came through Meung where something befell you	1449.735232715217
I do nt very well know what but still something	312.69421474614063
Monseigneur said DArtagnan this was what happened to me	133.3007757212141
Never mind never mind resumed the cardinal with a smile which indicated that he knew the story as well as he who wished to relate it	49.64707305518988
You were recommended to Monsieur de Trville were you not	98.3972481202943
Yes monseigneur but in that unfortunate affair at Meung	4448.433000811917
The letter was lost replied his Eminence yes I know that	263.7939147938317
But Monsieur de Trville is a skilled physiognomist who knows men at first sight and he placed you in the company of his brotherinlaw Monsieur Dessessart leaving you to hope that one day or other you should enter the Musketeers	340.5405905097048
Monseigneur is correctly informed said DArtagnan	2592.4563404367395
Since that time many things have happened to you	19.953708146214268
You were walking one day behind the Chartreux when it would have been better if you had been elsewhere	112.33702165650514
Then you took with your friends a journey to the waters of Forges they stopped on the road but you continued yours	236.01620417395878
That is all very simple you had business in England	331.9868272387752
Monseigneur said DArtagnan quite confused I went	271.0379697027622
Hunting at Windsor or elsewherethat concerns nobody	80249.46040766538
I know because it is my office to know everything	136.56266195685404
On your return you were received by an august personage and I perceive with pleasure that you preserve the souvenir she gave you	359.09896166860676
DArtagnan placed his hand upon the queens diamond which he wore and quickly turned the stone inward but it was too late	132.80077300236354
The day after that you received a visit from Cavois resumed the cardinal	695.1113902619996
He went to desire you to come to the palace	88.73697192694873
You have not returned that visit and you were wrong	263.10098890393704
Monseigneur I feared I had incurred disgrace with your Eminence	6939.272367643729
How could that be monsieur Could you incur my displeasure by having followed the orders of your superiors with more intelligence and courage than another would have done It is the people who do not obey that I punish and not those who like you obeybut too well	277.3152315595851
As a proof remember the date of the day on which I had you bidden to come to me and seek in your memory for what happened to you that very night	90.14665607777172
That was the very evening when the abduction of Mme	562.7276733097352
DArtagnan trembled and he likewise recollected that during the past half hour the poor woman had passed close to him without doubt carried away by the same power that had caused her disappearance	221.49372860407905
In short continued the cardinal as I have heard nothing of you for some time past I wished to know what you were doing	40.75230505236575
Besides you owe me some thanks	17301.52090571056
You must yourself have remarked how much you have been considered in all the circumstances	44.3001067296817
That continued the cardinal arose not only from a feeling of natural equity but likewise from a plan I have marked out with respect to you	277.2410460677762
DArtagnan became more and more astonished	214.60563126824638
I wished to explain this plan to you on the day you received my first invitation but you did not come	93.0438790321185
Fortunately nothing is lost by this delay and you are now about to hear it	71.0629777176476
Sit down there before me DArtagnan you are gentleman enough not to listen standing	1033.0244163534624
And the cardinal pointed with his finger to a chair for the young man who was so astonished at what was passing that he awaited a second sign from his interlocutor before he obeyed	66.46636714730926
You are brave Monsieur dArtagnan continued his Eminence you are prudent which is still better	429.5694056320885
I like men of head and heart	161.93413433490082
Do nt be afraid said he smiling	49.982101071501624
By men of heart I mean men of courage	638.1407417947756
But young as you are and scarcely entering into the world you have powerful enemies if you do not take great heed they will destroy you	264.8073920892507
Alas monseigneur replied the young man very easily no doubt for they are strong and well supported while I am alone	147.9770830337052
Yes that s true but alone as you are you have done much already and will do still more I do nt doubt	206.25141930738906
Yet you have need I believe to be guided in the adventurous career you have undertaken for if I mistake not you came to Paris with the ambitious idea of making your fortune	129.2157146224628
I am at the age of extravagant hopes monseigneur said DArtagnan	1848.6228115235372
There are no extravagant hopes but for fools monsieur and you are a man of understanding	240.42745110219687
Now what would you say to an ensigns commission in my Guards and a company after the campaign	795.4563664625841
You accept it do you not	2.487351585075045
Monseigneur replied DArtagnan with an embarrassed air	1080.8032617392696
How You refuse cried the cardinal with astonishment	406.21994420684007
I am in his Majestys Guards monseigneur and I have no reason to be dissatisfied	361.3360258221386
But it appears to me that my Guardsmineare also his Majestys Guards and whoever serves in a French corps serves the king	2064.6998277175126
Monseigneur your Eminence has ill understood my words	395.5795265187604
You want a pretext do you not I comprehend	59.11237601919371
Well you have this excuse advancement the opening campaign the opportunity which I offer youso much for the world	973.6346809342009
As regards yourself the need of protection for it is fit you should know Monsieur dArtagnan that I have received heavy and serious complaints against you	257.22637959347765
You do not consecrate your days and nights wholly to the kings service	866.893698096538
In fact said the cardinal placing his hand upon a bundle of papers I have here a whole pile which concerns you	114.70972622944144
I know you to be a man of resolution and your services well directed instead of leading you to ill might be very advantageous to you	348.7300832808319
Your goodness confounds me monseigneur replied DArtagnan and I am conscious of a greatness of soul in your Eminence that makes me mean as an earthworm but since Monseigneur permits me to speak freely	365.82182915945776
Then I will presume to say that all my friends are in the kings Musketeers and Guards and that by an inconceivable fatality my enemies are in the service of your Eminence I should therefore be ill received here and ill regarded there if I accepted what Monseigneur offers me	305.61147574138005
Do you happen to entertain the haughty idea that I have not yet made you an offer equal to your value asked the cardinal with a smile of disdain	75.7086505558426
Monseigneur your Eminence is a hundred times too kind to me and on the contrary I think I have not proved myself worthy of your goodness	57.60359335035839
The siege of La Rochelle is about to be resumed monseigneur	411.6359149646996
I shall serve under the eye of your Eminence and if I have the good fortune to conduct myself at the siege in such a manner as merits your attention then I shall at least leave behind me some brilliant action to justify the protection with which you honor me	152.18150137962553
Everything is best in its time monseigneur	32130.13482338588
Hereafter perhaps I shall have the right of giving myself at present I shall appear to sell myself	104.4294497646049
That is to say you refuse to serve me monsieur said the cardinal with a tone of vexation through which however might be seen a sort of esteem remain free then and guard your hatreds and your sympathies	239.67927719616068
Well well said the cardinal I do nt wish you any ill but you must be aware that it is quite trouble enough to defend and recompense our friends	125.76693645886002
We owe nothing to our enemies and let me give you a piece of advice take care of yourself Monsieur dArtagnan for from the moment I withdraw my hand from behind you I would not give an obolus for your life	127.4992251791491
I will try to do so monseigneur replied the Gascon with a noble confidence	133.99657155720186
Remember at a later period and at a certain moment if any mischance should happen to you said Richelieu significantly that it was I who came to seek you and that I did all in my power to prevent this misfortune befalling you	115.05766641241678
I shall entertain whatever may happen said DArtagnan placing his hand upon his breast and bowing an eternal gratitude toward your Eminence for that which you now do for me	195.99285474851678
Well let it be then as you have said Monsieur dArtagnan we shall see each other again after the campaign	81.15159979980375
I will have my eye upon you for I shall be there replied the cardinal pointing with his finger to a magnificent suit of armor he was to wear and on our return wellwe will settle our account	185.83467311818097
Ah monseigneur cried DArtagnan spare me the weight of your displeasure	217.69170542396992
Remain neutral monseigneur if you find that I act as becomes a gallant man	377.16602228795335
Young man said Richelieu if I shall be able to say to you at another time what I have said to you today I promise you to do so	28.62354068185074
This last expression of Richelieus conveyed a terrible doubt it alarmed DArtagnan more than a menace would have done for it was a warning	276.65055865287565
The cardinal then was seeking to preserve him from some misfortune which threatened him	97.86947090308561
He opened his mouth to reply but with a haughty gesture the cardinal dismissed him	305.0437634770724
DArtagnan went out but at the door his heart almost failed him and he felt inclined to return	131.8863826138396
Then the noble and severe countenance of Athos crossed his mind if he made the compact with the cardinal which he required Athos would no more give him his handAthos would renounce him	314.3452580901218
It was this fear that restrained him so powerful is the influence of a truly great character on all that surrounds it	238.18330175988922
DArtagnan descended by the staircase at which he had entered and found Athos and the four Musketeers waiting his appearance and beginning to grow uneasy	285.29530568270394
With a word DArtagnan reassured them and Planchet ran to inform the other sentinels that it was useless to keep guard longer as his master had come out safe from the PalaisCardinal	382.8693208177289
Returned home with Athos Aramis and Porthos inquired eagerly the cause of the strange interview but DArtagnan confined himself to telling them that M	387.1314815445401
de Richelieu had sent for him to propose to him to enter into his guards with the rank of ensign and that he had refused	87.60629505035338
And you were right cried Aramis and Porthos with one voice	637.8447750771834
Athos fell into a profound reverie and answered nothing	367.9900177495446
But when they were alone he said You have done that which you ought to have done DArtagnan but perhaps you have been wrong	69.60887393450997
DArtagnan sighed deeply for this voice responded to a secret voice of his soul which told him that great misfortunes awaited him	281.91687254188065
The whole of the next day was spent in preparations for departure	287.72857875224827
DArtagnan went to take leave of M	12.481899993487453
At that time it was believed that the separation of the Musketeers and the Guards would be but momentary the king holding his Parliament that very day and proposing to set out the day after	313.80044208738883
de Trville contented himself with asking DArtagnan if he could do anything for him but DArtagnan answered that he was supplied with all he wanted	198.8313524881003
That night brought together all those comrades of the Guards of M	219.77071552439588
Dessessart and the company of Musketeers of M	1364.7381981062947
de Trville who had been accustomed to associate together	1074.2402590049421
They were parting to meet again when it pleased God and if it pleased God	392.63672554103147
That night then was somewhat riotous as may be imagined	1136.3020233273608
In such cases extreme preoccupation is only to be combated by extreme carelessness	650.7060346435178
At the first sound of the morning trumpet the friends separated the Musketeers hastening to the htel of M	492.553940797476
de Trville the Guards to that of M	106.51780478187615
Each of the captains then led his company to the Louvre where the king held his review	174.96140282677968
The king was dull and appeared ill which detracted a little from his usual lofty bearing	1918.5948020296178
In fact the evening before a fever had seized him in the midst of the Parliament while he was holding his Bed of Justice	150.70198881100526
He had not the less decided upon setting out that same evening and in spite of the remonstrances that had been offered to him he persisted in having the review hoping by setting it at defiance to conquer the disease which began to lay hold upon him	345.99716961556504
The review over the Guards set forward alone on their march the Musketeers waiting for the king which allowed Porthos time to go and take a turn in his superb equipment in the Rue aux Ours	450.27560857707573
The procurators wife saw him pass in his new uniform and on his fine horse	142.59203860235982
She loved Porthos too dearly to allow him to part thus she made him a sign to dismount and come to her	124.42732824376344
Porthos was magnificent his spurs jingled his cuirass glittered his sword knocked proudly against his ample limbs	2397.408538674571
This time the clerks evinced no inclination to laugh such a real ear clipper did Porthos appear	1473.9997193584666
The Musketeer was introduced to M	178.44873772172292
Coquenard whose little gray eyes sparkled with anger at seeing his cousin all blazing new	381.1379035000179
Nevertheless one thing afforded him inward consolation it was expected by everybody that the campaign would be a severe one	328.2127673987695
He whispered a hope to himself that this beloved relative might be killed in the field	207.24390114032084
Porthos paid his compliments to M	82.89291633158675
Coquenard wished him all sorts of prosperities	589.1873764593503
Coquenard she could not restrain her tears but no evil impressions were taken from her grief as she was known to be very much attached to her relatives about whom she was constantly having serious disputes with her husband	325.4601245579331
But the real adieux were made in Mme	1739.3562149493143
As long as the procurators wife could follow him with her eyes she waved her handkerchief to him leaning so far out of the window as to lead people to believe she wished to precipitate herself	205.15668636107944
Porthos received all these attentions like a man accustomed to such demonstrations only on turning the corner of the street he lifted his hat gracefully and waved it to her as a sign of adieu	132.64208490747504
On his part Aramis wrote a long letter	261.30624201691916
Kitty who was to set out that evening for Tours was waiting in the next chamber	194.96370802142638
Athos sipped the last bottle of his Spanish wine	189.57563053973587
In the meantime DArtagnan was defiling with his company	627.1388394379392
Antoine he turned round to look gaily at the Bastille but as it was the Bastille alone he looked at he did not observe Milady who mounted upon a light chestnut horse designated him with her finger to two illlooking men who came close up to the ranks to take notice of him	318.1702157370989
To a look of interrogation which they made Milady replied by a sign that it was he	141.73232064192524
Then certain that there could be no mistake in the execution of her orders she started her horse and disappeared	81.83160766291876
The two men followed the company and on leaving the Faubourg St	168.53376715972817
Antoine mounted two horses properly equipped which a servant without livery had waiting for them	1200.9489378345909
The Siege of La Rochelle was one of the great political events of the reign of Louis XIII	97.87511400556053
and one of the great military enterprises of the cardinal	818.4051846049268
It is then interesting and even necessary that we should say a few words about it particularly as many details of this siege are connected in too important a manner with the story we have undertaken to relate to allow us to pass it over in silence	194.00715008901608
The political plans of the cardinal when he undertook this siege were extensive	2813.4121243500645
Let us unfold them first and then pass on to the private plans which perhaps had not less influence upon his Eminence than the others	255.07185195330186
Of the important cities given up by Henry IV	523.745842941115
to the Huguenots as places of safety there only remained La Rochelle	1317.694161628495
It became necessary therefore to destroy this last bulwark of Calvinisma dangerous leaven with which the ferments of civil revolt and foreign war were constantly mingling	1621.6822219185005
Spaniards Englishmen and Italian malcontents adventurers of all nations and soldiers of fortune of every sect flocked at the first summons under the standard of the Protestants and organized themselves like a vast association whose branches diverged freely over all parts of Europe	674.9843222578475
La Rochelle which had derived a new importance from the ruin of the other Calvinist cities was then the focus of dissensions and ambition	355.0539571282622
Moreover its port was the last in the kingdom of France open to the English and by closing it against England our eternal enemy the cardinal completed the work of Joan of Arc and the Duc de Guise	368.77265128676146
Thus Bassompierre who was at once Protestant and CatholicProtestant by conviction and Catholic as commander of the order of the Holy Ghost Bassompierre who was a German by birth and a Frenchman at heartin short Bassompierre who had a distinguished command at the siege of La Rochelle said in charging at the head of several other Protestant nobles like himself You will see gentlemen that we shall be fools enough to take La Rochelle	605.6496164344414
The cannonade of the Isle of R presaged to him the dragonnades of the Cvennes the taking of La Rochelle was the preface to the revocation of the Edict of Nantes	259.6506229518127
We have hinted that by the side of these views of the leveling and simplifying minister which belong to history the chronicler is forced to recognize the lesser motives of the amorous man and jealous rival	543.9186028265572
Richelieu as everyone knows had loved the queen	275.5096843404701
Was this love a simple political affair or was it naturally one of those profound passions which Anne of Austria inspired in those who approached her That we are not able to say but at all events we have seen by the anterior developments of this story that Buckingham had the advantage over him and in two or three circumstances particularly that of the diamond studs had thanks to the devotedness of the three Musketeers and the courage and conduct of DArtagnan cruelly mystified him	295.5033511432738
It was then Richelieus object not only to get rid of an enemy of France but to avenge himself on a rival but this vengeance must be grand and striking and worthy in every way of a man who held in his hand as his weapon for combat the forces of a kingdom	111.58316299086172
Richelieu knew that in combating England he combated Buckingham that in triumphing over England he triumphed over Buckinghamin short that in humiliating England in the eyes of Europe he humiliated Buckingham in the eyes of the queen	1265.5679495012305
On his side Buckingham in pretending to maintain the honor of England was moved by interests exactly like those of the cardinal	380.92075128752225
Buckingham also was pursuing a private vengeance	4025.594632267351
Buckingham could not under any pretense be admitted into France as an ambassador he wished to enter it as a conqueror	265.26286401497026
It resulted from this that the real stake in this game which two most powerful kingdoms played for the good pleasure of two amorous men was simply a kind look from Anne of Austria	524.9947484858494
The first advantage had been gained by Buckingham	1298.7051051501448
Arriving unexpectedly in sight of the Isle of R with ninety vessels and nearly twenty thousand men he had surprised the Comte de Toiras who commanded for the king in the Isle and he had after a bloody conflict effected his landing	430.7033720071935
Allow us to observe in passing that in this fight perished the Baron de Chantal that the Baron de Chantal left a little orphan girl eighteen months old and that this little girl was afterward Mme	592.1148382449447
The Comte de Toiras retired into the citadel St	2470.9024069224215
Martin with his garrison and threw a hundred men into a little fort called the fort of La Pre	321.38667268480975
This event had hastened the resolutions of the cardinal and till the king and he could take the command of the siege of La Rochelle which was determined he had sent Monsieur to direct the first operations and had ordered all the troops he could dispose of to march toward the theater of war	198.73715407538322
It was of this detachment sent as a vanguard that our friend DArtagnan formed a part	759.3490377812019
The king as we have said was to follow as soon as his Bed of Justice had been held but on rising from his Bed of Justice on the twentyeighth of June he felt himself attacked by fever	335.3360613810092
He was notwithstanding anxious to set out but his illness becoming more serious he was forced to stop at Villeroy	293.9561457858841
Now whenever the king halted the Musketeers halted	4141.756217767493
It followed that DArtagnan who was as yet purely and simply in the Guards found himself for the time at least separated from his good friendsAthos Porthos and Aramis	401.74965469441855
This separation which was no more than an unpleasant circumstance would have certainly become a cause of serious uneasiness if he had been able to guess by what unknown dangers he was surrounded	165.60196492765166
He however arrived without accident in the camp established before La Rochelle on the tenth of the month of September of the year 1627	312.39472606758756
Everything was in the same state	287.3877660578026
The Duke of Buckingham and his English masters of the Isle of R continued to besiege but without success the citadel St	1478.214912838676
Martin and the fort of La Pre and hostilities with La Rochelle had commenced two or three days before about a fort which the Duc dAngoulme had caused to be constructed near the city	509.44750518123607
The Guards under the command of M	14.788500036530662
Dessessart took up their quarters at the Minimes but as we know DArtagnan possessed with ambition to enter the Musketeers had formed but few friendships among his comrades and he felt himself isolated and given up to his own reflections	431.85256123542626
His reflections were not very cheerful	2394.746268965304
From the time of his arrival in Paris he had been mixed up with public affairs but his own private affairs had made no great progress either in love or fortune	206.10201569998955
As to love the only woman he could have loved was Mme	561.5825858354793
Bonacieux had disappeared without his being able to discover what had become of her	73.86367521689206
As to fortune he had madehe humble as he wasan enemy of the cardinal that is to say of a man before whom trembled the greatest men of the kingdom beginning with the king	298.5280041666052
That man had the power to crush him and yet he had not done so	37.48360480461376
For a mind so perspicuous as that of DArtagnan this indulgence was a light by which he caught a glimpse of a better future	263.4623420656576
Then he had made himself another enemy less to be feared he thought but nevertheless he instinctively felt not to be despised	353.5777753006567
In exchange for all this he had acquired the protection and good will of the queen but the favor of the queen was at the present time an additional cause of persecution and her protection as it was known protected badlyas witness Chalais and Mme	348.05806745339555
What he had clearly gained in all this was the diamond worth five or six thousand livres which he wore on his finger and even this diamondsupposing that DArtagnan in his projects of ambition wished to keep it to make it someday a pledge for the gratitude of the queenhad not in the meanwhile since he could not part with it more value than the gravel he trod under his feet	182.92638061786977
We say the gravel he trod under his feet for DArtagnan made these reflections while walking solitarily along a pretty little road which led from the camp to the village of Angoutin	427.8050807355635
Now these reflections had led him further than he intended and the day was beginning to decline when by the last ray of the setting sun he thought he saw the barrel of a musket glitter from behind a hedge	179.0969512532543
DArtagnan had a quick eye and a prompt understanding	1142.148005867083
He comprehended that the musket had not come there of itself and that he who bore it had not concealed himself behind a hedge with any friendly intentions	276.7308582618349
He determined therefore to direct his course as clear from it as he could when on the opposite side of the road from behind a rock he perceived the extremity of another musket	137.15185010898915
The young man cast a glance at the first musket and saw with a certain degree of inquietude that it was leveled in his direction but as soon as he perceived that the orifice of the barrel was motionless he threw himself upon the ground	85.6881703417381
At the same instant the gun was fired and he heard the whistling of a ball pass over his head	63.17722750107531
No time was to be lost	494.2672499023674
DArtagnan sprang up with a bound and at the same instant the ball from the other musket tore up the gravel on the very spot on the road where he had thrown himself with his face to the ground	62.9204454515439
DArtagnan was not one of those foolhardy men who seek a ridiculous death in order that it may be said of them that they did not retreat a single step	124.64552982644393
Besides courage was out of the question here DArtagnan had fallen into an ambush	382.1110279030136
If there is a third shot said he to himself I am a lost man	113.45268465837802
He immediately therefore took to his heels and ran toward the camp with the swiftness of the young men of his country so renowned for their agility but whatever might be his speed the first who fired having had time to reload fired a second shot and this time so well aimed that it struck his hat and carried it ten paces from him	268.00317627138736
As he however had no other hat he picked up this as he ran and arrived at his quarters very pale and quite out of breath	205.94352088300695
He sat down without saying a word to anybody and began to reflect	130.0267674965989
This event might have three causes	186080.20460796525
The first and the most natural was that it might be an ambuscade of the Rochellais who might not be sorry to kill one of his Majestys Guards because it would be an enemy the less and this enemy might have a wellfurnished purse in his pocket	184.1472826818536
DArtagnan took his hat examined the hole made by the ball and shook his head	88.28928433961887
The ball was not a musket ballit was an arquebus ball	5403.96257265146
The accuracy of the aim had first given him the idea that a special weapon had been employed	208.9619721014464
This could not then be a military ambuscade as the ball was not of the regular caliber	749.0495753605393
This might be a kind remembrance of Monsieur the Cardinal	510.01127858545914
It may be observed that at the very moment when thanks to the ray of the sun he perceived the gun barrel he was thinking with astonishment on the forbearance of his Eminence with respect to him	173.86386917237022
But DArtagnan again shook his head	1.6611790966342121
For people toward whom he had but to put forth his hand his Eminence had rarely recourse to such means	438.54366076373236
It might be a vengeance of Milady that was most probable	562.0068735671892
He tried in vain to remember the faces or dress of the assassins he had escaped so rapidly that he had not had leisure to notice anything	223.01113599949258
Ah my poor friends murmured DArtagnan where are you And that you should fail me	176.2417201921098
DArtagnan passed a very bad night	11.30010838081122
Three or four times he started up imagining that a man was approaching his bed for the purpose of stabbing him	244.56808281171246
Nevertheless day dawned without darkness having brought any accident	1255.9643707843736
But DArtagnan well suspected that that which was deferred was not relinquished	632.2972103847301
DArtagnan remained all day in his quarters assigning as a reason to himself that the weather was bad	484.980853436065
At nine oclock the next morning the drums beat to arms	812.1885698158294
The Duc dOrlans visited the posts	13709.346834505062
The guards were under arms and DArtagnan took his place in the midst of his comrades	42.03421087170691
Monsieur passed along the front of the line then all the superior officers approached him to pay their compliments M	125.71614140165204
Dessessart captain of the Guards as well as the others	29.486383458027802
At the expiration of a minute or two it appeared to DArtagnan that M	277.34644430472446
Dessessart made him a sign to approach	186.7382598262844
He waited for a fresh gesture on the part of his superior for fear he might be mistaken but this gesture being repeated he left the ranks and advanced to receive orders	119.79584633999056
Monsieur is about to ask for some men of good will for a dangerous mission but one which will do honor to those who shall accomplish it and I made you a sign in order that you might hold yourself in readiness	126.33602609485786
Thanks my captain replied DArtagnan who wished for nothing better than an opportunity to distinguish himself under the eye of the lieutenant general	127.05030540419212
In fact the Rochellais had made a sortie during the night and had retaken a bastion of which the royal army had gained possession two days before	237.10606283230487
The matter was to ascertain by reconnoitering how the enemy guarded this bastion	3606.7283896687986
At the end of a few minutes Monsieur raised his voice and said I want for this mission three or four volunteers led by a man who can be depended upon	175.55672933604362
As to the man to be depended upon I have him under my hand monsieur said M	203.07603656385925
Dessessart pointing to DArtagnan and as to the four or five volunteers Monsieur has but to make his intentions known and the men will not be wanting	253.75327500204122
Four men of good will who will risk being killed with me said DArtagnan raising his sword	258.7244568257382
Two of his comrades of the Guards immediately sprang forward and two other soldiers having joined them the number was deemed sufficient	884.9716788477169
DArtagnan declined all others being unwilling to take the first chance from those who had the priority	146.95377059488882
It was not known whether after the taking of the bastion the Rochellais had evacuated it or left a garrison in it the object then was to examine the place near enough to verify the reports	421.9835954954878
DArtagnan set out with his four companions and followed the trench the two Guards marched abreast with him and the two soldiers followed behind	425.0966410971122
They arrived thus screened by the lining of the trench till they came within a hundred paces of the bastion	196.18740015830812
There on turning round DArtagnan perceived that the two soldiers had disappeared	93.43702800279732
He thought that beginning to be afraid they had stayed behind and he continued to advance	175.76944121082232
At the turning of the counterscarp they found themselves within about sixty paces of the bastion	505.1428709783184
They saw no one and the bastion seemed abandoned	2877.9091275725627
The three composing our forlorn hope were deliberating whether they should proceed any further when all at once a circle of smoke enveloped the giant of stone and a dozen balls came whistling around DArtagnan and his companions	599.335258094415
They knew all they wished to know the bastion was guarded	255.3153867971102
A longer stay in this dangerous spot would have been useless imprudence	710.8716985991153
DArtagnan and his two companions turned their backs and commenced a retreat which resembled a flight	661.9559900530622
On arriving at the angle of the trench which was to serve them as a rampart one of the Guardsmen fell	117.22578342087972
A ball had passed through his breast	55.29938743175978
The other who was safe and sound continued his way toward the camp	242.18609979389382
DArtagnan was not willing to abandon his companion thus and stooped to raise him and assist him in regaining the lines but at this moment two shots were fired	289.3734807031696
One ball struck the head of the alreadywounded guard and the other flattened itself against a rock after having passed within two inches of DArtagnan	292.60856713785705
The young man turned quickly round for this attack could not have come from the bastion which was hidden by the angle of the trench	118.30184498875438
The idea of the two soldiers who had abandoned him occurred to his mind and with them he remembered the assassins of two evenings before	142.08319274946675
He resolved this time to know with whom he had to deal and fell upon the body of his comrade as if he were dead	69.41056148104553
He quickly saw two heads appear above an abandoned work within thirty paces of him they were the heads of the two soldiers	403.46680168535676
DArtagnan had not been deceived these two men had only followed for the purpose of assassinating him hoping that the young mans death would be placed to the account of the enemy	77.92585891955075
As he might be only wounded and might denounce their crime they came up to him with the purpose of making sure	209.96457051874694
Fortunately deceived by DArtagnans trick they neglected to reload their guns	1844.2928571218079
When they were within ten paces of him DArtagnan who in falling had taken care not to let go his sword sprang up close to them	409.4369160627997
The assassins comprehended that if they fled toward the camp without having killed their man they should be accused by him therefore their first idea was to join the enemy	361.69619351190806
One of them took his gun by the barrel and used it as he would a club	273.8722125323739
He aimed a terrible blow at DArtagnan who avoided it by springing to one side but by this movement he left a passage free to the bandit who darted off toward the bastion	322.4342508371202
As the Rochellais who guarded the bastion were ignorant of the intentions of the man they saw coming toward them they fired upon him and he fell struck by a ball which broke his shoulder	183.97491486605824
Meantime DArtagnan had thrown himself upon the other soldier attacking him with his sword	113.59073301488525
The conflict was not long the wretch had nothing to defend himself with but his discharged arquebus	594.3117566946054
The sword of the Guardsman slipped along the barrel of the nowuseless weapon and passed through the thigh of the assassin who fell	228.3863208923477
DArtagnan immediately placed the point of his sword at his throat	31.007697294110518
Oh do not kill me cried the bandit	152.03292735713228
Pardon pardon my officer and I will tell you all	8.720481029471129
Is your secret of enough importance to me to spare your life for it asked the young man withholding his arm	85.84019979765681
Yes if you think existence worth anything to a man of twenty as you are and who may hope for everything being handsome and brave as you are	181.0067630316912
Wretch cried DArtagnan speak quickly Who employed you to assassinate me	746.3744523532316
A woman whom I do nt know but who is called Milady	246.18828233218278
But if you do nt know this woman how do you know her name	61.854088360296586
My comrade knows her and called her so	184.67406949469193
It was with him she agreed and not with me he even has in his pocket a letter from that person who attaches great importance to you as I have heard him say	179.38966683495494
But how did you become concerned in this villainous affair	922.491842606503
He proposed to me to undertake it with him and I agreed	201.461773844839
And how much did she give you for this fine enterprise	375.3584662064242
Well come said the young man laughing she thinks I am worth something	300.0559119347329
A hundred louis Well that was a temptation for two wretches like you	381.5421796174572
I understand why you accepted it and I grant you my pardon but upon one condition	197.42356107360726
What is that said the soldier uneasy at perceiving that all was not over	494.17625768532537
That you will go and fetch me the letter your comrade has in his pocket	182.44002167361603
But cried the bandit that is only another way of killing me	123.82113758363981
How can I go and fetch that letter under the fire of the bastion	190.42063702181804
You must nevertheless make up your mind to go and get it or I swear you shall die by my hand	43.646337545587954
Pardon monsieur pity In the name of that young lady you love and whom you perhaps believe dead but who is not cried the bandit throwing himself upon his knees and leaning upon his handfor he began to lose his strength with his blood	85.654433131017
And how do you know there is a young woman whom I love and that I believed that woman dead asked DArtagnan	103.64726969482788
By that letter which my comrade has in his pocket	129.59714590494346
You see then said DArtagnan that I must have that letter	71.70581184560187
So no more delay no more hesitation or else whatever may be my repugnance to soiling my sword a second time with the blood of a wretch like you I swear by my faith as an honest man and at these words DArtagnan made so fierce a gesture that the wounded man sprang up	209.9171154404261
Stop stop cried he regaining strength by force of terror	669.4421729941699
DArtagnan took the soldiers arquebus made him go on before him and urged him toward his companion by pricking him behind with his sword	187.24703172134932
It was a frightful thing to see this wretch leaving a long track of blood on the ground he passed over pale with approaching death trying to drag himself along without being seen to the body of his accomplice which lay twenty paces from him	197.82304341778496
Terror was so strongly painted on his face covered with a cold sweat that DArtagnan took pity on him and casting upon him a look of contempt Stop said he I will show you the difference between a man of courage and such a coward as you	101.39404019603997
Stay where you are I will go myself	61.47771522592842
And with a light step an eye on the watch observing the movements of the enemy and taking advantage of the accidents of the ground DArtagnan succeeded in reaching the second soldier	193.42386295582247
There were two means of gaining his objectto search him on the spot or to carry him away making a buckler of his body and search him in the trench	293.32330610708493
DArtagnan preferred the second means and lifted the assassin onto his shoulders at the moment the enemy fired	356.60347700592615
A slight shock the dull noise of three balls which penetrated the flesh a last cry a convulsion of agony proved to DArtagnan that the wouldbe assassin had saved his life	437.56586195076426
DArtagnan regained the trench and threw the corpse beside the wounded man who was as pale as death	49.92121047831408
A leather pocketbook a purse in which was evidently a part of the sum which the bandit had received with a dice box and dice completed the possessions of the dead man	196.22280679288826
He left the box and dice where they fell threw the purse to the wounded man and eagerly opened the pocketbook	422.229415145609
Among some unimportant papers he found the following letter that which he had sought at the risk of his life	53.91581669063644
Since you have lost sight of that woman and she is now in safety in the convent which you should never have allowed her to reach try at least not to miss the man	140.85848500774753
If you do you know that my hand stretches far and that you shall pay very dearly for the hundred louis you have from me	230.45994075213196
Nevertheless it was plain the letter came from Milady	2849.199605407792
He consequently kept it as a piece of evidence and being in safety behind the angle of the trench he began to interrogate the wounded man	134.59948571147785
He confessed that he had undertaken with his comradethe same who was killedto carry off a young woman who was to leave Paris by the Barrire de La Villette but having stopped to drink at a cabaret they had missed the carriage by ten minutes	399.6553615968262
But what were you to do with that woman asked DArtagnan with anguish	143.5668006123575
We were to have conveyed her to a htel in the Place Royale said the wounded man	103.12467202409694
Yes yes murmured DArtagnan that s the placeMiladys own residence	5661.721669788801
Then the young man tremblingly comprehended what a terrible thirst for vengeance urged this woman on to destroy him as well as all who loved him and how well she must be acquainted with the affairs of the court since she had discovered all	189.15414668367438
There could be no doubt she owed this information to the cardinal	204.6012103539811
But amid all this he perceived with a feeling of real joy that the queen must have discovered the prison in which poor Mme	169.74504426274422
Bonacieux was explaining her devotion and that she had freed her from that prison and the letter he had received from the young woman and her passage along the road of Chaillot like an apparition were now explained	167.54392653201137
Then also as Athos had predicted it became possible to find Mme	1381.4431229120619
Bonacieux and a convent was not impregnable	3538.970985788127
This idea completely restored clemency to his heart	27.517489919811638
He turned toward the wounded man who had watched with intense anxiety all the various expressions of his countenance and holding out his arm to him said Come I will not abandon you thus	78.8700185575914
Lean upon me and let us return to the camp	92.8507766512547
Yes said the man who could scarcely believe in such magnanimity but is it not to have me hanged	181.65672503718744
You have my word said he for the second time I give you your life	31.875534624561137
The wounded man sank upon his knees to again kiss the feet of his preserver but DArtagnan who had no longer a motive for staying so near the enemy abridged the testimonials of his gratitude	283.5144233606335
The Guardsman who had returned at the first discharge announced the death of his four companions	153.25248389895327
They were therefore much astonished and delighted in the regiment when they saw the young man come back safe and sound	140.53541779179756
DArtagnan explained the sword wound of his companion by a sortie which he improvised	276.785695371457
He described the death of the other soldier and the perils they had encountered	261.77603400242145
This recital was for him the occasion of veritable triumph	785.8587449039502
The whole army talked of this expedition for a day and Monsieur paid him his compliments upon it	151.39331620863416
Besides this as every great action bears its recompense with it the brave exploit of DArtagnan resulted in the restoration of the tranquility he had lost	660.3808061210545
In fact DArtagnan believed that he might be tranquil as one of his two enemies was killed and the other devoted to his interests	85.19888709717728
This tranquillity proved one thingthat DArtagnan did not yet know Milady	1618.411223079486
After the most disheartening news of the kings health a report of his convalescence began to prevail in the camp and as he was very anxious to be in person at the siege it was said that as soon as he could mount a horse he would set forward	121.65674228603311
Meantime Monsieur who knew that from one day to the other he might expect to be removed from his command by the Duc dAngoulme by Bassompierre or by Schomberg who were all eager for his post did but little lost his days in wavering and did not dare to attempt any great enterprise to drive the English from the Isle of R where they still besieged the citadel St	380.00630384697604
Martin and the fort of La Pre as on their side the French were besieging La Rochelle	1133.3942572288413
DArtagnan as we have said had become more tranquil as always happens after a past danger particularly when the danger seems to have vanished	733.4569118097367
He only felt one uneasiness and that was at not hearing any tidings from his friends	272.17211094453535
But one morning at the commencement of the month of November everything was explained to him by this letter dated from Villeroy	298.979202536487
Athos Porthos and Aramis after having had an entertainment at my house and enjoying themselves very much created such a disturbance that the provost of the castle a rigid man has ordered them to be confined for some days but I accomplish the order they have given me by forwarding to you a dozen bottles of my Anjou wine with which they are much pleased	236.04581479118661
They are desirous that you should drink to their health in their favorite wine	356.3153522881225
I have done this and am monsieur with great respect	1051.586753456906
Your very humble and obedient servant GODEAU Purveyor of the Musketeers	7149.39913721082
That s all well cried DArtagnan	2061.619346704827
They think of me in their pleasures as I thought of them in my troubles	298.7024008838091
Well I will certainly drink to their health with all my heart but I will not drink alone	59.87173889988347
And DArtagnan went among those Guardsmen with whom he had formed greater intimacy than with the others to invite them to enjoy with him this present of delicious Anjou wine which had been sent him from Villeroy	409.4252471767737
One of the two Guardsmen was engaged that evening and another the next so the meeting was fixed for the day after that	176.77293462650383
DArtagnan on his return sent the twelve bottles of wine to the refreshment room of the Guards with strict orders that great care should be taken of it and then on the day appointed as the dinner was fixed for midday DArtagnan sent Planchet at nine in the morning to assist in preparing everything for the entertainment	331.62218102458434
Planchet very proud of being raised to the dignity of landlord thought he would make all ready like an intelligent man and with this view called in the assistance of the lackey of one of his masters guests named Fourreau and the false soldier who had tried to kill DArtagnan and who belonging to no corps had entered into the service of DArtagnan or rather of Planchet after DArtagnan had saved his life	213.25852152029086
The hour of the banquet being come the two guards arrived took their places and the dishes were arranged on the table	151.07324133404396
Planchet waited towel on arm Fourreau uncorked the bottles and Brisemont which was the name of the convalescent poured the wine which was a little shaken by its journey carefully into decanters	571.2376961161428
Of this wine the first bottle being a little thick at the bottom Brisemont poured the lees into a glass and DArtagnan desired him to drink it for the poor devil had not yet recovered his strength	179.0076321714829
The guests having eaten the soup were about to lift the first glass of wine to their lips when all at once the cannon sounded from Fort Louis and Fort Neuf	455.25600833165936
The Guardsmen imagining this to be caused by some unexpected attack either of the besieged or the English sprang to their swords	312.0869213580663
DArtagnan not less forward than they did likewise and all ran out in order to repair to their posts	310.03240520778974
But scarcely were they out of the room before they were made aware of the cause of this noise	53.211423147131455
Cries of Live the king Live the cardinal resounded on every side and the drums were beaten in all directions	460.5257168866054
In short the king impatient as has been said had come by forced marches and had that moment arrived with all his household and a reinforcement of ten thousand troops	412.8613333878271
His Musketeers proceeded and followed him	5.903670797515704
DArtagnan placed in line with his company saluted with an expressive gesture his three friends whose eyes soon discovered him and M	341.8463656704818
de Trville who detected him at once	34.75596349424739
The ceremony of reception over the four friends were soon in one anothers arms	274.2628116799833
Pardieu cried DArtagnan you could not have arrived in better time the dinner can not have had time to get cold Can it gentlemen added the young man turning to the two Guards whom he introduced to his friends	130.0970413524565
Ah ah said Porthos it appears we are feasting	1203.1003022114426
I hope said Aramis there are no women at your dinner	299.44518444596423
Is there any drinkable wine in your tavern asked Athos	332.03389425160236
Well pardieu there is yours my dear friend replied DArtagnan	93.24458725125301
You know very wellthe wine from the hills of Anjou	496.5960189467521
Yes I know what brand you are talking about	38.33319040365171
Well in the absence of champagne and chambertin you must content yourselves with that	839.3552529004178
And so connoisseurs in wine as we are we have sent you some Anjou wine said Porthos	332.09048746043715
Not exactly it is the wine that was sent by your order	370.09127365277067
On our account said the three Musketeers	50993.561104293316
Did you send this wine Aramis said Athos	1620.0619826920652
If it was not you it was your purveyor said DArtagnan	626.5707654640328
Yes your purveyor Godeauthe purveyor of the Musketeers	151.5586937095995
My faith never mind where it comes from said Porthos let us taste it and if it is good let us drink it	114.01068062839646
No said Athos do nt let us drink wine which comes from an unknown source	392.0266632290958
You are right Athos said DArtagnan	2885.0913987920403
Did none of you charge your purveyor Godeau to send me some wine	1328.2129266171391
No And yet you say he has sent you some as from us	130.87097021057505
Here is his letter said DArtagnan and he presented the note to his comrades	108.28789120218812
This is not his writing said Athos	312.5565175043474
I am acquainted with it before we left Villeroy I settled the accounts of the regiment	436.8777176094074
A false letter altogether said Porthos we have not been disciplined	242.5235119609261
DArtagnan said Aramis in a reproachful tone how could you believe that we had made a disturbance	181.64371873796284
DArtagnan grew pale and a convulsive trembling shook all his limbs	305.1678980195118
Thou alarmest me said Athos who never used thee and thou but upon very particular occasions what has happened	889.9211611733773
Look you my friends cried DArtagnan a horrible suspicion crosses my mind Can this be another vengeance of that woman	1670.8385003098867
It was now Athos who turned pale	91.2166636233457
DArtagnan rushed toward the refreshment room the three Musketeers and the two Guards following him	839.3633999614801
The first object that met the eyes of DArtagnan on entering the room was Brisemont stretched upon the ground and rolling in horrible convulsions	234.6881572820278
Planchet and Fourreau as pale as death were trying to give him succor but it was plain that all assistance was uselessall the features of the dying man were distorted with agony	153.31885773914527
Ah cried he on perceiving DArtagnan ah this is frightful You pretend to pardon me and you poison me	685.6289621553748
I wretch What do you say	53.90538072762877
I say that it was you who gave me the wine I say that it was you who desired me to drink it	54.024484916655794
I say you wished to avenge yourself on me and I say that it is horrible	37.541236506041926
Do not think so Brisemont said DArtagnan do not think so	58.90321697937822
I swear to you I protest	45060.709208423614
Oh but God is above God will punish you My God grant that he may one day suffer what I suffer	728.6882836545528
Upon the Gospel said DArtagnan throwing himself down by the dying man I swear to you that the wine was poisoned and that I was going to drink of it as you did	56.194323850281705
I do not believe you cried the soldier and he expired amid horrible tortures	1273.4428482097637
Frightful frightful murmured Athos while Porthos broke the bottles and Aramis gave orders a little too late that a confessor should be sent for	188.0111872776223
Oh my friends said DArtagnan you come once more to save my life not only mine but that of these gentlemen	104.71987642009795
Gentlemen continued he addressing the Guardsmen I request you will be silent with regard to this adventure	168.6637473898679
Great personages may have had a hand in what you have seen and if talked about the evil would only recoil upon us	262.63372195671025
Ah monsieur stammered Planchet more dead than alive ah monsieur what an escape I have had	716.8723319608424
How sirrah you were going to drink my wine	92.31046736990207
To the health of the king monsieur I was going to drink a small glass of it if Fourreau had not told me I was called	116.38395367650702
Alas said Fourreau whose teeth chattered with terror I wanted to get him out of the way that I might drink myself	103.6150204761152
Gentlemen said DArtagnan addressing the Guardsmen you may easily comprehend that such a feast can only be very dull after what has taken place so accept my excuses and put off the party till another day I beg of you	253.93859602396046
The two Guardsmen courteously accepted DArtagnans excuses and perceiving that the four friends desired to be alone retired	485.9069687039918
When the young Guardsman and the three Musketeers were without witnesses they looked at one another with an air which plainly expressed that each of them perceived the gravity of their situation	220.17624111175738
In the first place said Athos let us leave this chamber the dead are not agreeable company particularly when they have died a violent death	360.7954081545414
Planchet said DArtagnan I commit the corpse of this poor devil to your care	84.81849699503614
Let him be interred in holy ground	10849.183289048406
He committed a crime it is true but he repented of it	88.50826104848099
And the four friends quit the room leaving to Planchet and Fourreau the duty of paying mortuary honors to Brisemont	1098.4779427973078
The host gave them another chamber and served them with fresh eggs and some water which Athos went himself to draw at the fountain	498.8429230110278
In a few words Porthos and Aramis were posted as to the situation	178.32083598252424
Well said DArtagnan to Athos you see my dear friend that this is war to the death	69.77520906502455
Yes yes replied he I perceive that plainly but do you really believe it is she	118.27731103528961
Nevertheless I confess I still doubt	1735.2191706921408
But the fleurdelis on her shoulder	132.8621056124184
She is some Englishwoman who has committed a crime in France and has been branded in consequence	102.09676406005134
Athos she is your wife I tell you repeated DArtagnan only reflect how much the two descriptions resemble each other	627.4580656851754
Yes but I should think the other must be dead I hanged her so effectually	323.90960190168653
It was DArtagnan who now shook his head in his turn	30.432360633477355
But in either case what is to be done said the young man	8.41577659697401
The fact is one can not remain thus with a sword hanging eternally over his head said Athos	503.86946530770854
We must extricate ourselves from this position	377.204836218005
Listen You must try to see her and have an explanation with her	93.92556267002823
Say to her Peace or war My word as a gentleman never to say anything of you never to do anything against you on your side a solemn oath to remain neutral with respect to me	277.9767340495309
If not I will apply to the chancellor I will apply to the king I will apply to the hangman I will move the courts against you I will denounce you as branded I will bring you to trial and if you are acquitted well by the faith of a gentleman I will kill you at the corner of some wall as I would a mad dog	121.94056179398294
I like the means well enough said DArtagnan but where and how to meet with her	193.81771339664357
Time dear friend time brings round opportunity opportunity is the martingale of man	1467.9161148446692
The more we have ventured the more we gain when we know how to wait	209.37834239607182
Yes but to wait surrounded by assassins and poisoners	3631.8285260052367
God has preserved us hitherto God will preserve us still	356.2034009914537
Besides we are men and everything considered it is our lot to risk our lives but she asked he in an undertone	203.0807966851342
Madame Bonacieux Ah that s true said Athos	2317.440299505343
My poor friend I had forgotten you were in love	95.88017562264885
Well but said Aramis have you not learned by the letter you found on the wretched corpse that she is in a convent One may be very comfortable in a convent and as soon as the siege of La Rochelle is terminated I promise you on my part	141.17658833656404
Good cried Athos good Yes my dear Aramis we all know that your views have a religious tendency	951.250321414303
I am only temporarily a Musketeer said Aramis humbly	5860.255607418893
It is some time since we heard from his mistress said Athos in a low voice	54.064504657692915
But take no notice we know all about that	113.45962435002389
Well said Porthos it appears to me that the means are very simple	39.577999755714046
You say she is in a convent replied Porthos	329.170065290058
As soon as the siege is over well carry her off from that convent	1275.2423474271425
But we must first learn what convent she is in	351.8221866676948
But I think I have it said Athos	100.71139096302718
Do nt you say dear DArtagnan that it is the queen who has made choice of the convent for her	153.7509296697876
In that case Porthos will assist us	134.52657595251188
And how so if you please	15.508438076145369
Why by your marchioness your duchess your princess	3222.486404677674
She must have a long arm	3479.5170375451585
Hush said Porthos placing a finger on his lips	21.131055299789633
I believe her to be a cardinalist she must know nothing of the matter	214.88346593657067
Then said Aramis I take upon myself to obtain intelligence of her	203.4139725216016
You Aramis cried the three friends	57.61771928035217
By the queens almoner to whom I am very intimately allied said Aramis coloring	808.9300167377172
And on this assurance the four friends who had finished their modest repast separated with the promise of meeting again that evening	239.01905946588818
DArtagnan returned to less important affairs and the three Musketeers repaired to the kings quarters where they had to prepare their lodging	593.9656862757183
THE SIGN OF THE RED DOVECOT	10123.14794321849
Meanwhile the king who with more reason than the cardinal showed his hatred for Buckingham although scarcely arrived was in such a haste to meet the enemy that he commanded every disposition to be made to drive the English from the Isle of R and afterward to press the siege of La Rochelle but notwithstanding his earnest wish he was delayed by the dissensions which broke out between MM	360.9903794532703
Bassompierre and Schomberg against the Duc dAngoulme	75520.37053185735
Bassompierre and Schomberg were marshals of France and claimed their right of commanding the army under the orders of the king but the cardinal who feared that Bassompierre a Huguenot at heart might press but feebly the English and Rochellais his brothers in religion supported the Duc dAngoulme whom the king at his instigation had named lieutenant general	1044.1461382462282
The result was that to prevent MM	16988.219003274437
Bassompierre and Schomberg from deserting the army a separate command had to be given to each	392.9419746442507
Bassompierre took up his quarters on the north of the city between Leu and Dompierre the Duc dAngoulme on the east from Dompierre to Perigny and M	917.6671989659194
de Schomberg on the south from Perigny to Angoutin	3641.1907273113084
The quarters of Monsieur were at Dompierre the quarters of the king were sometimes at Estre sometimes at Jarrie the cardinals quarters were upon the downs at the bridge of La Pierre in a simple house without any entrenchment	966.620951386615
So that Monsieur watched Bassompierre the king the Duc dAngoulme and the cardinal M	738.1138504382324
As soon as this organization was established they set about driving the English from the Isle	383.33723792204654
The English who require above everything good living in order to be good soldiers only eating salt meat and bad biscuit had many invalids in their camp	1058.2330335276376
Still further the sea very rough at this period of the year all along the sea coast destroyed every day some little vessel and the shore from the point of lAiguillon to the trenches was at every tide literally covered with the wrecks of pinnacles roberges and feluccas	689.5626830051946
The result was that even if the kings troops remained quietly in their camp it was evident that some day or other Buckingham who only continued in the Isle from obstinacy would be obliged to raise the siege	368.5222213845599
de Toiras gave information that everything was preparing in the enemys camp for a fresh assault the king judged that it would be best to put an end to the affair and gave the necessary orders for a decisive action	254.61006834190655
As it is not our intention to give a journal of the siege but on the contrary only to describe such of the events of it as are connected with the story we are relating we will content ourselves with saying in two words that the expedition succeeded to the great astonishment of the king and the great glory of the cardinal	162.50109652256177
The English repulsed foot by foot beaten in all encounters and defeated in the passage of the Isle of Loie were obliged to reembark leaving on the field of battle two thousand men among whom were five colonels three lieutenant colonels two hundred and fifty captains twenty gentlemen of rank four pieces of cannon and sixty flags which were taken to Paris by Claude de St	623.4610017354978
Simon and suspended with great pomp in the arches of Notre Dame	352.4722828568545
Te Deums were chanted in camp and afterward throughout France	15551.84154016896
The cardinal was left free to carry on the siege without having at least at the present anything to fear on the part of the English	81.78033820272758
But it must be acknowledged this response was but momentary	3709.056286360781
An envoy of the Duke of Buckingham named Montague was taken and proof was obtained of a league between the German Empire Spain England and Lorraine	828.3145977763402
This league was directed against France	2116.2715118601654
Still further in Buckinghams lodging which he had been forced to abandon more precipitately than he expected papers were found which confirmed this alliance and which as the cardinal asserts in his memoirs strongly compromised Mme	741.7873644559519
de Chevreuse and consequently the queen	1392.964689299701
It was upon the cardinal that all the responsibility fell for one is not a despotic minister without responsibility	632.7876386585748
All therefore of the vast resources of his genius were at work night and day engaged in listening to the least report heard in any of the great kingdoms of Europe	381.51428314861045
The cardinal was acquainted with the activity and more particularly the hatred of Buckingham	445.5310403644876
If the league which threatened France triumphed all his influence would be lost	678.92201129391
Spanish policy and Austrian policy would have their representatives in the cabinet of the Louvre where they had as yet but partisans and he Richelieuthe French minister the national ministerwould be ruined	717.0680254721565
The king even while obeying him like a child hated him as a child hates his master and would abandon him to the personal vengeance of Monsieur and the queen	159.64739784357238
He would then be lost and France perhaps with him	444.6131551588691
All this must be prepared against	349.56597521598917
Courtiers becoming every instant more numerous succeeded one another day and night in the little house of the bridge of La Pierre in which the cardinal had established his residence	201.2138258108468
There were monks who wore the frock with such an ill grace that it was easy to perceive they belonged to the church militant women a little inconvenienced by their costume as pages and whose large trousers could not entirely conceal their rounded forms and peasants with blackened hands but with fine limbs savoring of the man of quality a league off	664.1600961319488
There were also less agreeable visitsfor two or three times reports were spread that the cardinal had nearly been assassinated	350.56881348485655
It is true that the enemies of the cardinal said that it was he himself who set these bungling assassins to work in order to have if wanted the right of using reprisals but we must not believe everything ministers say nor everything their enemies say	418.9557911917026
These attempts did not prevent the cardinal to whom his most inveterate detractors have never denied personal bravery from making nocturnal excursions sometimes to communicate to the Duc dAngoulme important orders sometimes to confer with the king and sometimes to have an interview with a messenger whom he did not wish to see at home	468.50167136623577
On their part the Musketeers who had not much to do with the siege were not under very strict orders and led a joyous life	206.6630643951329
This was the more easy for our three companions in particular for being friends of M	321.7182970384739
de Trville they obtained from him special permission to be absent after the closing of the camp	313.66362561713356
Now one evening when DArtagnan who was in the trenches was not able to accompany them Athos Porthos and Aramis mounted on their battle steeds enveloped in their war cloaks with their hands upon their pistol butts were returning from a drinking place called the Red Dovecot which Athos had discovered two days before upon the route to Jarrie following the road which led to the camp and quite on their guard as we have stated for fear of an ambuscade when about a quarter of a league from the village of Boisnau they fancied they heard the sound of horses approaching them	271.44242571656423
They immediately all three halted closed in and waited occupying the middle of the road	280.93846000647073
In an instant and as the moon broke from behind a cloud they saw at a turning of the road two horsemen who on perceiving them stopped in their turn appearing to deliberate whether they should continue their route or go back	283.04269155001305
The hesitation created some suspicion in the three friends and Athos advancing a few paces in front of the others cried in a firm voice Who goes there	180.73742452666818
Who goes there yourselves replied one of the horsemen	67.78412310708836
That is not an answer replied Athos	859.7339919449117
Who goes there Answer or we charge	1486.7846564852084
Beware of what you are about gentlemen said a clear voice which seemed accustomed to command	339.07291578573904
It is some superior officer making his night rounds said Athos	3361.0943506982508
Who are you said the same voice in the same commanding tone	128.62329256693548
Answer in your turn or you may repent of your disobedience	545.0646833512877
Kings Musketeers said Athos more and more convinced that he who interrogated them had the right to do so	100.27636218753369
Advance and give an account of what you are doing here at this hour	39.483773239291445
The three companions advanced rather humblyfor all were now convinced that they had to do with someone more powerful than themselvesleaving Athos the post of speaker	562.3434240380758
One of the two riders he who had spoken second was ten paces in front of his companion	138.49418920944407
Athos made a sign to Porthos and Aramis also to remain in the rear and advanced alone	201.4388606293406
Your pardon my officer said Athos but we were ignorant with whom we had to do and you may see that we were keeping good guard	167.78906741237014
Your name said the officer who covered a part of his face with his cloak	58.62443908608116
But yourself monsieur said Athos who began to be annoyed by this inquisition give me I beg you the proof that you have the right to question me	95.13794401233221
Your name repeated the cavalier a second time letting his cloak fall and leaving his face uncovered	522.9273934802546
Monsieur the Cardinal cried the stupefied Musketeer	124821.09905889598
Your name cried his Eminence for the third time	27.997616329646682
The cardinal made a sign to his attendant who drew near	79.10588589265973
These three Musketeers shall follow us said he in an undertone	39.96744194264617
I am not willing it should be known I have left the camp and if they follow us we shall be certain they will tell nobody	134.03767479300848
We are gentlemen monseigneur said Athos require our parole and give yourself no uneasiness	2847.2721906413854
Thank God we can keep a secret	64.56593432305863
The cardinal fixed his piercing eyes on this courageous speaker	770.6990824506705
You have a quick ear Monsieur Athos said the cardinal but now listen to this	289.82079356917626
It is not from mistrust that I request you to follow me but for my security	64.19584740338436
Your companions are no doubt Messieurs Porthos and Aramis	3199.512753905601
Yes your Eminence said Athos while the two Musketeers who had remained behind advanced hat in hand	368.96417268684866
I know you gentlemen said the cardinal I know you	38.465037359717186
I know you are not quite my friends and I am sorry you are not so but I know you are brave and loyal gentlemen and that confidence may be placed in you	82.33160285194899
Monsieur Athos do me then the honor to accompany me you and your two friends and then I shall have an escort to excite envy in his Majesty if we should meet him	151.74921200621716
The three Musketeers bowed to the necks of their horses	97.05106614053003
Well upon my honor said Athos your Eminence is right in taking us with you we have seen several illlooking faces on the road and we have even had a quarrel at the Red Dovecot with four of those faces	284.8892738583088
A quarrel and what for gentlemen said the cardinal you know I do nt like quarrelers	189.07092230913622
And that is the reason why I have the honor to inform your Eminence of what has happened for you might learn it from others and upon a false account believe us to be in fault	170.3871331941837
What have been the results of your quarrel said the cardinal knitting his brow	213.03057601237626
My friend Aramis here has received a slight sword wound in the arm but not enough to prevent him as your Eminence may see from mounting to the assault tomorrow if your Eminence orders an escalade	630.3684262554834
But you are not the men to allow sword wounds to be inflicted upon you thus said the cardinal	917.6979918017237
Come be frank gentlemen you have settled accounts with somebody Confess you know I have the right of giving absolution	716.8195095666756
I did not even draw my sword but I took him who offended me round the body and threw him out of the window	82.53681702463405
It appears that in falling continued Athos with some hesitation he broke his thigh	983.9622920953695
Ah ah said the cardinal and you Monsieur Porthos	663.1827039276608
I monseigneur knowing that dueling is prohibitedI seized a bench and gave one of those brigands such a blow that I believe his shoulder is broken	324.39166245100296
Very well said the cardinal and you Monsieur Aramis	985.7227206802689
Monseigneur being of a very mild disposition and being likewise of which Monseigneur perhaps is not aware about to enter into orders I endeavored to appease my comrades when one of these wretches gave me a wound with a sword treacherously across my left arm	479.0510352448438
Then I admit my patience failed me I drew my sword in my turn and as he came back to the charge I fancied I felt that in throwing himself upon me he let it pass through his body	116.58231883214181
I only know for a certainty that he fell and it seemed to me that he was borne away with his two companions	95.2112849722568
The devil gentlemen said the cardinal three men placed hors de combat in a cabaret squabble You do nt do your work by halves	1593.1785789602222
And pray what was this quarrel about	1722.9992548348832
These fellows were drunk said Athos and knowing there was a lady who had arrived at the cabaret this evening they wanted to force her door	133.71239503259451
Force her door said the cardinal and for what purpose	258.5130027412946
To do her violence without doubt said Athos	447.6719232070031
I have had the honor of informing your Eminence that these men were drunk	771.7228667171906
And was this lady young and handsome asked the cardinal with a certain degree of anxiety	147.2417885438684
We did not see her monseigneur said Athos	6400.953719168314
You did not see her Ah very well replied the cardinal quickly	1061.0103186819003
You did well to defend the honor of a woman and as I am going to the Red Dovecot myself I shall know if you have told me the truth	55.978579437151865
Monseigneur said Athos haughtily we are gentlemen and to save our heads we would not be guilty of a falsehood	135.8719201334738
Therefore I do not doubt what you say Monsieur Athos I do not doubt it for a single instant but added he to change the conversation was this lady alone	132.88787963928294
The lady had a cavalier shut up with her said Athos but as notwithstanding the noise this cavalier did not show himself it is to be presumed that he is a coward	184.47109969694196
Judge not rashly says the Gospel replied the cardinal	2179.5829797135866
And now gentlemen that s well continued the cardinal	1396.2772543640522
I know what I wish to know follow me	132.8623788250513
The three Musketeers passed behind his Eminence who again enveloped his face in his cloak and put his horse in motion keeping from eight to ten paces in advance of his four companions	207.28462990536514
They soon arrived at the silent solitary inn	48787.074646259825
No doubt the host knew what illustrious visitor was expected and had consequently sent intruders out of the way	548.7175253678279
Ten paces from the door the cardinal made a sign to his esquire and the three Musketeers to halt	234.6753078384995
A saddled horse was fastened to the window shutter	156.66482948795144
The cardinal knocked three times and in a peculiar manner	54.21663864082842
A man enveloped in a cloak came out immediately and exchanged some rapid words with the cardinal after which he mounted his horse and set off in the direction of Surgres which was likewise the way to Paris	171.6051128494312
You have told me the truth my gentlemen said he addressing the Musketeers and it will not be my fault if our encounter this evening be not advantageous to you	195.76625340690512
The cardinal alighted the three Musketeers did likewise	23152.571036284477
The cardinal threw the bridle of his horse to his esquire the three Musketeers fastened the horses to the shutters	199.12498011494213
The host stood at the door	2.396726633707963
For him the cardinal was only an officer coming to visit a lady	272.0152382051073
Have you any chamber on the ground floor where these gentlemen can wait near a good fire said the cardinal	167.97290751922526
The host opened the door of a large room in which an old stove had just been replaced by a large and excellent chimney	165.92039077111914
That will do replied the cardinal	2780.249481524893
Enter gentlemen and be kind enough to wait for me I shall not be more than half an hour	18.448269567320033
And while the three Musketeers entered the ground floor room the cardinal without asking further information ascended the staircase like a man who has no need of having his road pointed out to him	257.67019411203245
It was evident that without suspecting it and actuated solely by their chivalrous and adventurous character our three friends had just rendered a service to someone the cardinal honored with his special protection	943.0017347606488
Now who was that someone That was the question the three Musketeers put to one another	359.83023948018376
Then seeing that none of their replies could throw any light on the subject Porthos called the host and asked for dice	683.6046796299169
Porthos and Aramis placed themselves at the table and began to play	34.77068974213474
Athos walked about in a contemplative mood	58377.18494506834
While thinking and walking Athos passed and repassed before the pipe of the stove broken in halves the other extremity passing into the chamber above and every time he passed and repassed he heard a murmur of words which at length fixed his attention	294.05095319733294
Athos went close to it and distinguished some words that appeared to merit so great an interest that he made a sign to his friends to be silent remaining himself bent with his ear directed to the opening of the lower orifice	149.20699532279903
Listen Milady said the cardinal the affair is important	203.14695175126926
Sit down and let us talk it over	232.77995012124606
I listen to your Eminence with greatest attention replied a female voice which made the Musketeer start	864.5400347054268
A small vessel with an English crew whose captain is on my side awaits you at the mouth of Charente at Fort La Pointe	538.2986368592034
He will set sail tomorrow morning	95.52305736363118
Fort La Pointe or Fort Vasou was not built until 1672 nearly 50 years later	10638.849757544971
Instantly That is to say when you have received my instructions	83.67692643933111
Two men whom you will find at the door on going out will serve you as escort	392.33087114593803
You will allow me to leave first then after half an hour you can go away in your turn	62.88548699320276
Now let us return to the mission with which you wish to charge me and as I desire to continue to merit the confidence of your Eminence deign to unfold it to me in terms clear and precise that I may not commit an error	178.91614012716272
There was an instant of profound silence between the two interlocutors	308.97702759626515
It was evident that the cardinal was weighing beforehand the terms in which he was about to speak and that Milady was collecting all her intellectual faculties to comprehend the things he was about to say and to engrave them in her memory when they should be spoken	210.5791609680985
Athos took advantage of this moment to tell his two companions to fasten the door inside and to make them a sign to come and listen with him	117.00257095199217
The two Musketeers who loved their ease brought a chair for each of themselves and one for Athos	405.45605813584035
All three then sat down with their heads together and their ears on the alert	165.66427057634695
You will go to London continued the cardinal	668.7154653291312
Arrived in London you will seek Buckingham	22215.84682902236
I must beg your Eminence to observe said Milady that since the affair of the diamond studs about which the duke always suspected me his Grace distrusts me	642.612325452455
Well this time said the cardinal it is not necessary to steal his confidence but to present yourself frankly and loyally as a negotiator	367.8376034226094
Frankly and loyally repeated Milady with an unspeakable expression of duplicity	231.02856040286838
Yes frankly and loyally replied the cardinal in the same tone	26.852586278639798
All this negotiation must be carried on openly	1112.982514828646
I will follow your Eminences instructions to the letter	185.68701884086082
I only wait till you give them	90.88334830921663
You will go to Buckingham in my behalf and you will tell him I am acquainted with all the preparations he has made but that they give me no uneasiness since at the first step he takes I will ruin the queen	108.74574281056306
Will he believe that your Eminence is in a position to accomplish the threat thus made	490.52779288224195
Yes for I have the proofs	4577.888868499677
I must be able to present these proofs for his appreciation	900.3239478166508
And you will tell him I will publish the report of BoisRobert and the Marquis de Beautru upon the interview which the duke had at the residence of Madame the Constable with the queen on the evening Madame the Constable gave a masquerade	367.31016732571993
You will tell him in order that he may not doubt that he came there in the costume of the Great Mogul which the Chevalier de Guise was to have worn and that he purchased this exchange for the sum of three thousand pistoles	130.65790548743658
All the details of his coming into and going out of the palaceon the night when he introduced himself in the character of an Italian fortune telleryou will tell him that he may not doubt the correctness of my information that he had under his cloak a large white robe dotted with black tears deaths heads and crossbonesfor in case of a surprise he was to pass for the phantom of the White Lady who as all the world knows appears at the Louvre every time any great event is impending	270.6363033937818
Tell him also that I am acquainted with all the details of the adventure at Amiens that I will have a little romance made of it wittily turned with a plan of the garden and portraits of the principal actors in that nocturnal romance	251.41494346359104
Tell him further that I hold Montague in my power that Montague is in the Bastille that no letters were found upon him it is true but that torture may make him tell much of what he knows and even what he does not know	239.1325694737694
Then add that his Grace has in the precipitation with which he quit the Isle of R forgotten and left behind him in his lodging a certain letter from Madame de Chevreuse which singularly compromises the queen inasmuch as it proves not only that her Majesty can love the enemies of the king but that she can conspire with the enemies of France	338.1358642146091
You recollect perfectly all I have told you do you not	17.36080718035896
Your Eminence will judge the ball of Madame the Constable the night at the Louvre the evening at Amiens the arrest of Montague the letter of Madame de Chevreuse	304.1756694741485
That s it said the cardinal that s it	345.5638435271258
You have an excellent memory Milady	765002.3041430677
But resumed she to whom the cardinal addressed this flattering compliment if in spite of all these reasons the duke does not give way and continues to menace France	447.609041139414
The duke is in love to madness or rather to folly replied Richelieu with great bitterness	1233.587743038008
Like the ancient paladins he has only undertaken this war to obtain a look from his lady love	502.31525430694984
If he becomes certain that this war will cost the honor and perhaps the liberty of the lady of his thoughts as he says I will answer for it he will look twice	126.10787724240117
And yet said Milady with a persistence that proved she wished to see clearly to the end of the mission with which she was about to be charged if he persists	141.52710420375044
If he persists said the cardinal	964.7238624628721
If he persists His Eminence made a pause and resumed If he persistswell then I shall hope for one of those events which change the destinies of states	346.46919840283795
If your Eminence would quote to me some one of these events in history said Milady perhaps I should partake of your confidence as to the future	217.13645816733344
Well here for example said Richelieu when in 1610 for a cause similar to that which moves the duke King Henry IV	1794.4357204629596
of glorious memory was about at the same time to invade Flanders and Italy in order to attack Austria on both sides	280.785441853818
Well did there not happen an event which saved Austria Why should not the king of France have the same chance as the emperor	238.33879205650655
Your Eminence means I presume the knife stab in the Rue de la Feronnerie	227.46094650881966
Does not your Eminence fear that the punishment inflicted upon Ravaillac may deter anyone who might entertain the idea of imitating him	869.4154027830347
There will be in all times and in all countries particularly if religious divisions exist in those countries fanatics who ask nothing better than to become martyrs	957.7033283367412
Ay and observeit just occurs to me that the Puritans are furious against Buckingham and their preachers designate him as the Antichrist	887.0004959569411
Well continued the cardinal in an indifferent tone the only thing to be sought for at this moment is some woman handsome young and clever who has cause of quarrel with the duke	252.88020363917883
The duke has had many affairs of gallantry and if he has fostered his amours by promises of eternal constancy he must likewise have sown the seeds of hatred by his eternal infidelities	964.0861479401038
No doubt said Milady coolly such a woman may be found	118.88073410764635
Well such a woman who would place the knife of Jacques Clment or of Ravaillac in the hands of a fanatic would save France	449.2647660751447
Yes but she would then be the accomplice of an assassination	129.24239945167764
Were the accomplices of Ravaillac or of Jacques Clment ever known	1390.088336357818
No for perhaps they were too highplaced for anyone to dare look for them where they were	301.32461428744887
The Palace of Justice would not be burned down for everybody monseigneur	838.5574700254456
You think then that the fire at the Palace of Justice was not caused by chance asked Richelieu in the tone with which he would have put a question of no importance	165.71152422518998
I think nothing I quote a fact that is all	62.70614766586323
Only I say that if I were named Madame de Montpensier or the Queen Marie de Mdicis I should use less precautions than I take being simply called Milady Clarik	803.0512662107267
I require an order which would ratify beforehand all that I should think proper to do for the greatest good of France	303.2803852344934
But in the first place this woman I have described must be found who is desirous of avenging herself upon the duke	316.8730679888973
Then the miserable fanatic must be found who will serve as an instrument of Gods justice	178.19416769124746
Well said the cardinal then it will be time to claim the order which you just now required	117.48971431460417
Your Eminence is right replied Milady and I have been wrong in seeing in the mission with which you honor me anything but that which it really isthat is to announce to his Grace on the part of your Eminence that you are acquainted with the different disguises by means of which he succeeded in approaching the queen during the fte given by Madame the Constable that you have proofs of the interview granted at the Louvre by the queen to a certain Italian astrologer who was no other than the Duke of Buckingham that you have ordered a little romance of a satirical nature to be written upon the adventures of Amiens with a plan of the gardens in which those adventures took place and portraits of the actors who figured in them that Montague is in the Bastille and that the torture may make him say things he remembers and even things he has forgotten that you possess a certain letter from Madame de Chevreuse found in his Graces lodging which singularly compromises not only her who wrote it but her in whose name it was written	238.30886178866098
Then if he persists notwithstanding all thisas that is as I have said the limit of my missionI shall have nothing to do but to pray God to work a miracle for the salvation of France	190.90549189801263
That is it is it not monseigneur and I shall have nothing else to do	42.4418548638803
That is it replied the cardinal dryly	25056.4714616825
And now said Milady without appearing to remark the change of the dukes tone toward hernow that I have received the instructions of your Eminence as concerns your enemies Monseigneur will permit me to say a few words to him of mine	258.21703421352163
Have you enemies then asked Richelieu	1584783.0218936512
Yes monseigneur enemies against whom you owe me all your support for I made them by serving your Eminence	228.22951325221595
Who are they replied the duke	1016.905568643341
In the first place there is a little intrigante named Bonacieux	999.1257205647544
She is in the prison of Nantes	1215.1632570322963
That is to say she was there replied Milady but the queen has obtained an order from the king by means of which she has been conveyed to a convent	139.26341196329324
To a convent said the duke	518.5387239608636
I do nt know the secret has been well kept	190.84251966856556
And your Eminence will tell me in what convent that woman is	210.4306693418114
I can see nothing inconvenient in that said the cardinal	72.19891721961798
Well now I have an enemy much more to be dreaded by me than this little Madame Bonacieux	453.58061312973365
Oh your Eminence knows him well cried Milady carried away by her anger	538.5966142483927
He is the evil genius of both of us	87.06392882425524
It is he who in an encounter with your Eminences Guards decided the victory in favor of the kings Musketeers it is he who gave three desperate wounds to De Wardes your emissary and who caused the affair of the diamond studs to fail it is he who knowing it was I who had Madame Bonacieux carried off has sworn my death	497.7073729061308
Ah ah said the cardinal I know of whom you speak	35.85969930781734
He is a bold fellow said the cardinal	63.94846204554804
And it is exactly because he is a bold fellow that he is the more to be feared	70.80503770257141
I must have said the duke a proof of his connection with Buckingham	513.6090391203677
A proof cried Milady I will have ten	63.02128412334571
Well then it becomes the simplest thing in the world get me that proof and I will send him to the Bastille	176.0668565503881
So far good monseigneur but afterwards	23486.64051753323
When once in the Bastille there is no afterward said the cardinal in a low voice	47.43895256950106
Ah pardieu continued he if it were as easy for me to get rid of my enemy as it is easy to get rid of yours and if it were against such people you require impunity	87.45137464123577
Monseigneur replied Milady a fair exchange	79950.93059039814
Life for life man for man give me one I will give you the other	60.29404491435372
I do nt know what you mean nor do I even desire to know what you mean replied the cardinal but I wish to please you and see nothing out of the way in giving you what you demand with respect to so infamous a creaturethe more so as you tell me this DArtagnan is a libertine a duelist and a traitor	161.69514270869496
An infamous scoundrel monseigneur a scoundrel	16656.87284406958
Give me paper a quill and some ink then said the cardinal	147.1696025297804
There was a moment of silence which proved that the cardinal was employed in seeking the terms in which he should write the note or else in writing it	159.38412846654555
Athos who had not lost a word of the conversation took his two companions by the hand and led them to the other end of the room	32.61580961135021
Well said Porthos what do you want and why do you not let us listen to the end of the conversation	20.64257096077051
Hush said Athos speaking in a low voice	3.185544330444917
We have heard all it was necessary we should hear besides I do nt prevent you from listening but I must be gone	146.36381736637668
You must be gone said Porthos and if the cardinal asks for you what answer can we make	288.8604860521001
You will not wait till he asks you will speak first and tell him that I am gone on the lookout because certain expressions of our host have given me reason to think the road is not safe	194.070071772425
I will say two words about it to the cardinals esquire likewise	708.495322891275
The rest concerns myself do nt be uneasy about that	68.53914047572583
Be easy on that head replied Athos you know I am cool enough	274.77722745716375
Porthos and Aramis resumed their places by the stovepipe	267.9588104934114
As to Athos he went out without any mystery took his horse which was tied with those of his friends to the fastenings of the shutters in four words convinced the attendant of the necessity of a vanguard for their return carefully examined the priming of his pistols drew his sword and took like a forlorn hope the road to the camp	214.2493924689791
As Athos had foreseen it was not long before the cardinal came down	125.16504246359466
He opened the door of the room in which the Musketeers were and found Porthos playing an earnest game of dice with Aramis	464.59077983951954
He cast a rapid glance around the room and perceived that one of his men was missing	100.93085242214848
What has become of Monseigneur Athos asked he	736.4082895223639
Monseigneur replied Porthos he has gone as a scout on account of some words of our host which made him believe the road was not safe	178.305637644152
And you what have you done Monsieur Porthos	1550.6165272123956
I have won five pistoles of Aramis	1948.7908924809694
Well now will you return with me	18.93823193549986
We are at your Eminences orders	15302.299649323426
To horse then gentlemen for it is getting late	151.31622273870167
The attendant was at the door holding the cardinals horse by the bridle	130.49226291642225
At a short distance a group of two men and three horses appeared in the shade	75.14082315464691
These were the two men who were to conduct Milady to Fort La Pointe and superintend her embarkation	2094.6875818457856
The attendant confirmed to the cardinal what the two Musketeers had already said with respect to Athos	533.5201654591882
The cardinal made an approving gesture and retraced his route with the same precautions he had used in coming	183.84470278448174
Let us leave him to follow the road to the camp protected by his esquire and the two Musketeers and return to Athos	291.37676883234326
For a hundred paces he maintained the speed at which he started but when out of sight he turned his horse to the right made a circuit and came back within twenty paces of a high hedge to watch the passage of the little troop	210.600092605909
Having recognized the laced hats of his companions and the golden fringe of the cardinals cloak he waited till the horsemen had turned the angle of the road and having lost sight of them he returned at a gallop to the inn which was opened to him without hesitation	99.6532514469822
My officer said Athos has forgotten to give a piece of very important information to the lady and has sent me back to repair his forgetfulness	160.9940182010191
Go up said the host she is still in her chamber	191.90128413473104
Athos availed himself of the permission ascended the stairs with his lightest step gained the landing and through the open door perceived Milady putting on her hat	560.0367212922366
He entered the chamber and closed the door behind him	18.519037063162113
At the noise he made in pushing the bolt Milady turned round	1626.126910266375
Athos was standing before the door enveloped in his cloak with his hat pulled down over his eyes	49.04235479816164
On seeing this figure mute and immovable as a statue Milady was frightened	534.8127538620234
Who are you and what do you want cried she	26.278646614461007
Humph murmured Athos it is certainly she	1373.6449927841813
And letting fall his cloak and raising his hat he advanced toward Milady	183.0040556703193
Do you know me madame said he	9.285724797588967
Milady made one step forward and then drew back as if she had seen a serpent	48.03379096332933
So far well said Athos I perceive you know me	62.257953067691126
The Comte de la Fre murmured Milady becoming exceedingly pale and drawing back till the wall prevented her from going any farther	1136.3226624960898
Yes Milady replied Athos the Comte de la Fre in person who comes expressly from the other world to have the pleasure of paying you a visit	108.74214296234577
Sit down madame and let us talk as the cardinal said	85.92513801711615
Milady under the influence of inexpressible terror sat down without uttering a word	304.4474727489068
You certainly are a demon sent upon the earth said Athos	240.04227006820224
Your power is great I know but you also know that with the help of God men have often conquered the most terrible demons	259.99933787464
You have once before thrown yourself in my path	95.28494576729463
I thought I had crushed you madame but either I was deceived or hell has resuscitated you	400.99912612546325
Milady at these words which recalled frightful remembrances hung down her head with a suppressed groan	555.1544586005656
Yes hell has resuscitated you continued Athos	9555.923618286019
Hell has made you rich hell has given you another name hell has almost made you another face but it has neither effaced the stains from your soul nor the brand from your body	470.04338064082333
Milady arose as if moved by a powerful spring and her eyes flashed lightning	186.05296097963915
You believed me to be dead did you not as I believed you to be And the name of Athos as well concealed the Comte de la Fre as the name Milady Clarik concealed Anne de Breuil	380.523756135703
Was it not so you were called when your honored brother married us Our position is truly a strange one continued Athos laughing	1295.474180268096
We have only lived up to the present time because we believed each other dead and because a remembrance is less oppressive than a living creature though a remembrance is sometimes devouring	459.25457714229924
But said Milady in a hollow faint voice what brings you back to me and what do you want with me	117.01842881040672
I wish to tell you that though remaining invisible to your eyes I have not lost sight of you	87.60211358840108
You know what I have done	12.326223712259907
I can relate to you day by day your actions from your entrance to the service of the cardinal to this evening	201.78259097185463
A smile of incredulity passed over the pale lips of Milady	97.2219283868462
Listen It was you who cut off the two diamond studs from the shoulder of the Duke of Buckingham it was you who had Madame Bonacieux carried off it was you who in love with De Wardes and thinking to pass the night with him opened the door to Monsieur dArtagnan it was you who believing that De Wardes had deceived you wished to have him killed by his rival it was you who when this rival had discovered your infamous secret wished to have him killed in his turn by two assassins whom you sent in pursuit of him it was you who finding the balls had missed their mark sent poisoned wine with a forged letter to make your victim believe that the wine came from his friends	263.7339590585431
In short it was you who have but now in this chamber seated in this chair I now fill made an engagement with Cardinal Richelieu to cause the Duke of Buckingham to be assassinated in exchange for the promise he has made you to allow you to assassinate DArtagnan	210.27905481147002
You must be Satan cried she	168.21119428908304
Perhaps said Athos But at all events listen well to this	157.24032044556307
Assassinate the Duke of Buckingham or cause him to be assassinatedI care very little about that I do nt know him	214.28131643374866
But do not touch with the tip of your finger a single hair of DArtagnan who is a faithful friend whom I love and defend or I swear to you by the head of my father the crime which you shall have endeavored to commit or shall have committed shall be the last	106.62745584989123
Monsieur dArtagnan has cruelly insulted me said Milady in a hollow tone Monsieur dArtagnan shall die	406.79037193618944
Indeed Is it possible to insult you madame said Athos laughing he has insulted you and he shall die	165.13944745982116
He shall die replied Milady she first and he afterward	859.5715838631161
Athos was seized with a kind of vertigo	284.7047463426363
The sight of this creature who had nothing of the woman about her recalled awful remembrances	497.9391835535327
He thought how one day in a less dangerous situation than the one in which he was now placed he had already endeavored to sacrifice her to his honor	99.4168588680711
His desire for blood returned burning his brain and pervading his frame like a raging fever he arose in his turn reached his hand to his belt drew forth a pistol and cocked it	158.25347263876688
Milady pale as a corpse endeavored to cry out but her swollen tongue could utter no more than a hoarse sound which had nothing human in it and resembled the rattle of a wild beast	252.78958419719683
Motionless against the dark tapestry with her hair in disorder she appeared like a horrid image of terror	254.54707145958722
Athos slowly raised his pistol stretched out his arm so that the weapon almost touched Miladys forehead and then in a voice the more terrible from having the supreme calmness of a fixed resolution Madame said he you will this instant deliver to me the paper the cardinal signed or upon my soul I will blow your brains out	249.24490166878417
With another man Milady might have preserved some doubt but she knew Athos	292.7746653500063
You have one second to decide said he	303.63240308901396
Milady saw by the contraction of his countenance that the trigger was about to be pulled she reached her hand quickly to her bosom drew out a paper and held it toward Athos	136.5817641326932
Take it said she and be accursed	10338.4024488364
Athos took the paper returned the pistol to his belt approached the lamp to be assured that it was the paper unfolded it and read	120.85400094805934
It is by my order and for the good of the state that the bearer of this has done what he has done	85.04559503719429
And now said Athos resuming his cloak and putting on his hat now that I have drawn your teeth viper bite if you can	265.76219658943023
And he left the chamber without once looking behind him	149.58045174156211
At the door he found the two men and the spare horse which they held	152.46800126290958
Gentlemen said he Monseigneurs order is you know to conduct that woman without losing time to Fort La Pointe and never to leave her till she is on board	376.69824139817416
As these words agreed wholly with the order they had received they bowed their heads in sign of assent	207.06526958578326
With regard to Athos he leaped lightly into the saddle and set out at full gallop only instead of following the road he went across the fields urging his horse to the utmost and stopping occasionally to listen	198.6711823419729
In one of those halts he heard the steps of several horses on the road	65.2199520384831
He had no doubt it was the cardinal and his escort	123.8670091126033
He immediately made a new point in advance rubbed his horse down with some heath and leaves of trees and placed himself across the road about two hundred paces from the camp	228.36942943862655
Who goes there cried he as soon as he perceived the horsemen	63.917280208971015
That is our brave Musketeer I think said the cardinal	138.2096959946889
Yes monseigneur said Porthos it is he	7.899387197512605
Monsieur Athos said Richelieu receive my thanks for the good guard you have kept	170.87441153988973
Gentlemen we are arrived take the gate on the left	57.22545942566078
The watchword is King and R	155963.07706771846
Saying these words the cardinal saluted the three friends with an inclination of his head and took the right hand followed by his attendantfor that night he himself slept in the camp	172.08667294011667
Well said Porthos and Aramis together as soon as the cardinal was out of hearing well he signed the paper she required	193.0690995510412
I know it said Athos coolly since here it is	889.6604408785822
And the three friends did not exchange another word till they reached their quarters except to give the watchword to the sentinels	257.60494463086894
Only they sent Mousqueton to tell Planchet that his master was requested the instant that he left the trenches to come to the quarters of the Musketeers	231.00755611075485
Milady as Athos had foreseen on finding the two men that awaited her made no difficulty in following them	254.66904238005873
She had had for an instant an inclination to be reconducted to the cardinal and relate everything to him but a revelation on her part would bring about a revelation on the part of Athos	199.67785745823335
She might say that Athos had hanged her but then Athos would tell that she was branded	420.36813563408964
She thought it was best to preserve silence to discreetly set off to accomplish her difficult mission with her usual skill and then all things being accomplished to the satisfaction of the cardinal to come to him and claim her vengeance	299.05177179926335
In consequence after having traveled all night at seven oclock she was at the fort of the Point at eight oclock she had embarked and at nine the vessel which with letters of marque from the cardinal was supposed to be sailing for Bayonne raised anchor and steered its course toward England	324.3162053615377
On arriving at the lodgings of his three friends DArtagnan found them assembled in the same chamber	201.25173325870767
Athos was meditating Porthos was twisting his mustache Aramis was saying his prayers in a charming little Book of Hours bound in blue velvet	947.5527197349796
I hope what you have to tell me is worth the trouble or else I warn you I will not pardon you for making me come here instead of getting a little rest after a night spent in taking and dismantling a bastion	201.29683022223608
Ah why were you not there gentlemen It was warm work	2280.9652900440014
We were in a place where it was not very cold replied Porthos giving his mustache a twist which was peculiar to him	156.3361691101684
Oh oh said DArtagnan comprehending the slight frown of the Musketeer	463.0491011996276
It appears there is something fresh aboard	23466.17711163996
Aramis said Athos you went to breakfast the day before yesterday at the inn of the Parpaillot I believe	54.31867365103383
For my part I ate but little	124.24129108869622
The day before yesterday was a fish day and they had nothing but meat	648.6571989121472
What said Athos no fish at a seaport	839.4876302025663
They say said Aramis resuming his pious reading that the dyke which the cardinal is making drives them all out into the open sea	629.5275770305955
But that is not quite what I mean to ask you Aramis replied Athos	316.92609927412235
I want to know if you were left alone and nobody interrupted you	340.10869804755544
Why I think there were not many intruders	2787.8808733609394
Yes Athos I know what you mean we shall do very well at the Parpaillot	130.68466199758927
Let us go to the Parpaillot then for here the walls are like sheets of paper	504.3297028288288
DArtagnan who was accustomed to his friends manner of acting and who perceived immediately by a word a gesture or a sign from him that the circumstances were serious took Athoss arm and went out without saying anything	238.82346382042635
On their way they met Grimaud	91063.9463158159
Athos made him a sign to come with them	97.49904347509653
Grimaud according to custom obeyed in silence the poor lad had nearly come to the pass of forgetting how to speak	333.64505038554626
They arrived at the drinking room of the Parpaillot	365.81290739463225
It was seven oclock in the morning and daylight began to appear	61.0129197259164
The three friends ordered breakfast and went into a room in which the host said they would not be disturbed	61.30702403376185
Unfortunately the hour was badly chosen for a private conference	746.7568511315785
The morning drum had just been beaten everyone shook off the drowsiness of night and to dispel the humid morning air came to take a drop at the inn	536.8439779962682
Dragoons Swiss Guardsmen Musketeers lighthorsemen succeeded one another with a rapidity which might answer the purpose of the host very well but agreed badly with the views of the four friends	209.09204073857072
Thus they applied very curtly to the salutations healths and jokes of their companions	827.7701419033755
I see how it will be said Athos we shall get into some pretty quarrel or other and we have no need of one just now	137.150851985644
DArtagnan tell us what sort of a night you have had and we will describe ours afterward	447.22198730189393
Ah yes said a lighthorseman with a glass of brandy in his hand which he sipped slowly	76.93476838484435
I hear you gentlemen of the Guards have been in the trenches tonight and that you did not get much the best of the Rochellais	199.4905142126437
DArtagnan looked at Athos to know if he ought to reply to this intruder who thus mixed unasked in their conversation	327.4418742878973
Well said Athos do nt you hear Monsieur de Busigny who does you the honor to ask you a question Relate what has passed during the night since these gentlemen desire to know it	150.28831201011153
Have you not taken a bastion said a Swiss who was drinking rum out of a beer glass	1057.3257383956563
Yes monsieur said DArtagnan bowing we have had that honor	161.2206461995246
We even have as you may have heard introduced a barrel of powder under one of the angles which in blowing up made a very pretty breach	384.0162366399369
Without reckoning that as the bastion was not built yesterday all the rest of the building was badly shaken	367.50337714262383
And what bastion is it asked a dragoon with his saber run through a goose which he was taking to be cooked	406.668755451734
Gervais replied DArtagnan from behind which the Rochellais annoyed our workmen	3053.496863751333
We lost five men and the Rochellais eight or ten	518.601580889014
Balzempleu said the Swiss who notwithstanding the admirable collection of oaths possessed by the German language had acquired a habit of swearing in French	581.5277073575431
But it is probable said the lighthorseman that they will send pioneers this morning to repair the bastion	654.2330754786319
Yes that s probable said DArtagnan	6366.166887093517
Ah wooi a vager cried the Swiss	311.6089908633971
What is it said the lighthorseman	417162.75633746793
Stop a bit said the dragoon placing his saber like a spit upon the two large iron dogs which held the firebrands in the chimney stop a bit I am in it	428.974536342136
You cursed host a dripping pan immediately that I may not lose a drop of the fat of this estimable bird	408.2607681591362
You was right said the Swiss goose grease is kood with basdry	24210.27036344366
Now for the wager We listen Monsieur Athos	17141.59843753944
Yes the wager said the lighthorseman	425331.73434052634
Well Monsieur de Busigny I will bet you said Athos that my three companions Messieurs Porthos Aramis and DArtagnan and myself will go and breakfast in the bastion St	705.1293733050118
Gervais and we will remain there an hour by the watch whatever the enemy may do to dislodge us	381.04679608728117
Porthos and Aramis looked at each other they began to comprehend	45.154126484020146
But said DArtagnan in the ear of Athos you are going to get us all killed without mercy	261.3324613595664
We are much more likely to be killed said Athos if we do not go	58.057920834947346
My faith gentlemen said Porthos turning round upon his chair and twisting his mustache that s a fair bet I hope	322.1784895520393
de Busigny so let us fix the stake	4525.205373445337
You are four gentlemen said Athos and we are four an unlimited dinner for eight	372.1748419239617
That shoots me said the Swiss	67728.11653214558
The fourth auditor who during all this conversation had played a mute part made a sign of the head in proof that he acquiesced in the proposition	256.55976916893604
The breakfast for these gentlemen is ready said the host	126.36421218369955
Athos called Grimaud pointed to a large basket which lay in a corner and made a sign to him to wrap the viands up in the napkins	137.02931938497127
Grimaud understood that it was to be a breakfast on the grass took the basket packed up the viands added the bottles and then took the basket on his arm	218.20201844165695
But where are you going to eat my breakfast asked the host	99.58011904413256
What matter if you are paid for it said Athos and he threw two pistoles majestically on the table	174.3967142750505
Shall I give you the change my officer said the host	259.0211503900246
No only add two bottles of champagne and the difference will be for the napkins	225.3920600345565
The host had not quite so good a bargain as he at first hoped for but he made amends by slipping in two bottles of Anjou wine instead of two bottles of champagne	421.8859364113898
Monsieur de Busigny said Athos will you be so kind as to set your watch with mine or permit me to regulate mine by yours	269.6395818511506
Which you please monsieur said the lighthorseman drawing from his fob a very handsome watch studded with diamonds half past seven	855.9547212871719
Thirtyfive minutes after seven said Athos by which you perceive I am five minutes faster than you	282.67417173348355
And bowing to all the astonished persons present the young men took the road to the bastion St	238.24375802834572
Gervais followed by Grimaud who carried the basket ignorant of where he was going but in the passive obedience which Athos had taught him not even thinking of asking	360.2112290252248
As long as they were within the circle of the camp the four friends did not exchange one word besides they were followed by the curious who hearing of the wager were anxious to know how they would come out of it	140.9315036391261
But when once they passed the line of circumvallation and found themselves in the open plain DArtagnan who was completely ignorant of what was going forward thought it was time to demand an explanation	140.1249644353339
And now my dear Athos said he do me the kindness to tell me where we are going	44.19756901544004
Why you see plainly enough we are going to the bastion	106.86626879920809
But what are we going to do there	28.69677026573192
You know well that we go to breakfast there	265.7310698454576
But why did we not breakfast at the Parpaillot	705.7633256310685
Because we have very important matters to communicate to one another and it was impossible to talk five minutes in that inn without being annoyed by all those importunate fellows who keep coming in saluting you and addressing you	295.17201758327064
Here at least said Athos pointing to the bastion they will not come and disturb us	113.55569009576264
It appears to me said DArtagnan with that prudence which allied itself in him so naturally with excessive bravery that we could have found some retired place on the downs or the seashore	435.32545364116004
Where we should have been seen all four conferring together so that at the end of a quarter of an hour the cardinal would have been informed by his spies that we were holding a council	95.56084090418936
Yes said Aramis Athos is right Animadvertuntur in desertis	10821.026731821608
A desert would not have been amiss said Porthos but it behooved us to find it	372.8192442480924
There is no desert where a bird can not pass over ones head where a fish can not leap out of the water where a rabbit can not come out of its burrow and I believe that bird fish and rabbit each becomes a spy of the cardinal	373.97664968602584
Better then pursue our enterprise from which besides we can not retreat without shame	346.3406075613437
We have made a wagera wager which could not have been foreseen and of which I defy anyone to divine the true cause	248.33256413400883
We are going in order to win it to remain an hour in the bastion	168.1044534864884
Either we shall be attacked or not	75.9311727805298
If we are not we shall have all the time to talk and nobody will hear usfor I guarantee the walls of the bastion have no ears if we are we will talk of our affairs just the same	304.9276940829297
Moreover in defending ourselves we shall cover ourselves with glory	396.906430520483
You see that everything is to our advantage	827.7347721174053
Yes said DArtagnan but we shall indubitably attract a ball	1937.657712600588
Well my dear replied Athos you know well that the balls most to be dreaded are not from the enemy	271.28434382853555
But for such an expedition we surely ought to have brought our muskets	373.8420567308642
Why should we load ourselves with a useless burden	259.73433034097985
I do nt find a good musket twelve cartridges and a powder flask very useless in the face of an enemy	690.5117170273519
Well replied Athos have you not heard what DArtagnan said	207.11690670501648
What did he say demanded Porthos	9828.155105362282
DArtagnan said that in the attack of last night eight or ten Frenchmen were killed and as many Rochellais	493.06685955758746
The bodies were not plundered were they It appears the conquerors had something else to do	392.60970071841837
Well we shall find their muskets their cartridges and their flasks and instead of four musketoons and twelve balls we shall have fifteen guns and a hundred charges to fire	828.3548722973167
Oh Athos said Aramis truly you are a great man	38.30321182922317
Porthos nodded in sign of agreement	87559.22375808214
DArtagnan alone did not seem convinced	17359.168789211108
Grimaud no doubt shared the misgivings of the young man for seeing that they continued to advance toward the bastionsomething he had till then doubtedhe pulled his master by the skirt of his coat	239.73313167073337
Where are we going asked he by a gesture	79.20659171321675
But said Grimaud in the same silent dialect we shall leave our skins there	540.7933863878086
Athos raised his eyes and his finger toward heaven	87.27570261102441
Grimaud put his basket on the ground and sat down with a shake of the head	29.780822272001178
Athos took a pistol from his belt looked to see if it was properly primed cocked it and placed the muzzle close to Grimauds ear	599.128237844896
Grimaud was on his legs again as if by a spring	73.16838231951787
Athos then made him a sign to take up his basket and to walk on first	191.97512815783904
All that Grimaud gained by this momentary pantomime was to pass from the rear guard to the vanguard	530.4185024566651
Arrived at the bastion the four friends turned round	189.31251030457085
More than three hundred soldiers of all kinds were assembled at the gate of the camp and in a separate group might be distinguished M	236.47351656870887
de Busigny the dragoon the Swiss and the fourth bettor	855.5589305691918
Athos took off his hat placed it on the end of his sword and waved it in the air	55.250465173073415
All the spectators returned him his salute accompanying this courtesy with a loud hurrah which was audible to the four after which all four disappeared in the bastion whither Grimaud had preceded them	637.9292034841958
As Athos had foreseen the bastion was only occupied by a dozen corpses French and Rochellais	1147.7761085238444
Gentlemen said Athos who had assumed the command of the expedition while Grimaud spreads the table let us begin by collecting the guns and cartridges together	446.6430832311129
We can talk while performing that necessary task	2996.706258290634
These gentlemen added he pointing to the bodies can not hear us	132.84475238768135
But we could throw them into the ditch said Porthos after having assured ourselves they have nothing in their pockets	345.3467951543962
Yes said Athos that s Grimauds business	20923.439697643797
Well then cried DArtagnan pray let Grimaud search them and throw them over the walls	402.83537504904047
Heaven forfend said Athos they may serve us	191.85376045379195
These bodies serve us said Porthos	1934.6824407701288
Judge not rashly say the gospel and the cardinal replied Athos	1676.9256509758243
That s quite as many as we shall want	71.37651921017563
The four Musketeers went to work and as they were loading the last musket Grimaud announced that the breakfast was ready	277.5916963406991
Athos replied always by gestures that that was well and indicated to Grimaud by pointing to a turret that resembled a pepper caster that he was to stand as sentinel	629.070531652966
Only to alleviate the tediousness of the duty Athos allowed him to take a loaf two cutlets and a bottle of wine	176.560090419933
And now to table said Athos	9512.58394391415
The four friends seated themselves on the ground with their legs crossed like Turks or even tailors	284.11968773254824
And now said DArtagnan as there is no longer any fear of being overheard I hope you are going to let me into your secret	59.07553408894387
I hope at the same time to procure you amusement and glory gentlemen said Athos	517.5561728578799
I have induced you to take a charming promenade here is a delicious breakfast and yonder are five hundred persons as you may see through the loopholes taking us for heroes or madmentwo classes of imbeciles greatly resembling each other	653.5793857922863
The secret is said Athos that I saw Milady last night	876.2010951295928
DArtagnan was lifting a glass to his lips but at the name of Milady his hand trembled so that he was obliged to put the glass on the ground again for fear of spilling the contents	87.42202662258813
You forget my dear you forget that these gentlemen are not initiated into my family affairs like yourself	198.49792670711378
Within two leagues of this place at the inn of the Red Dovecot	202.32931163147546
In that case I am lost said DArtagnan	516.3398314137277
Not so bad yet replied Athos for by this time she must have quit the shores of France	156.55068195262484
But after all asked Porthos who is Milady	925.1485380392157
A charming woman said Athos sipping a glass of sparkling wine	571.147237888367
Villainous host cried he he has given us Anjou wine instead of champagne and fancies we know no better Yes continued he a charming woman who entertained kind views toward our friend DArtagnan who on his part has given her some offense for which she tried to revenge herself a month ago by having him killed by two musket shots a week ago by trying to poison him and yesterday by demanding his head of the cardinal	465.0249456669668
What by demanding my head of the cardinal cried DArtagnan pale with terror	245.33340790510817
Yes that is true as the Gospel said Porthos I heard her with my own ears	198.20658346216948
Then said DArtagnan letting his arm fall with discouragement it is useless to struggle longer	577.9991778961019
I may as well blow my brains out and all will be over	71.19840491969957
That s the last folly to be committed said Athos seeing it is the only one for which there is no remedy	99.43326151656181
But I can never escape said DArtagnan with such enemies	281.4193002540071
First my stranger of Meung then De Wardes to whom I have given three sword wounds next Milady whose secret I have discovered finally the cardinal whose vengeance I have balked	1049.1409761236805
Well said Athos that only makes four and we are fourone for one	479.49346576586663
Pardieu if we may believe the signs Grimaud is making we are about to have to do with a very different number of people	189.350304468158
What is it Grimaud Considering the gravity of the occasion I permit you to speak my friend but be laconic I beg	185.06646390172992
Good We have just time to finish this fowl and to drink one glass of wine to your health DArtagnan	175.08579973750142
To your health repeated Porthos and Aramis	104.82682010132915
Well then to my health although I am very much afraid that your good wishes will not be of great service to me	115.33834302222257
Bah said Athos God is great as say the followers of Mohammed and the future is in his hands	299.42655307534943
Then swallowing the contents of his glass which he put down close to him Athos arose carelessly took the musket next to him and drew near to one of the loopholes	205.5009334514323
Porthos Aramis and DArtagnan followed his example	175.69617880791574
As to Grimaud he received orders to place himself behind the four friends in order to reload their weapons	280.6758584161136
Pardieu said Athos it was hardly worth while to distribute ourselves for twenty fellows armed with pickaxes mattocks and shovels	2090.3673312568794
Grimaud had only to make them a sign to go away and I am convinced they would have left us in peace	81.93486946238411
I doubt that replied DArtagnan for they are advancing very resolutely	709.0508841266504
Besides in addition to the pioneers there are four soldiers and a brigadier armed with muskets	1004.7710020173735
That s because they do nt see us said Athos	248.71840999665645
My faith said Aramis I must confess I feel a great repugnance to fire on these poor devils of civilians	388.7428731361857
He is a bad priest said Porthos who has pity for heretics	388.4735941398502
In truth said Athos Aramis is right	141.710484490748
What the devil are you going to do cried DArtagnan you will be shot	49.37116213904279
But Athos heeded not his advice	1470.902671634288
Mounting on the breach with his musket in one hand and his hat in the other he said bowing courteously and addressing the soldiers and the pioneers who astonished at this apparition stopped fifty paces from the bastion Gentlemen a few friends and myself are about to breakfast in this bastion	245.91590595980523
Now you know nothing is more disagreeable than being disturbed when one is at breakfast	265.56004758363497
We request you then if you really have business here to wait till we have finished our repast or to come again a short time hence unless which would be far better you form the salutary resolution to quit the side of the rebels and come and drink with us to the health of the King of France	165.1108438033153
Take care Athos cried DArtagnan do nt you see they are aiming	92.11540895523054
Yes yes said Athos but they are only civiliansvery bad marksmen who will be sure not to hit me	331.80849463685206
In fact at the same instant four shots were fired and the balls were flattened against the wall around Athos but not one touched him	351.44850481530955
Four shots replied to them almost instantaneously but much better aimed than those of the aggressors three soldiers fell dead and one of the pioneers was wounded	830.1039697652673
Grimaud said Athos still on the breach another musket	7545.134311900315
On their part the three friends had reloaded their arms a second discharge followed the first	493.77628353500984
The brigadier and two pioneers fell dead the rest of the troop took to flight	452.21829779548574
Now gentlemen a sortie cried Athos	4767.015687984271
And the four friends rushed out of the fort gained the field of battle picked up the four muskets of the privates and the halfpike of the brigadier and convinced that the fugitives would not stop till they reached the city turned again toward the bastion bearing with them the trophies of their victory	213.0992119433097
Reload the muskets Grimaud said Athos and we gentlemen will go on with our breakfast and resume our conversation	263.0436916219221
I recollect you were saying said DArtagnan that after having demanded my head of the cardinal Milady had quit the shores of France	369.6754671234867
Whither goes she added he strongly interested in the route Milady followed	2793.692212146823
She goes into England said Athos	2309.6011621495236
With the view of assassinating or causing to be assassinated the Duke of Buckingham	294.5045701630344
DArtagnan uttered an exclamation of surprise and indignation	269.5576298801282
But this is infamous cried he	35.73167839559464
As to that said Athos I beg you to believe that I care very little about it	39.664442771430444
Now you have done Grimaud take our brigadiers halfpike tie a napkin to it and plant it on top of our bastion that these rebels of Rochellais may see that they have to deal with brave and loyal soldiers of the king	823.2115048860741
An instant afterward the white flag was floating over the heads of the four friends	135.2749069037189
A thunder of applause saluted its appearance half the camp was at the barrier	244.55322176221404
How replied DArtagnan you care little if she kills Buckingham or causes him to be killed But the duke is our friend	709.8023553397063
The duke is English the duke fights against us	4211.94326094089
Let her do what she likes with the duke I care no more about him than an empty bottle	287.80212227684854
And Athos threw fifteen paces from him an empty bottle from which he had poured the last drop into his glass	107.61684068509406
I will not abandon Buckingham thus	5251.464374550824
He gave us some very fine horses	1803.531720603351
And moreover very handsome saddles said Porthos who at the moment wore on his cloak the lace of his own	116.97342886854945
Besides said Aramis God desires the conversion and not the death of a sinner	301.3040663559825
Amen said Athos and we will return to that subject later if such be your pleasure but what for the moment engaged my attention most earnestly and I am sure you will understand me DArtagnan was the getting from this woman a kind of carte blanche which she had extorted from the cardinal and by means of which she could with impunity get rid of you and perhaps of us	189.67021279536064
But this creature must be a demon said Porthos holding out his plate to Aramis who was cutting up a fowl	280.95614667330796
And this carte blanche said DArtagnan this carte blanche does it remain in her hands	1199.344137406842
No it passed into mine I will not say without trouble for if I did I should tell a lie	110.17668322658385
My dear Athos I shall no longer count the number of times I am indebted to you for my life	71.23114736249921
Then it was to go to her that you left us said Aramis	92.91022782023022
And you have that letter of the cardinal said DArtagnan	197.01289174886114
Here it is said Athos and he took the invaluable paper from the pocket of his uniform	82.5027125626237
DArtagnan unfolded it with one hand whose trembling he did not even attempt to conceal to read	121.51417098616889
It is by my order and for the good of the state that the bearer of this has done what he has done	85.04559503719429
In fact said Aramis it is an absolution according to rule	939.9404039172509
That paper must be torn to pieces said DArtagnan who fancied he read in it his sentence of death	214.95500980149635
On the contrary said Athos it must be preserved carefully	312.12008919868197
I would not give up this paper if covered with as many gold pieces	291.85277432428575
And what will she do now asked the young man	17.741075094576093
Why replied Athos carelessly she is probably going to write to the cardinal that a damned Musketeer named Athos has taken her safeconduct from her by force she will advise him in the same letter to get rid of his two friends Aramis and Porthos at the same time	181.76273848405518
The cardinal will remember that these are the same men who have often crossed his path and then some fine morning he will arrest DArtagnan and for fear he should feel lonely he will send us to keep him company in the Bastille	177.96862123155054
Go to It appears to me you make dull jokes my dear said Porthos	654.7074559246166
I do not jest said Athos	7004.760873585149
Do you know said Porthos that to twist that damned Miladys neck would be a smaller sin than to twist those of these poor devils of Huguenots who have committed no other crime than singing in French the psalms we sing in Latin	914.5271186436349
What says the abb asked Athos quietly	6104.483347429446
I say I am entirely of Porthoss opinion replied Aramis	2275.3394501548023
Fortunately she is far off said Porthos for I confess she would worry me if she were here	282.8601145632015
She worries me in England as well as in France said Athos	51.783255027867185
She worries me everywhere said DArtagnan	1376.4230542579871
But when you held her in your power why did you not drown her strangle her hang her said Porthos	348.08029183838386
It is only the dead who do not return	67.74492963788539
You think so Porthos replied the Musketeer with a sad smile which DArtagnan alone understood	167.46113150688893
I have an idea said DArtagnan	3576.9858094814786
What is it said the Musketeers	460622.3311179376
The young men sprang up and seized their muskets	267.53018073745835
This time a small troop advanced consisting of from twenty to twentyfive men but they were not pioneers they were soldiers of the garrison	305.9009287691772
Shall we return to the camp said Porthos	2834.058201516802
I do nt think the sides are equal	2630.3634088725885
Impossible for three reasons replied Athos	4250.66914563389
The first that we have not finished breakfast the second that we still have some very important things to say and the third that it yet wants ten minutes before the lapse of the hour	238.2965273885061
Well then said Aramis we must form a plan of battle	218.16344042058276
That s very simple replied Athos	3965.196713169822
As soon as the enemy are within musket shot we must fire upon them	1338.6915708035629
If they continue to advance we must fire again	495.6049488247384
We must fire as long as we have loaded guns	318.5544062644728
If those who remain of the troop persist in coming to the assault we will allow the besiegers to get as far as the ditch and then we will push down upon their heads that strip of wall which keeps its perpendicular by a miracle	346.60438627992903
Decidedly Athos you were born to be a general and the cardinal who fancies himself a great soldier is nothing beside you	196.45927984451149
Gentlemen said Athos no divided attention I beg let each one pick out his man	1066.135672214483
The four muskets made but one report but four men fell	904.5141976115922
The drum immediately beat and the little troop advanced at charging pace	1819.5594053263592
Then the shots were repeated without regularity but always aimed with the same accuracy	720.3205711485153
Nevertheless as if they had been aware of the numerical weakness of the friends the Rochellais continued to advance in quick time	401.6947945344547
With every three shots at least two men fell but the march of those who remained was not slackened	317.50988859852305
Arrived at the foot of the bastion there were still more than a dozen of the enemy	89.66304301397771
A last discharge welcomed them but did not stop them they jumped into the ditch and prepared to scale the breach	256.01543720078223
Now my friends said Athos finish them at a blow	1197.6559581257338
To the wall to the wall	45.08067037631686
And the four friends seconded by Grimaud pushed with the barrels of their muskets an enormous sheet of the wall which bent as if pushed by the wind and detaching itself from its base fell with a horrible crash into the ditch	281.4904713785542
Then a fearful crash was heard a cloud of dust mounted toward the skyand all was over	227.8681618368336
Can we have destroyed them all from the first to the last said Athos	120.78003141590288
My faith it appears so said DArtagnan	548.3806390529004
No cried Porthos there go three or four limping away	422.2440996195996
In fact three or four of these unfortunate men covered with dirt and blood fled along the hollow way and at length regained the city	390.1353994338637
These were all who were left of the little troop	239.65995913302035
Gentlemen said he we have been here an hour and our wager is won but we will be fair players	371.31562266176115
Besides DArtagnan has not told us his idea yet	227.36482181441
And the Musketeer with his usual coolness reseated himself before the remains of the breakfast	241.02960650945076
Yes you said you had an idea said Athos	259.5041469826614
Well I will go to England a second time I will go and find Buckingham	198.47002659018383
You shall not do that DArtagnan said Athos coolly	7584.263576924663
And why not Have I not been there once	264.5706939535212
Yes but at that period we were not at war	156.33324099769231
At that period Buckingham was an ally and not an enemy	193.5223594406432
What you would now do amounts to treason	15081.076599756767
DArtagnan perceived the force of this reasoning and was silent	223.22674686356427
But said Porthos I think I have an idea in my turn	36.207760952944575
Silence for Monsieur Porthoss idea said Aramis	501.9513671294935
I will ask leave of absence of Monsieur de Trville on some pretext or other which you must invent I am not very clever at pretexts	450.3927647519599
Milady does not know me I will get access to her without her suspecting me and when I catch my beauty I will strangle her	223.36576585527084
Well replied Athos I am not far from approving the idea of Monsieur Porthos	297.317237848816
Kill a woman No listen to me I have the true idea	54.04709799075273
Let us see your idea Aramis said Athos who felt much deference for the young Musketeer	785.578538512398
Ah my faith yes said Porthos and DArtagnan at the same time we are coming nearer to it now	141.64173948644918
Inform the queen said Athos and how Have we relations with the court Could we send anyone to Paris without its being known in the camp From here to Paris it is a hundred and forty leagues before our letter was at Angers we should be in a dungeon	299.6910792161875
As to remitting a letter with safety to her Majesty said Aramis coloring I will take that upon myself	519.7178078371144
I know a clever person at Tours	7774.5085642379345
Aramis stopped on seeing Athos smile	46965.957351407866
Well do you not adopt this means Athos said DArtagnan	449.7740673896372
I do not reject it altogether said Athos but I wish to remind Aramis that he can not quit the camp and that nobody but one of ourselves is trustworthy that two hours after the messenger has set out all the Capuchins all the police all the black caps of the cardinal will know your letter by heart and you and your clever person will be arrested	254.14330556030302
Without reckoning objected Porthos that the queen would save Monsieur de Buckingham but would take no heed of us	314.6977688756612
Gentlemen said DArtagnan what Porthos says is full of sense	274.69595710671376
Ah ah but what s going on in the city yonder said Athos	436.3964215529736
They are beating the general alarm	3529.7943963268917
The four friends listened and the sound of the drum plainly reached them	309.01318622236516
You see they are going to send a whole regiment against us said Athos	202.41590370389892
You do nt think of holding out against a whole regiment do you said Porthos	858.4122133454307
I feel myself quite in a humor for it and I would hold out before an army if we had taken the precaution to bring a dozen more bottles of wine	167.78766387021733
Upon my word the drum draws near said DArtagnan	2882.0186487102405
It is a quarter of an hours journey from here to the city consequently a quarter of an hours journey from the city to hither	185.5163453852931
That is more than time enough for us to devise a plan	374.0705451290831
If we go from this place we shall never find another so suitable	94.78365551973228
Ah stop I have it gentlemen the right idea has just occurred to me	156.4002941402018
Allow me to give Grimaud some indispensable orders	1669.5470419593587
Athos made a sign for his lackey to approach	339.84438221721416
Grimaud said Athos pointing to the bodies which lay under the wall of the bastion take those gentlemen set them up against the wall put their hats upon their heads and their guns in their hands	207.1916725050921
Oh the great man cried DArtagnan	8846.373080958254
And do you comprehend Grimaud said Aramis	182.38448869201915
Grimaud made a sign in the affirmative	19.951825519807525
That s all that is necessary said Athos now for my idea	306.0693034936918
I should like however to comprehend said Porthos	1604.8283997427363
Yes yes Athoss idea cried Aramis and DArtagnan at the same time	85.14495525796369
This Milady this woman this creature this demon has a brotherinlaw as I think you told me DArtagnan	323.23800758092733
Yes I know him very well and I also believe that he has not a very warm affection for his sisterinlaw	91.32272171438494
There is no harm in that	28.73254117235417
If he detested her it would be all the better replied Athos	90.09285491538839
In that case we are as well off as we wish	147.89671543053842
And yet said Porthos I would like to know what Grimaud is about	150.72791831151002
He returned to London at the first sound of war	79.10198410448487
Well there s just the man we want said Athos	226.7004778526542
It is he whom we must warn	414.9230575693961
We will have him informed that his sisterinlaw is on the point of having someone assassinated and beg him not to lose sight of her	93.8233685719
There is in London I hope some establishment like that of the Magdalens or of the Repentant Daughters	614.5718781576437
He must place his sister in one of these and we shall be in peace	45.14879388812308
Yes said DArtagnan till she comes out	212.38310901196778
Ah my faith said Athos you require too much DArtagnan	676.9835218104388
I have given you all I have and I beg leave to tell you that this is the bottom of my sack	65.80407120731275
But I think it would be still better said Aramis to inform the queen and Lord de Winter at the same time	103.33073792249805
Yes but who is to carry the letter to Tours and who to London	301.79677419317994
I answer for Bazin said Aramis	8239.02135662067
And I for Planchet said DArtagnan	5256.590249560275
Ay said Porthos if we can not leave the camp our lackeys may	366.059366355542
To be sure they may and this very day we will write the letters said Aramis	306.7349536412912
Give the lackeys money and they will start	258.2363799564023
We will give them money replied Athos	1320.750015271828
The four friends looked at one another and a cloud came over the brows which but lately had been so cheerful	203.7197118358157
Look out cried DArtagnan I see black points and red points moving yonder	8462.437057844618
Why did you talk of a regiment Athos It is a veritable army	867.5366738682764
My faith yes said Athos there they are	195.15729154090522
See the sneaks come without drum or trumpet	14255.372228020555
Ah ah have you finished Grimaud	200358.74452432783
Grimaud made a sign in the affirmative and pointed to a dozen bodies which he had set up in the most picturesque attitudes	143.29355159845534
Some carried arms others seemed to be taking aim and the remainder appeared merely to be sword in hand	526.6676205226388
Bravo said Athos that does honor to your imagination	271.968936756764
All very well said Porthos but I should like to understand	39.22506493430853
Let us decamp first and you will understand afterward	372.35259073056324
A moment gentlemen a moment give Grimaud time to clear away the breakfast	1727.4044658209705
Ah ah said Aramis the black points and the red points are visibly enlarging	3450.6098976243034
I am of DArtagnans opinion we have no time to lose in regaining our camp	154.65359967590555
My faith said Athos I have nothing to say against a retreat	74.31087501697276
We bet upon one hour and we have stayed an hour and a half	98.84218976284144
Nothing can be said let us be off gentlemen let us be off	94.64890000302668
Grimaud was already ahead with the basket and the dessert	513.7607932521271
The four friends followed ten paces behind him	19.349739348787924
What the devil shall we do now gentlemen cried Athos	1427.919352175939
Have you forgotten anything said Aramis	4910.140177526261
The white flag morbleu We must not leave a flag in the hands of the enemy even if that flag be but a napkin	137.641249983654
And Athos ran back to the bastion mounted the platform and bore off the flag but as the Rochellais had arrived within musket range they opened a terrible fire upon this man who appeared to expose himself for pleasures sake	434.65724937324705
But Athos might be said to bear a charmed life	630.446440151132
The balls passed and whistled all around him not one struck him	179.5061661289953
Athos waved his flag turning his back on the guards of the city and saluting those of the camp	90.2987771049097
On both sides loud cries aroseon the one side cries of anger on the other cries of enthusiasm	360.49493836160195
A second discharge followed the first and three balls by passing through it made the napkin really a flag	1049.269615092186
Cries were heard from the camp Come down come down	6098.200904848702
Athos came down his friends who anxiously awaited him saw him returned with joy	247.21323990749843
Come along Athos come along cried DArtagnan now we have found everything except money it would be stupid to be killed	267.84923685253943
But Athos continued to march majestically whatever remarks his companions made and they finding their remarks useless regulated their pace by his	3156.774170579536
Grimaud and his basket were far in advance out of the range of the balls	167.2581478608133
At the end of an instant they heard a furious fusillade	888.7225610310999
What s that asked Porthos what are they firing at now I hear no balls whistle and I see nobody	1290.6247626555967
They are firing at the corpses replied Athos	8281.137922434717
But the dead can not return their fire	682.5596879650941
Certainly not They will then fancy it is an ambuscade they will deliberate and by the time they have found out the pleasantry we shall be out of the range of their balls	220.09165741638458
That renders it useless to get a pleurisy by too much haste	1032.0673110687421
Oh I comprehend now said the astonished Porthos	1192.0334456162532
That s lucky said Athos shrugging his shoulders	22.308444623092836
On their part the French on seeing the four friends return at such a step uttered cries of enthusiasm	365.81951878365845
At length a fresh discharge was heard and this time the balls came rattling among the stones around the four friends and whistling sharply in their ears	282.6730718477999
The Rochellais had at last taken possession of the bastion	190.03028496985664
These Rochellais are bungling fellows said Athos how many have we killed of thema dozen	1214.3554166627391
How many did we crush under the wall	199.55587227050418
And in exchange for all that not even a scratch Ah but what is the matter with your hand DArtagnan It bleeds seemingly	797.294256935933
We have said that Athos loved DArtagnan like a child and this somber and inflexible personage felt the anxiety of a parent for the young man	267.60600351696394
Only grazed a little replied DArtagnan my fingers were caught between two stonesthat of the wall and that of my ringand the skin was broken	397.9523590837525
That comes of wearing diamonds my master said Athos disdainfully	1222.1385644968575
Ah to be sure cried Porthos there is a diamond	255.12712254363825
Why the devil then do we plague ourselves about money when there is a diamond	481.9497882292502
Well thought of Porthos this time you have an idea	156.4872607268085
Undoubtedly said Porthos drawing himself up at Athoss compliment as there is a diamond let us sell it	341.7154453239009
But said DArtagnan it is the queens diamond	1994.0926594794134
The stronger reason why it should be sold replied Athos	309.17379158370073
The queen saving Monsieur de Buckingham her lover nothing more just	3319.2680134339007
The queen saving us her friends nothing more moral	1146.3308288885214
What says Monsieur the Abb I do nt ask Porthos his opinion has been given	816.8096211955187
Why I think said Aramis blushing as usual that his ring not coming from a mistress and consequently not being a love token DArtagnan may sell it	644.9412337257174
My dear Aramis you speak like theology personified	83918.01772178557
To sell the diamond replied Aramis	16030.831189406457
Well then said DArtagnan gaily let us sell the diamond and say no more about it	96.80325289020055
The fusillade continued but the four friends were out of reach and the Rochellais only fired to appease their consciences	896.3400956166316
My faith it was time that idea came into Porthoss head	1629.595284029932
Here we are at the camp therefore gentlemen not a word more of this affair	339.516190157536
We are observed they are coming to meet us	73.33551580334485
We shall be carried in triumph	64920.72094978878
In fact as we have said the whole camp was in motion	251.82648628264783
More than two thousand persons had assisted as at a spectacle in this fortunate but wild undertaking of the four friendsan undertaking of which they were far from suspecting the real motive	709.3153791497477
Nothing was heard but cries of Live the Musketeers Live the Guards M	7789.347234730195
de Busigny was the first to come and shake Athos by the hand and acknowledge that the wager was lost	326.36144529198884
The dragoon and the Swiss followed him and all their comrades followed the dragoon and the Swiss	225.47882945842744
There was nothing but felicitations pressures of the hand and embraces there was no end to the inextinguishable laughter at the Rochellais	685.1437446843221
The tumult at length became so great that the cardinal fancied there must be some riot and sent La Houdinire his captain of the Guards to inquire what was going on	365.90428657388594
The affair was described to the messenger with all the effervescence of enthusiasm	154.9860668684993
Well asked the cardinal on seeing La Houdinire return	4236.683949046543
Well monseigneur replied the latter three Musketeers and a Guardsman laid a wager with Monsieur de Busigny that they would go and breakfast in the bastion St	647.9528936418452
Gervais and while breakfasting they held it for two hours against the enemy and have killed I do nt know how many Rochellais	139.4012343199303
Did you inquire the names of those three Musketeers	359.62377049580584
Still my three brave fellows murmured the cardinal	552.6632821224192
Positively these four men must be on my side	30.019370672189257
The same evening the cardinal spoke to M	85.96685111011858
de Trville of the exploit of the morning which was the talk of the whole camp	102.36381649395267
de Trville who had received the account of the adventure from the mouths of the heroes of it related it in all its details to his Eminence not forgetting the episode of the napkin	218.71288038457917
That s well Monsieur de Trville said the cardinal pray let that napkin be sent to me	457.27435922164153
I will have three fleurdelis embroidered on it in gold and will give it to your company as a standard	213.899227360538
de Trville that will be unjust to the Guardsmen	569.0466920256392
Monsieur dArtagnan is not with me he serves under Monsieur Dessessart	4315.5127851865445
Well then take him said the cardinal when four men are so much attached to one another it is only fair that they should serve in the same company	121.9377266530243
de Trville announced this good news to the three Musketeers and DArtagnan inviting all four to breakfast with him next morning	630.7869601315392
DArtagnan was beside himself with joy	204.94536180488532
We know that the dream of his life had been to become a Musketeer	95.22330167090284
The three friends were likewise greatly delighted	5801.377331803051
My faith said DArtagnan to Athos you had a triumphant idea As you said we have acquired glory and were enabled to carry on a conversation of the highest importance	355.64935198561807
Which we can resume now without anybody suspecting us for with the help of God we shall henceforth pass for cardinalists	885.0933273974249
That evening DArtagnan went to present his respects to M	163.14129267143787
Dessessart and inform him of his promotion	647.9242023835585
Dessessart who esteemed DArtagnan made him offers of help as this change would entail expenses for equipment	1866.2892983957242
DArtagnan refused but thinking the opportunity a good one he begged him to have the diamond he put into his hand valued as he wished to turn it into money	132.0384472573965
Dessessarts valet came to DArtagnans lodging and gave him a bag containing seven thousand livres	230.26703493722778
This was the price of the queens diamond	1728.457076928798
Athos had invented the phrase family affair	21033.912125037925
A family affair was not subject to the investigation of the cardinal a family affair concerned nobody	850.7637325977172
People might employ themselves in a family affair before all the world	97.34968391210359
Therefore Athos had invented the phrase family affair	23382.940594259297
Aramis had discovered the idea the lackeys	4455.583930879448
Porthos had discovered the means the diamond	299.7673711588519
DArtagnan alone had discovered nothinghe ordinarily the most inventive of the four but it must be also said that the very name of Milady paralyzed him	363.7947935536066
Ah no we were mistaken he had discovered a purchaser for his diamond	218.33298375720133
de Trvilles was as gay and cheerful as possible	556.8414370058924
DArtagnan already wore his uniformfor being nearly of the same size as Aramis and as Aramis was so liberally paid by the publisher who purchased his poem as to allow him to buy everything double he sold his friend a complete outfit	549.5968496121324
DArtagnan would have been at the height of his wishes if he had not constantly seen Milady like a dark cloud hovering in the horizon	196.7543443220959
After breakfast it was agreed that they should meet again in the evening at Athoss lodging and there finish their plans	319.25175442738396
DArtagnan passed the day in exhibiting his Musketeers uniform in every street of the camp	1053.976159693262
In the evening at the appointed hour the four friends met	105.97347374613096
There only remained three things to decidewhat they should write to Miladys brother what they should write to the clever person at Tours and which should be the lackeys to carry the letters	437.87113723599
Athos talked of the discretion of Grimaud who never spoke a word but when his master unlocked his mouth	211.57241591722354
Porthos boasted of the strength of Mousqueton who was big enough to thrash four men of ordinary size	435.3343978939225
Aramis confiding in the address of Bazin made a pompous eulogium on his candidate	1027.7004219019975
Finally DArtagnan had entire faith in the bravery of Planchet and reminded them of the manner in which he had conducted himself in the ticklish affair of Boulogne	142.96041705097994
These four virtues disputed the prize for a length of time and gave birth to magnificent speeches which we do not repeat here for fear they should be deemed too long	333.2469538548081
Unfortunately said Athos he whom we send must possess in himself alone the four qualities united	1662.397511666037
But where is such a lackey to be found	226.1925436341328
Not to be found cried Athos	13218.066254873074
I know it well so take Grimaud	37332.88498829536
Planchet is brave and shrewd they are two qualities out of the four	287.1697712588865
Gentlemen said Aramis the principal question is not to know which of our four lackeys is the most discreet the most strong the most clever or the most brave the principal thing is to know which loves money the best	365.9269022889472
What Aramis says is very sensible replied Athos we must speculate upon the faults of people and not upon their virtues	568.9815438513175
Monsieur Abb you are a great moralist	5668.28984412952
Doubtless said Aramis for we not only require to be well served in order to succeed but moreover not to fail for in case of failure heads are in question not for our lackeys	406.55912607854054
That s wisenot for the lackeys resumed Aramis but for the masterfor the masters we may say	1251.2229562523646
Are our lackeys sufficiently devoted to us to risk their lives for us No	87.75612421615529
I would almost answer for Planchet	143666.76573948647
Well my dear friend add to his natural devotedness a good sum of money and then instead of answering for him once answer for him twice	199.03065294712457
Why good God you will be deceived just the same said Athos who was an optimist when things were concerned and a pessimist when men were in question	518.6951224377482
They will promise everything for the sake of the money and on the road fear will prevent them from acting	158.3851776645483
Once taken they will be pressed when pressed they will confess everything	2553.133648175477
What the devil we are not children	341.14141112954223
To reach EnglandAthos lowered his voiceall France covered with spies and creatures of the cardinal must be crossed	930.701275788797
A passport for embarkation must be obtained and the party must be acquainted with English in order to ask the way to London	135.3739282562646
Really I think the thing very difficult	544.6735552794329
Not at all cried DArtagnan who was anxious the matter should be accomplished on the contrary I think it very easy	89.68026232935578
It would be no doubt parbleu if we write to Lord de Winter about affairs of vast importance of the horrors of the cardinal	604.499527394451
of intrigues and secrets of state continued DArtagnan complying with the recommendation	2530.4771129990054
There can be no doubt we would all be broken on the wheel but for Gods sake do not forget as you yourself said Athos that we only write to him concerning a family affair that we only write to him to entreat that as soon as Milady arrives in London he will put it out of her power to injure us	225.83112427086232
I will write to him then nearly in these terms	749.7828922258201
Let us see said Athos assuming in advance a critical look	1167.8538116493803
Ah yes Dear friend to an Englishman interrupted Athos well commenced Bravo DArtagnan Only with that word you would be quartered instead of being broken on the wheel	1045.761871808785
I will say then Monsieur quite short	4724.588587433284
You may even say My Lord replied Athos who stickled for propriety	5863.75332794042
My Lord do you remember the little goat pasture of the Luxembourg	893.5833837975601
Good the Luxembourg One might believe this is an allusion to the queenmother That s ingenious said Athos	756.6847544936413
Well then we will put simply My Lord do you remember a certain little enclosure where your life was spared	940.7126196344374
My dear DArtagnan you will never make anything but a very bad secretary	233.45935561808864
Where your life was spared For shame that s unworthy	6540.28603250443
A man of spirit is not to be reminded of such services	222.97586084111495
A benefit reproached is an offense committed	60549.1336936188
The devil said DArtagnan you are insupportable	1011.3092954464998
If the letter must be written under your censure my faith I renounce the task	1469.3034810094314
Handle the musket and the sword my dear fellow	160.3481514421536
You will come off splendidly at those two exercises but pass the pen over to Monsieur Abb	1001.3758823214699
Ay ay said Porthos pass the pen to Aramis who writes theses in Latin	1300.3549092107228
Well so be it said DArtagnan	4753.587036087757
Draw up this note for us Aramis but by our Holy Father the Pope cut it short for I shall prune you in my turn I warn you	486.44909833018596
I ask no better said Aramis with that ingenious air of confidence which every poet has in himself but let me be properly acquainted with the subject	305.8578448561639
I have heard here and there that this sisterinlaw was a hussy	697.3236790365133
I have obtained proof of it by listening to her conversation with the cardinal	157.45178808701053
But continued Aramis the details escape me	1626.739340539344
DArtagnan and Athos looked at each other for some time in silence	43.51009662657728
At length Athos after serious reflection and becoming more pale than usual made a sign of assent to DArtagnan who by it understood he was at liberty to speak	90.74148677356413
Well this is what you have to say said DArtagnan My Lord your sisterinlaw is an infamous woman who wished to have you killed that she might inherit your wealth but she could not marry your brother being already married in France and having been DArtagnan stopped as if seeking for the word and looked at Athos	196.80719151450668
Repudiated by her husband said Athos	3751.5350702449077
Because she had been branded continued DArtagnan	46403.87131908657
Impossible What do you saythat she wanted to have her brotherinlaw killed	437.93383934878847
And her husband found out that she had a fleurdelis on her shoulder cried Porthos	296.8159300764422
These three yeses had been pronounced by Athos each with a sadder intonation	2720.295636872847
And who has seen this fleurdelis inquired Aramis	34450.25453461143
Or rather to observe the chronological order I and DArtagnan replied Athos	4714.226515232196
And does the husband of this frightful creature still live said Aramis	433.94721876804806
Are you quite sure of it	9.524576842134698
There was a moment of cold silence during which everyone was affected according to his nature	247.445750504674
This time said Athos first breaking the silence DArtagnan has given us an excellent program and the letter must be written at once	299.88811245613647
The devil You are right Athos said Aramis and it is a rather difficult matter	321.13757048799164
The chancellor himself would be puzzled how to write such a letter and yet the chancellor draws up an official report very readily	805.8773574160515
Never mind Be silent I will write	87.60515404186397
Aramis accordingly took the quill reflected for a few moments wrote eight or ten lines in a charming little female hand and then with a voice soft and slow as if each word had been scrupulously weighed he read the following	279.7624144657101
My Lord The person who writes these few lines had the honor of crossing swords with you in the little enclosure of the Rue dEnfer	304.0121079090012
As you have several times since declared yourself the friend of that person he thinks it his duty to respond to that friendship by sending you important information	360.4964574863565
Twice you have nearly been the victim of a near relative whom you believe to be your heir because you are ignorant that before she contracted a marriage in England she was already married in France	179.03956266779244
But the third time which is the present you may succumb	545.469812407735
Your relative left La Rochelle for England during the night	323.0202887187319
Watch her arrival for she has great and terrible projects	393.57477763953347
If you require to know positively what she is capable of read her past history on her left shoulder	454.25507090387356
Well now that will do wonderfully well said Athos	7387.756796051695
My dear Aramis you have the pen of a secretary of state	330.7749932969525
Lord de Winter will now be upon his guard if the letter should reach him and even if it should fall into the hands of the cardinal we shall not be compromised	97.85925888456326
But as the lackey who goes may make us believe he has been to London and may stop at Chtellerault let us give him only half the sum promised him with the letter with an agreement that he shall have the other half in exchange for the reply	249.68165707959096
Have you the diamond continued Athos	18486.300672044712
I have what is still better	249.71563230780822
I have the price and DArtagnan threw the bag upon the table	187.54096036847392
At the sound of the gold Aramis raised his eyes and Porthos started	352.5692233894413
As to Athos he remained unmoved	33938.43505798571
How much in that little bag	50916.5388009056
Seven thousand livres in louis of twelve francs	203.79731707805408
That poor little diamond was worth seven thousand livres	150.5605749015368
It appears so said Athos since here they are	111.70598559587434
I do nt suppose that our friend DArtagnan has added any of his own to the amount	136.09002934638062
But gentlemen in all this said DArtagnan we do not think of the queen	67.47525858125454
Let us take some heed of the welfare of her dear Buckingham	256.45927824365003
That is the least we owe her	215.86471863834575
That s true said Athos but that concerns Aramis	1376.7062075847703
Well replied the latter blushing what must I say	136.20800145188522
Oh that s simple enough replied Athos	1568.3225064480803
Write a second letter for that clever personage who lives at Tours	1633.7111220757665
Aramis resumed his pen reflected a little and wrote the following lines which he immediately submitted to the approbation of his friends	124.9032006513931
This clever person is your relative then	2641.329369980651
Go on to your cousin then	101.03231019988203
MY DEAR COUSIN His Eminence the cardinal whom God preserve for the happiness of France and the confusion of the enemies of the kingdom is on the point of putting an end to the hectic rebellion of La Rochelle	170.75594089829528
It is probable that the succor of the English fleet will never even arrive in sight of the place	239.77363642725444
I will even venture to say that I am certain M	43.161908637595516
de Buckingham will be prevented from setting out by some great event	410.0631904412445
His Eminence is the most illustrious politician of times past of times present and probably of times to come	1133.4213634180278
He would extinguish the sun if the sun incommoded him	1154.260735915855
Give these happy tidings to your sister my dear cousin	160.17022469091873
I have dreamed that the unlucky Englishman was dead	1398.4974528440573
I can not recollect whether it was by steel or by poison only of this I am sure I have dreamed he was dead and you know my dreams never deceive me	159.56922836357649
Be assured then of seeing me soon return	2965.8647143559715
Capital cried Athos you are the king of poets my dear Aramis	380.76039637647733
You speak like the Apocalypse and you are as true as the Gospel	154.04251625586235
There is nothing now to do but to put the address to this letter	78.29151311754072
That is easily done said Aramis	2782.78940679757
He folded the letter fancifully and took up his pen and wrote	63.92953849253142
The three friends looked at one another and laughed they were caught	402.0844768708505
Now said Aramis you will please to understand gentlemen that Bazin alone can carry this letter to Tours	868.8386903388606
My cousin knows nobody but Bazin and places confidence in nobody but him any other person would fail	1548.5846181451232
Besides Bazin is ambitious and learned Bazin has read history gentlemen he knows that Sixtus the Fifth became Pope after having kept pigs	4642.668785813255
Well as he means to enter the Church at the same time as myself he does not despair of becoming Pope in his turn or at least a cardinal	132.5801665909717
You can understand that a man who has such views will never allow himself to be taken or if taken will undergo martyrdom rather than speak	713.3916997998117
Very well said DArtagnan I consent to Bazin with all my heart but grant me Planchet	605.5247448123786
Milady had him one day turned out of doors with sundry blows of a good stick to accelerate his motions	854.5488347375903
Now Planchet has an excellent memory and I will be bound that sooner than relinquish any possible means of vengeance he will allow himself to be beaten to death	164.8031032727414
If your arrangements at Tours are your arrangements Aramis those of London are mine	820.2656279879641
I request then that Planchet may be chosen more particularly as he has already been to London with me and knows how to speak correctly London sir if you please and my master Lord DArtagnan	292.88466472621604
With that you may be satisfied he can make his way both going and returning	361.18269551889614
In that case said Athos Planchet must receive seven hundred livres for going and seven hundred livres for coming back and Bazin three hundred livres for going and three hundred livres for returningthat will reduce the sum to five thousand livres	525.4118311712139
We will each take a thousand livres to be employed as seems good and we will leave a fund of a thousand livres under the guardianship of Monsieur Abb here for extraordinary occasions or common wants	710.3775017923458
My dear Athos said Aramis you speak like Nestor who was as everyone knows the wisest among the Greeks	633.484014876985
Well then said Athos it is agreed	158.0364510996419
Everything considered I am not sorry to retain Grimaud he is accustomed to my ways and I am particular	234.73979817366012
Yesterdays affair must have shaken him a little his voyage would upset him quite	736.4654116230189
Planchet was sent for and instructions were given him	348.85178932292865
The matter had been named to him by DArtagnan who in the first place pointed out the money to him then the glory and then the danger	142.92400585441746
I will carry the letter in the lining of my coat said Planchet and if I am taken I will swallow it	138.8998497271419
Well but then you will not be able to fulfill your commission said DArtagnan	164.52531097222194
You will give me a copy this evening which I shall know by heart tomorrow	247.24999187212077
DArtagnan looked at his friends as if to say Well what did I tell you	57.328956993571936
Now continued he addressing Planchet you have eight days to get an interview with Lord de Winter you have eight days to returnin all sixteen days	394.6250415392479
If on the sixteenth day after your departure at eight oclock in the evening you are not here no moneyeven if it be but five minutes past eight	102.93520002207438
Then monsieur said Planchet you must buy me a watch	233.37569814034617
Take this said Athos with his usual careless generosity giving him his own and be a good lad	345.1573797578607
Remember if you talk if you babble if you get drunk you risk your masters head who has so much confidence in your fidelity and who answers for you	228.51498943830657
But remember also that if by your fault any evil happens to DArtagnan I will find you wherever you may be for the purpose of ripping up your belly	211.24884442678365
Oh monsieur said Planchet humiliated by the suspicion and moreover terrified at the calm air of the Musketeer	335.1147452365405
And I said Porthos rolling his large eyes remember I will skin you alive	937.7408639343622
And I said Aramis with his soft melodius voice remember that I will roast you at a slow fire like a savage	687.41307690045
We will not venture to say whether it was from terror created by the threats or from tenderness at seeing four friends so closely united	525.4701509843642
See Planchet said he these gentlemen only say this out of affection for me but at bottom they all like you	321.3267325604878
Ah monsieur said Planchet I will succeed or I will consent to be cut in quarters and if they do cut me in quarters be assured that not a morsel of me will speak	282.98711507198715
It was decided that Planchet should set out the next day at eight oclock in the morning in order as he had said that he might during the night learn the letter by heart	56.370999363453755
He gained just twelve hours by this engagement he was to be back on the sixteenth day by eight oclock in the evening	75.78058884093286
In the morning as he was mounting his horse DArtagnan who felt at the bottom of his heart a partiality for the duke took Planchet aside	238.97882649516364
When you have given the letter to Lord de Winter and he has read it you will further say to him Watch over his Grace Lord Buckingham for they wish to assassinate him	401.37605768750046
But this Planchet is so serious and important that I have not informed my friends that I would entrust this secret to you and for a captains commission I would not write it	132.93981849787204
Be satisfied monsieur said Planchet you shall see if confidence can be placed in me	263.40027825230226
Mounted on an excellent horse which he was to leave at the end of twenty leagues in order to take the post Planchet set off at a gallop his spirits a little depressed by the triple promise made him by the Musketeers but otherwise as lighthearted as possible	200.27163286129434
Bazin set out the next day for Tours and was allowed eight days for performing his commission	660.3287845709898
The four friends during the period of these two absences had as may well be supposed the eye on the watch the nose to the wind and the ear on the hark	288.7624931873762
Their days were passed in endeavoring to catch all that was said in observing the proceeding of the cardinal and in looking out for all the couriers who arrived	188.78133549137831
More than once an involuntary trembling seized them when called upon for some unexpected service	660.821216390136
They had besides to look constantly to their own proper safety Milady was a phantom which when it had once appeared to people did not allow them to sleep very quietly	401.49384090923303
On the morning of the eighth day Bazin fresh as ever and smiling according to custom entered the cabaret of the Parpaillot as the four friends were sitting down to breakfast saying as had been agreed upon Monsieur Aramis the answer from your cousin	772.6134400737304
The four friends exchanged a joyful glance half of the work was done	341.55765499380584
It is true however that it was the shorter and easier part	973.8537558444816
Aramis blushing in spite of himself took the letter which was in a large coarse hand and not particular for its orthography	298.1194318601792
Good God cried he laughing I quite despair of my poor Michon she will never write like Monsieur de Voiture	524.0319353987294
What does you mean by boor Michon said the Swiss who was chatting with the four friends when the letter came	205.10727453252858
Oh pardieu less than nothing said Aramis a charming little seamstress whom I love dearly and from whose hand I requested a few lines as a sort of keepsake	292.668445442837
The duvil said the Swiss if she is as great a lady as her writing is large you are a lucky fellow gomrade	450.646355651065
Aramis read the letter and passed it to Athos	472.9342388429446
See what she writes to me Athos said he	104.01478350642044
Athos cast a glance over the epistle and to disperse all the suspicions that might have been created read aloud	359.41401206202175
MY COUSIN My sister and I are skillful in interpreting dreams and even entertain great fear of them but of yours it may be said I hope every dream is an illusion	398.648760195873
Adieu Take care of yourself and act so that we may from time to time hear you spoken of	166.34872367994592
And what dream does she mean asked the dragoon who had approached during the reading	194.36745470897395
Yez what s the dream said the Swiss	113.53827273185051
Well pardieu said Aramis it was only this I had a dream and I related it to her	73.55034779638784
Yez yez said the Swiss its simple enough to dell a dream but I neffer dream	2733.8996530710424
You are very fortunate said Athos rising I wish I could say as much	125.0671341940008
Neffer replied the Swiss enchanted that a man like Athos could envy him anything	434.06020476186984
DArtagnan seeing Athos rise did likewise took his arm and went out	113.56686315314059
Porthos and Aramis remained behind to encounter the jokes of the dragoon and the Swiss	327.98589281341066
As to Bazin he went and lay down on a truss of straw and as he had more imagination than the Swiss he dreamed that Aramis having become pope adorned his head with a cardinals hat	307.5599666668546
But as we have said Bazin had not by his fortunate return removed more than a part of the uneasiness which weighed upon the four friends	376.83322714198255
The days of expectation are long and DArtagnan in particular would have wagered that the days were fortyfour hours	612.2387243337982
He forgot the necessary slowness of navigation he exaggerated to himself the power of Milady	290.13777551417235
He credited this woman who appeared to him the equal of a demon with agents as supernatural as herself at the least noise he imagined himself about to be arrested and that Planchet was being brought back to be confronted with himself and his friends	202.37365331760375
Still further his confidence in the worthy Picard at one time so great diminished day by day	638.9541811252292
This anxiety became so great that it even extended to Aramis and Porthos	569.2266545430567
Athos alone remained unmoved as if no danger hovered over him and as if he breathed his customary atmosphere	413.7373608454246
On the sixteenth day in particular these signs were so strong in DArtagnan and his two friends that they could not remain quiet in one place and wandered about like ghosts on the road by which Planchet was expected	245.40943998564012
Really said Athos to them you are not men but children to let a woman terrify you so And what does it amount to after all To be imprisoned	482.36035380148195
Well but we should be taken out of prison Madame Bonacieux was released	483.936470494281
To be decapitated Why every day in the trenches we go cheerfully to expose ourselves to worse than thatfor a bullet may break a leg and I am convinced a surgeon would give us more pain in cutting off a thigh than an executioner in cutting off a head	627.9398481496174
Wait quietly then in two hours in four in six hours at latest Planchet will be here	194.04181518276727
He promised to be here and I have very great faith in Planchet who appears to me to be a very good lad	142.05440384872819
But if he does not come said DArtagnan	379.70686999505887
Well if he does not come it will be because he has been delayed that s all	104.3010048349776
He may have fallen from his horse he may have cut a caper from the deck he may have traveled so fast against the wind as to have brought on a violent catarrh	319.43366463151733
Eh gentlemen let us reckon upon accidents Life is a chaplet of little miseries which the philosopher counts with a smile	954.3550425519988
Be philosophers as I am gentlemen sit down at the table and let us drink	126.72589064272877
Nothing makes the future look so bright as surveying it through a glass of chambertin	359.8135353433046
That s all very well replied DArtagnan but I am tired of fearing when I open a fresh bottle that the wine may come from the cellar of Milady	197.60776363391705
You are very fastidious said Athos such a beautiful woman	349.4734891986363
A woman of mark said Porthos with his loud laugh	109.54546872938076
Athos started passed his hand over his brow to remove the drops of perspiration that burst forth and rose in his turn with a nervous movement he could not repress	78.36381227713792
The day however passed away and the evening came on slowly but finally it came	378.6790344652257
The bars were filled with drinkers	217755.29360609787
Athos who had pocketed his share of the diamond seldom quit the Parpaillot	877.6744780000888
de Busigny who by the by had given them a magnificent dinner a partner worthy of his company	518.2463756404916
They were playing together as usual when seven oclock sounded the patrol was heard passing to double the posts	484.9900885519623
At half past seven the retreat was sounded	1008.8519491058036
We are lost said DArtagnan in the ear of Athos	62.05249467023414
You mean to say we have lost said Athos quietly drawing four pistoles from his pocket and throwing them upon the table	180.5585123492084
Come gentlemen said he they are beating the tattoo	766.466632346973
And Athos went out of the Parpaillot followed by DArtagnan	661.3073486736217
Aramis came behind giving his arm to Porthos	85.6097059047153
Aramis mumbled verses to himself and Porthos from time to time pulled a hair or two from his mustache in sign of despair	276.37083980008185
But all at once a shadow appeared in the darkness the outline of which was familiar to DArtagnan and a wellknown voice said Monsieur I have brought your cloak it is chilly this evening	214.08612635649556
Planchet cried DArtagnan beside himself with joy	24.50050555630035
Well yes Planchet to be sure said Athos what is there so astonishing in that He promised to be back by eight oclock and eight is striking	232.72269894560336
Bravo Planchet you are a lad of your word and if ever you leave your master I will promise you a place in my service	92.74589271850678
Oh no never said Planchet I will never leave Monsieur dArtagnan	187.7835427785744
At the same time DArtagnan felt that Planchet slipped a note into his hand	206.1749867614829
DArtagnan felt a strong inclination to embrace Planchet as he had embraced him on his departure but he feared lest this mark of affection bestowed upon his lackey in the open street might appear extraordinary to passersby and he restrained himself	283.81461220187435
I have the note said he to Athos and to his friends	115.06772455684218
That s well said Athos let us go home and read it	60.43603139382027
The note burned the hand of DArtagnan	118.50543789756745
He wished to hasten their steps but Athos took his arm and passed it under his own and the young man was forced to regulate his pace by that of his friend	80.43026664542562
At length they reached the tent lit a lamp and while Planchet stood at the entrance that the four friends might not be surprised DArtagnan with a trembling hand broke the seal and opened the so anxiously expected letter	339.7341623110951
It contained half a line in a hand perfectly British and with a conciseness as perfectly Spartan	812.3413668134028
DArtagnan translated this for the others	432.32541547568167
Athos took the letter from the hands of DArtagnan approached the lamp set fire to the paper and did not let go till it was reduced to a cinder	154.95179154566435
Then calling Planchet he said Now my lad you may claim your seven hundred livres but you did not run much risk with such a note as that	253.24605509513285
I am not to blame for having tried every means to compress it said Planchet	793.7557460198806
Well cried DArtagnan tell us all about it	15.298189472446252
Dame that s a long job monsieur	257687.2046561235
You are right Planchet said Athos besides the tattoo has been sounded and we should be observed if we kept a light burning much longer than the others	329.86809720033347
Go to bed Planchet and sleep soundly	3804.918258921333
My faith monsieur that will be the first time I have done so for sixteen days	38.46522260991023
Well if you will have the truth and me too said Athos	219.56382817866498
Meantime Milady drunk with passion roaring on the deck like a lioness that has been embarked had been tempted to throw herself into the sea that she might regain the coast for she could not get rid of the thought that she had been insulted by DArtagnan threatened by Athos and that she had quit France without being revenged on them	173.08087867490065
This idea soon became so insupportable to her that at the risk of whatever terrible consequences might result to herself from it she implored the captain to put her on shore but the captain eager to escape from his false positionplaced between French and English cruisers like the bat between the mice and the birdswas in great haste to regain England and positively refused to obey what he took for a womans caprice promising his passenger who had been particularly recommended to him by the cardinal to land her if the sea and the French permitted him at one of the ports of Brittany either at Lorient or Brest	514.8698124487664
But the wind was contrary the sea bad they tacked and kept offshore	6749.636521011705
Nine days after leaving the Charente pale with fatigue and vexation Milady saw only the blue coasts of Finisterre appear	2169.0183533897894
She calculated that to cross this corner of France and return to the cardinal it would take her at least three days	105.65378559399973
Add another day for landing and that would make four	135.03838386582103
Add these four to the nine others that would be thirteen days lostthirteen days during which so many important events might pass in London	680.6647300153152
She reflected likewise that the cardinal would be furious at her return and consequently would be more disposed to listen to the complaints brought against her than to the accusations she brought against others	278.05154534641355
She allowed the vessel to pass Lorient and Brest without repeating her request to the captain who on his part took care not to remind her of it	250.48072054080447
Milady therefore continued her voyage and on the very day that Planchet embarked at Portsmouth for France the messenger of his Eminence entered the port in triumph	443.6877601330162
All the city was agitated by an extraordinary movement	73.84676315054406
Four large vessels recently built had just been launched	345.54388540686466
At the end of the jetty his clothes richly laced with gold glittering as was customary with him with diamonds and precious stones his hat ornamented with a white feather which drooped upon his shoulder Buckingham was seen surrounded by a staff almost as brilliant as himself	490.95057681527595
It was one of those rare and beautiful days in winter when England remembers that there is a sun	862.911032693089
The star of day pale but nevertheless still splendid was setting in the horizon glorifying at once the heavens and the sea with bands of fire and casting upon the towers and the old houses of the city a last ray of gold which made the windows sparkle like the reflection of a conflagration	307.7433801239719
Breathing that sea breeze so much more invigorating and balsamic as the land is approached contemplating all the power of those preparations she was commissioned to destroy all the power of that army which she was to combat aloneshe a woman with a few bags of goldMilady compared herself mentally to Judith the terrible Jewess when she penetrated the camp of the Assyrians and beheld the enormous mass of chariots horses men and arms which a gesture of her hand was to dissipate like a cloud of smoke	425.83315671262164
They entered the roadstead but as they drew near in order to cast anchor a little cutter looking like a coastguard formidably armed approached the merchant vessel and dropped into the sea a boat which directed its course to the ladder	390.06590965316525
This boat contained an officer a mate and eight rowers	1926.486854503099
The officer alone went on board where he was received with all the deference inspired by the uniform	129.87333796939893
The officer conversed a few instants with the captain gave him several papers of which he was the bearer to read and upon the order of the merchant captain the whole crew of the vessel both passengers and sailors were called upon deck	293.06855641660906
When this species of summons was made the officer inquired aloud the point of the brigs departure its route its landings and to all these questions the captain replied without difficulty and without hesitation	505.3637681388122
Then the officer began to pass in review all the people one after the other and stopping when he came to Milady surveyed her very closely but without addressing a single word to her	237.64114923938573
He then returned to the captain said a few words to him and as if from that moment the vessel was under his command he ordered a maneuver which the crew executed immediately	182.80449482000802
Then the vessel resumed its course still escorted by the little cutter which sailed side by side with it menacing it with the mouths of its six cannon	495.38905970381217
The boat followed in the wake of the ship a speck near the enormous mass	435.34046791074593
During the examination of Milady by the officer as may well be imagined Milady on her part was not less scrutinizing in her glances	468.3525979011546
But however great was the power of this woman with eyes of flame in reading the hearts of those whose secrets she wished to divine she met this time with a countenance of such impassivity that no discovery followed her investigation	238.8381688896308
The officer who had stopped in front of her and studied her with so much care might have been twentyfive or twentysix years of age	75.08596683097966
He was of pale complexion with clear blue eyes rather deeply set his mouth fine and well cut remained motionless in its correct lines his chin strongly marked denoted that strength of will which in the ordinary Britannic type denotes mostly nothing but obstinacy a brow a little receding as is proper for poets enthusiasts and soldiers was scarcely shaded by short thin hair which like the beard which covered the lower part of his face was of a beautiful deep chestnut color	982.4573689811451
When they entered the port it was already night	136.2915758978058
The fog increased the darkness and formed round the sternlights and lanterns of the jetty a circle like that which surrounds the moon when the weather threatens to become rainy	623.0627350476188
The air they breathed was heavy damp and cold	1121.0960401247694
Milady that woman so courageous and firm shivered in spite of herself	336.13295375264613
The officer desired to have Miladys packages pointed out to him and ordered them to be placed in the boat	217.97850167959444
When this operation was complete he invited her to descend by offering her his hand	270.66128101616624
Milady looked at this man and hesitated	491.0974778188334
Who are you sir asked she who has the kindness to trouble yourself so particularly on my account	156.4753944691952
You may perceive madame by my uniform that I am an officer in the English navy replied the young man	101.55022800131036
But is it the custom for the officers in the English navy to place themselves at the service of their female compatriots when they land in a port of Great Britain and carry their gallantry so far as to conduct them ashore	373.2369669784009
Yes madame it is the custom not from gallantry but prudence that in time of war foreigners should be conducted to particular htels in order that they may remain under the eye of the government until full information can be obtained about them	441.34353193753293
These words were pronounced with the most exact politeness and the most perfect calmness	127.28309730738978
Nevertheless they had not the power of convincing Milady	2187.507966387183
But I am not a foreigner sir said she with an accent as pure as ever was heard between Portsmouth and Manchester my name is Lady Clarik and this measure	513.0905215219846
This measure is general madame and you will seek in vain to evade it	132.7088625322043
I will follow you then sir	304.97916231033554
Accepting the hand of the officer she began the descent of the ladder at the foot of which the boat waited	148.35167670001138
A large cloak was spread at the stern the officer requested her to sit down upon this cloak and placed himself beside her	215.54036870920243
Row said he to the sailors	10093.976487800994
The eight oars fell at once into the sea making but a single sound giving but a single stroke and the boat seemed to fly over the surface of the water	122.06140779059253
In five minutes they gained the land	230.01487220237092
The officer leaped to the pier and offered his hand to Milady	290.310594806201
Is this carriage for us asked Milady	9294.600428458913
The htel then is far away	627.0125811992481
At the other end of the town	33.54826372725687
Very well said Milady and she resolutely entered the carriage	1240.0601883570964
The officer saw that the baggage was fastened carefully behind the carriage and this operation ended he took his place beside Milady and shut the door	328.32114822311513
Immediately without any order being given or his place of destination indicated the coachman set off at a rapid pace and plunged into the streets of the city	124.64554014369283
So strange a reception naturally gave Milady ample matter for reflection so seeing that the young officer did not seem at all disposed for conversation she reclined in her corner of the carriage and one after the other passed in review all the surmises which presented themselves to her mind	414.57269267264775
At the end of a quarter of an hour however surprised at the length of the journey she leaned forward toward the door to see whither she was being conducted	84.04094323520727
Houses were no longer to be seen trees appeared in the darkness like great black phantoms chasing one another	853.1770556135194
But we are no longer in the city sir said she	183.8705336443616
I beg you to understand sir I will go no farther unless you tell me whither you are taking me	120.03125311398031
Oh this is too much cried Milady	4108.802285732108
No voice replied to hers the carriage continued to roll on with rapidity the officer seemed a statue	366.16523407815123
Milady looked at the officer with one of those terrible expressions peculiar to her countenance and which so rarely failed of their effect anger made her eyes flash in the darkness	209.43317713534287
Milady tried to open the door in order to throw herself out	22.971337701915363
Take care madame said the young man coolly you will kill yourself in jumping	225.3233490059255
The officer leaned forward looked at her in his turn and appeared surprised to see that face just before so beautiful distorted with passion and almost hideous	263.54414726940087
The artful creature at once comprehended that she was injuring herself by allowing him thus to read her soul she collected her features and in a complaining voice said In the name of heaven sir tell me if it is to you if it is to your government if it is to an enemy I am to attribute the violence that is done me	134.84546455784826
No violence will be offered to you madame and what happens to you is the result of a very simple measure which we are obliged to adopt with all who land in England	136.19563676044552
Then you do nt know me sir	21.585995116887037
It is the first time I have had the honor of seeing you	9.357018506739433
And on your honor you have no cause of hatred against me	59.98521764266214
There was so much serenity coolness mildness even in the voice of the young man that Milady felt reassured	428.69170805733376
At length after a journey of nearly an hour the carriage stopped before an iron gate which closed an avenue leading to a castle severe in form massive and isolated	473.0928357547102
Then as the wheels rolled over a fine gravel Milady could hear a vast roaring which she at once recognized as the noise of the sea dashing against some steep cliff	646.336679136321
The carriage passed under two arched gateways and at length stopped in a court large dark and square	439.3597874151043
Almost immediately the door of the carriage was opened the young man sprang lightly out and presented his hand to Milady who leaned upon it and in her turn alighted with tolerable calmness	94.04821785072842
Still then I am a prisoner said Milady looking around her and bringing back her eyes with a most gracious smile to the young officer but I feel assured it will not be for long added she	167.97753582261575
My own conscience and your politeness sir are the guarantees of that	288.6682389192174
However flattering this compliment the officer made no reply but drawing from his belt a little silver whistle such as boatswains use in ships of war he whistled three times with three different modulations	548.7743990902403
Immediately several men appeared who unharnessed the smoking horses and put the carriage into a coach house	565.9893230452275
Then the officer with the same calm politeness invited his prisoner to enter the house	296.40811463410427
She with a stillsmiling countenance took his arm and passed with him under a low arched door which by a vaulted passage lighted only at the farther end led to a stone staircase around an angle of stone	270.0112843605514
They then came to a massive door which after the introduction into the lock of a key which the young man carried with him turned heavily upon its hinges and disclosed the chamber destined for Milady	223.82798214418935
With a single glance the prisoner took in the apartment in its minutest details	520.8184165885914
It was a chamber whose furniture was at once appropriate for a prisoner or a free man and yet bars at the windows and outside bolts at the door decided the question in favor of the prison	263.43690415391944
In an instant all the strength of mind of this creature though drawn from the most vigorous sources abandoned her she sank into a large easy chair with her arms crossed her head lowered and expecting every instant to see a judge enter to interrogate her	400.05289846771825
But no one entered except two or three marines who brought her trunks and packages deposited them in a corner and retired without speaking	267.94322982002836
The officer superintended all these details with the same calmness Milady had constantly seen in him never pronouncing a word himself and making himself obeyed by a gesture of his hand or a sound of his whistle	198.78819365461695
It might have been said that between this man and his inferiors spoken language did not exist or had become useless	538.2441860286668
At length Milady could hold out no longer she broke the silence	230.8363240208067
In the name of heaven sir cried she what means all that is passing Put an end to my doubts I have courage enough for any danger I can foresee for every misfortune which I understand	261.52788038421346
Where am I and why am I here If I am free why these bars and these doors If I am a prisoner what crime have I committed	380.155347851571
You are here in the apartment destined for you madame	579.5733849660489
I received orders to go and take charge of you on the sea and to conduct you to this castle	112.74031519430403
This order I believe I have accomplished with all the exactness of a soldier but also with the courtesy of a gentleman	79.52386090474332
There terminates at least to the present moment the duty I had to fulfill toward you the rest concerns another person	834.4149400066087
And who is that other person asked Milady warmly	9401.910290222097
Can you not tell me his name	196.30974093084012
At the moment a great jingling of spurs was heard on the stairs	183.39089237206622
Some voices passed and faded away and the sound of a single footstep approached the door	60.17570115760582
That person is here madame said the officer leaving the entrance open and drawing himself up in an attitude of respect	112.14328863696639
At the same time the door opened a man appeared on the threshold	31.1007975306809
He was without a hat carried a sword and flourished a handkerchief in his hand	166.03036746792776
Milady thought she recognized this shadow in the gloom she supported herself with one hand upon the arm of the chair and advanced her head as if to meet a certainty	62.38632715290433
The stranger advanced slowly and as he advanced after entering into the circle of light projected by the lamp Milady involuntarily drew back	352.35572202466733
Then when she had no longer any doubt she cried in a state of stupor What my brother is it you	118.37472362960928
Yes fair lady replied Lord de Winter making a bow half courteous half ironical it is I myself	475.948837639096
But this is a frightful abuse of power	823.8797980398529
No highsounding words Let us sit down and chat quietly as brother and sister ought to do	559.9202209254241
Then turning toward the door and seeing that the young officer was waiting for his last orders he said	67.84150939148671
All is well I thank you now leave us alone Mr	291.8639706569422
During the time which Lord de Winter took to shut the door close a shutter and draw a chair near to his sisterinlaws fauteuil Milady anxiously thoughtful plunged her glance into the depths of possibility and discovered all the plan of which she could not even obtain a glance as long as she was ignorant into whose hands she had fallen	286.5605289690492
She knew her brotherinlaw to be a worthy gentleman a bold hunter an intrepid player enterprising with women but by no means remarkable for his skill in intrigues	1293.9507766230497
How had he discovered her arrival and caused her to be seized Why did he detain her	311.3326817296112
Athos had dropped some words which proved that the conversation she had with the cardinal had fallen into outside ears but she could not suppose that he had dug a countermine so promptly and so boldly	239.52041719021818
She rather feared that her preceding operations in England might have been discovered	506.7006740825768
Buckingham might have guessed that it was she who had cut off the two studs and avenge himself for that little treachery but Buckingham was incapable of going to any excess against a woman particularly if that woman was supposed to have acted from a feeling of jealousy	271.5482611616815
This supposition appeared to her most reasonable	2098.655421343606
It seemed to her that they wanted to revenge the past and not to anticipate the future	131.26365248404542
At all events she congratulated herself upon having fallen into the hands of her brotherinlaw with whom she reckoned she could deal very easily rather than into the hands of an acknowledged and intelligent enemy	260.911781831701
Yes let us chat brother said she with a kind of cheerfulness decided as she was to draw from the conversation in spite of all the dissimulation Lord de Winter could bring the revelations of which she stood in need to regulate her future conduct	193.90523427795526
You have then decided to come to England again said Lord de Winter in spite of the resolutions you so often expressed in Paris never to set your feet on British ground	289.3271159552918
Milady replied to this question by another question	551.3990816269595
To begin with tell me said she how have you watched me so closely as to be aware beforehand not only of my arrival but even of the day the hour and the port at which I should arrive	112.60836485506763
Lord de Winter adopted the same tactics as Milady thinking that as his sisterinlaw employed them they must be the best	825.1474070400162
But tell me my dear sister replied he what makes you come to England	150.47514269192493
I come to see you replied Milady without knowing how much she aggravated by this reply the suspicions to which DArtagnans letter had given birth in the mind of her brotherinlaw and only desiring to gain the good will of her auditor by a falsehood	381.32869592747033
Ah to see me said de Winter cunningly	68881.95995673869
To be sure to see you	13.030952635357547
What is there astonishing in that	25.032912992831683
And you had no other object in coming to England but to see me	246.82796001586024
So it was for me alone you have taken the trouble to cross the Channel	131.5266565227731
The deuce What tenderness my sister	281.20511203900674
But am I not your nearest relative demanded Milady with a tone of the most touching ingenuousness	1219.57188990806
And my only heir are you not said Lord de Winter in his turn fixing his eyes on those of Milady	89.25054465661687
Whatever command she had over herself Milady could not help starting and as in pronouncing the last words Lord de Winter placed his hand upon the arm of his sister this start did not escape him	245.88964766293506
In fact the blow was direct and severe	1824.8574577862978
The first idea that occurred to Miladys mind was that she had been betrayed by Kitty and that she had recounted to the baron the selfish aversion toward himself of which she had imprudently allowed some marks to escape before her servant	377.9786631240181
She also recollected the furious and imprudent attack she had made upon DArtagnan when he spared the life of her brother	311.6336375036605
I do not understand my Lord said she in order to gain time and make her adversary speak out	244.83154317174825
What do you mean to say Is there any secret meaning concealed beneath your words	563.7242213402264
Oh my God no said Lord de Winter with apparent good nature	1195.7827422020848
You wish to see me and you come to England	147.74434046598088
I learn this desire or rather I suspect that you feel it and in order to spare you all the annoyances of a nocturnal arrival in a port and all the fatigues of landing I send one of my officers to meet you I place a carriage at his orders and he brings you hither to this castle of which I am governor whither I come every day and where in order to satisfy our mutual desire of seeing each other I have prepared you a chamber	177.11879003586034
What is there more astonishing in all that I have said to you than in what you have told me	32.62083452900849
No what I think astonishing is that you should expect my coming	184.74634690386588
And yet that is the most simple thing in the world my dear sister	52.83794378887306
Have you not observed that the captain of your little vessel on entering the roadstead sent forward in order to obtain permission to enter the port a little boat bearing his logbook and the register of his voyagers I am commandant of the port	291.33557432124326
I recognized your name in it	274.29506505678563
My heart told me what your mouth has just confirmedthat is to say with what view you have exposed yourself to the dangers of a sea so perilous or at least so troublesome at this momentand I sent my cutter to meet you	252.712123580996
Milady knew that Lord de Winter lied and she was the more alarmed	524.2558759143382
My brother continued she was not that my Lord Buckingham whom I saw on the jetty this evening as we arrived	332.5851505348586
Ah I can understand how the sight of him struck you replied Lord de Winter	268.6129110451073
You came from a country where he must be very much talked of and I know that his armaments against France greatly engage the attention of your friend the cardinal	233.92222079736243
My friend the cardinal cried Milady seeing that on this point as on the other Lord de Winter seemed well instructed	554.9004424635873
Is he not your friend replied the baron negligently	1069.989467263778
Ah pardon I thought so but we will return to my Lord Duke presently	706.0221094211227
Let us not depart from the sentimental turn our conversation had taken	452.2030390249343
You came you say to see me	73.11396346726491
Well I reply that you shall be served to the height of your wishes and that we shall see each other every day	54.28533457297411
Am I then to remain here eternally demanded Milady with a certain terror	1258.3206670898594
Do you find yourself badly lodged sister Demand anything you want and I will hasten to have you furnished with it	635.2695004596557
But I have neither my women nor my servants	223.4930631784245
Tell me on what footing your household was established by your first husband and although I am only your brotherinlaw I will arrange one similar	225.95065810880035
My first husband cried Milady looking at Lord de Winter with eyes almost starting from their sockets	529.2567511651517
I do nt speak of my brother	86.19328905044888
If you have forgotten as he is still living I can write to him and he will send me information on the subject	69.82881787921387
A cold sweat burst from the brow of Milady	231.17849383111414
You jest said she in a hollow voice	18.018946750985545
Do I look so asked the baron rising and going a step backward	508.59693982267913
Or rather you insult me continued she pressing with her stiffened hands the two arms of her easy chair and raising herself upon her wrists	257.4377174256675
I insult you said Lord de Winter with contempt	350.0062617495127
In truth madame do you think that can be possible	111.45483823471132
Indeed sir said Milady you must be either drunk or mad	330.88131945447884
Leave the room and send me a woman	27.463430594799828
Women are very indiscreet my sister	228.41164982657955
Can not I serve you as a waiting maid By that means all our secrets will remain in the family	307.53976751338723
Insolent cried Milady and as if acted upon by a spring she bounded toward the baron who awaited her attack with his arms crossed but nevertheless with one hand on the hilt of his sword	151.360862688829
I know you are accustomed to assassinate people but I warn you I shall defend myself even against you	116.56823624437178
You have all the appearance of being cowardly enough to lift your hand against a woman	152.80326587257176
Perhaps so and I have an excuse for mine would not be the first hand of a man that has been placed upon you I imagine	69.01688825295729
And the baron pointed with a slow and accusing gesture to the left shoulder of Milady which he almost touched with his finger	262.10421602663587
Milady uttered a deep inward shriek and retreated to a corner of the room like a panther which crouches for a spring	313.56277647731287
Oh growl as much as you please cried Lord de Winter but do nt try to bite for I warn you that it would be to your disadvantage	138.3080175244038
There are here no procurators who regulate successions beforehand	41027.87091506448
There is no knighterrant to come and seek a quarrel with me on account of the fair lady I detain a prisoner but I have judges quite ready who will quickly dispose of a woman so shameless as to glide a bigamist into the bed of Lord de Winter my brother	299.24230657348
And these judges I warn you will soon send you to an executioner who will make both your shoulders alike	258.8510905483408
The eyes of Milady darted such flashes that although he was a man and armed before an unarmed woman he felt the chill of fear glide through his whole frame	356.15809101902875
However he continued all the same but with increasing warmth Yes I can very well understand that after having inherited the fortune of my brother it would be very agreeable to you to be my heir likewise but know beforehand if you kill me or cause me to be killed my precautions are taken	193.79316514620325
Not a penny of what I possess will pass into your hands	69.34180729392867
Were you not already rich enoughyou who possess nearly a million And could you not stop your fatal career if you did not do evil for the infinite and supreme joy of doing it Oh be assured if the memory of my brother were not sacred to me you should rot in a state dungeon or satisfy the curiosity of sailors at Tyburn	360.9387855643188
I will be silent but you must endure your captivity quietly	488.7611226136816
In fifteen or twenty days I shall set out for La Rochelle with the army but on the eve of my departure a vessel which I shall see depart will take you hence and convey you to our colonies in the south	173.58947949297954
And be assured that you shall be accompanied by one who will blow your brains out at the first attempt you make to return to England or the Continent	173.48069726159676
Milady listened with an attention that dilated her inflamed eyes	1518.6625385000123
Yes at present continued Lord de Winter you will remain in this castle	140.82399362981732
The walls are thick the doors strong and the bars solid besides your window opens immediately over the sea	1865.5379949833302
The men of my crew who are devoted to me for life and death mount guard around this apartment and watch all the passages that lead to the courtyard	273.8002553459192
Even if you gained the yard there would still be three iron gates for you to pass	445.5797757255336
A step a gesture a word on your part denoting an effort to escape and you are to be fired upon	167.9900822553264
If they kill you English justice will be under an obligation to me for having saved it trouble	162.66012365252988
Ah I see your features regain their calmness your countenance recovers its assurance	4206.015593950481
You are saying to yourself Fifteen days twenty days Bah I have an inventive mind before that is expired some idea will occur to me	617.7751638456574
I shall meet with a victim	702.9863178100311
Before fifteen days are gone by I shall be away from here	70.62315322713783
Milady finding her thoughts betrayed dug her nails into her flesh to subdue every emotion that might give to her face any expression except agony	811.0213774099313
Lord de Winter continued The officer who commands here in my absence you have already seen and therefore know him	228.63426465366823
He knows how as you must have observed to obey an orderfor you did not I am sure come from Portsmouth hither without endeavoring to make him speak	385.05813277444867
What do you say of him Could a statue of marble have been more impassive and more mute You have already tried the power of your seductions upon many men and unfortunately you have always succeeded but I give you leave to try them upon this one	338.4866403358459
Pardieu if you succeed with him I pronounce you the demon himself	293.4117060636994
He went toward the door and opened it hastily	69.5697554871434
Wait a minute longer and I will introduce him to you	24.87028483793376
There followed between these two personages a strange silence during which the sound of a slow and regular step was heard approaching	207.18463756684136
Shortly a human form appeared in the shade of the corridor and the young lieutenant with whom we are already acquainted stopped at the threshold to receive the orders of the baron	78.08123404858243
Come in my dear John said Lord de Winter come in and shut the door	100.32555752605332
Now said the baron look at this woman	35.89845142866102
She is young she is beautiful she possesses all earthly seductions	5658.403787450374
Well she is a monster who at twentyfive years of age has been guilty of as many crimes as you could read of in a year in the archives of our tribunals	158.38422079706356
Her voice prejudices her hearers in her favor her beauty serves as a bait to her victims her body even pays what she promisesI must do her that justice	846.4653413478926
She will try to seduce you perhaps she will try to kill you	82.33057056314925
I have extricated you from misery Felton I have caused you to be named lieutenant I once saved your life you know on what occasion	272.618448440071
I am for you not only a protector but a friend not only a benefactor but a father	114.06308221288633
This woman has come back again into England for the purpose of conspiring against my life	140.95758304490985
I hold this serpent in my hands	17.530068196293666
Well I call you and say to you Friend Felton John my child guard me and more particularly guard yourself against this woman	964.6975013399904
Swear by your hopes of salvation to keep her safely for the chastisement she has merited	641.7980366258973
John Felton I trust your word John Felton I put faith in your loyalty	2731.5441358861576
My Lord said the young officer summoning to his mild countenance all the hatred he could find in his heart my Lord I swear all shall be done as you desire	243.4856557547025
Milady received this look like a resigned victim it was impossible to imagine a more submissive or a more mild expression than that which prevailed on her beautiful countenance	195.26321862580588
Lord de Winter himself could scarcely recognize the tigress who a minute before prepared apparently for a fight	639.4056337199747
She is not to leave this chamber understand John continued the baron	2619.7421687138185
She is to correspond with nobody she is to speak to no one but youif you will do her the honor to address a word to her	131.4257750668613
That is sufficient my Lord I have sworn	139.97725167079557
And now madame try to make your peace with God for you are judged by men	175.4052783005303
Milady let her head sink as if crushed by this sentence	221.10491878732924
Lord de Winter went out making a sign to Felton who followed him shutting the door after him	128.30708522825668
One instant after the heavy step of a marine who served as sentinel was heard in the corridorhis ax in his girdle and his musket on his shoulder	246.59588886738229
Milady remained for some minutes in the same position for she thought they might perhaps be examining her through the keyhole she then slowly raised her head which had resumed its formidable expression of menace and defiance ran to the door to listen looked out of her window and returning to bury herself again in her large armchair she reflected	177.84227316218556
Meanwhile the cardinal looked anxiously for news from England but no news arrived that was not annoying and threatening	446.7452188096601
Although La Rochelle was invested however certain success might appearthanks to the precautions taken and above all to the dyke which prevented the entrance of any vessel into the besieged citythe blockade might last a long time yet	834.7958949825017
This was a great affront to the kings army and a great inconvenience to the cardinal who had no longer it is true to embroil Louis XIII	176.06247875540254
with Anne of Austriafor that affair was overbut he had to adjust matters for M	812.4600415471764
de Bassompierre who was embroiled with the Duc dAngoulme	896.9989417164319
As to Monsieur who had begun the siege he left to the cardinal the task of finishing it	242.6097313404917
The city notwithstanding the incredible perseverance of its mayor had attempted a sort of mutiny for a surrender the mayor had hanged the mutineers	693.5092670959867
This execution quieted the illdisposed who resolved to allow themselves to die of hungerthis death always appearing to them more slow and less sure than strangulation	510.1755779880677
On their side from time to time the besiegers took the messengers which the Rochellais sent to Buckingham or the spies which Buckingham sent to the Rochellais	525.3088419151502
In one case or the other the trial was soon over	406.3429466687958
The cardinal pronounced the single word Hanged The king was invited to come and see the hanging	423.7440112368578
He came languidly placing himself in a good situation to see all the details	52.84234121578491
This amused him sometimes a little and made him endure the siege with patience but it did not prevent his getting very tired or from talking at every moment of returning to Parisso that if the messengers and the spies had failed his Eminence notwithstanding all his inventiveness would have found himself much embarrassed	376.4906265013807
Nevertheless time passed on and the Rochellais did not surrender	627.9473297374357
The last spy that was taken was the bearer of a letter	92.87135528214942
This letter told Buckingham that the city was at an extremity but instead of adding If your succor does not arrive within fifteen days we will surrender it added quite simply If your succor comes not within fifteen days we shall all be dead with hunger when it comes	612.4734568068355
The Rochellais then had no hope but in Buckingham	1399.3651342623587
It was evident that if they one day learned positively that they must not count on Buckingham their courage would fail with their hope	844.548196440274
The cardinal looked then with great impatience for the news from England which would announce to him that Buckingham would not come	199.24449840198508
The question of carrying the city by assault though often debated in the council of the king had been always rejected	845.0438739450418
In the first place La Rochelle appeared impregnable	7099.728613057252
Then the cardinal whatever he said very well knew that the horror of bloodshed in this encounter in which Frenchman would combat against Frenchman was a retrograde movement of sixty years impressed upon his policy and the cardinal was at that period what we now call a man of progress	354.23810748901127
In fact the sack of La Rochelle and the assassination of three of four thousand Huguenots who allowed themselves to be killed would resemble too closely in 1628 the massacre of St	434.4116907303435
Bartholomew in 1572 and then above all this this extreme measure which was not at all repugnant to the king good Catholic as he was always fell before this argument of the besieging generalsLa Rochelle is impregnable except to famine	892.7588043524764
The cardinal could not drive from his mind the fear he entertained of his terrible emissaryfor he comprehended the strange qualities of this woman sometimes a serpent sometimes a lion	311.53791395729405
Had she betrayed him Was she dead He knew her well enough in all cases to know that whether acting for or against him as a friend or an enemy she would not remain motionless without great impediments but whence did these impediments arise That was what he could not know	458.0890681702597
And yet he reckoned and with reason on Milady	2473.5680894353363
He had divined in the past of this woman terrible things which his red mantle alone could cover and he felt from one cause or another that this woman was his own as she could look to no other but himself for a support superior to the danger which threatened her	277.9984303250097
He resolved then to carry on the war alone and to look for no success foreign to himself but as we look for a fortunate chance	404.2597973328075
He continued to press the raising of the famous dyke which was to starve La Rochelle	611.4241610914991
Meanwhile he cast his eyes over that unfortunate city which contained so much deep misery and so many heroic virtues and recalling the saying of Louis XI	720.4849204246731
his political predecessor as he himself was the predecessor of Robespierre he repeated this maxim of Tristans gossip Divide in order to reign	1180.6916343825244
when besieging Paris had loaves and provisions thrown over the walls	374.9496228473366
The cardinal had little notes thrown over in which he represented to the Rochellais how unjust selfish and barbarous was the conduct of their leaders	609.2048045454235
These leaders had corn in abundance and would not let them partake of it they adopted as a maximfor they too had maximsthat it was of very little consequence that women children and old men should die so long as the men who were to defend the walls remained strong and healthy	441.9149130887422
Up to that time whether from devotedness or from want of power to act against it this maxim without being generally adopted nevertheless passed from theory into practice but the notes did it injury	1079.4006279828523
The notes reminded the men that the children women and old men whom they allowed to die were their sons their wives and their fathers and that it would be more just for everyone to be reduced to the common misery in order that equal conditions should give birth to unanimous resolutions	369.3585736370199
These notes had all the effect that he who wrote them could expect in that they induced a great number of the inhabitants to open private negotiations with the royal army	384.2474732154053
But at the moment when the cardinal saw his means already bearing fruit and applauded himself for having put it in action an inhabitant of La Rochelle who had contrived to pass the royal linesGod knows how such was the watchfulness of Bassompierre Schomberg and the Duc dAngoulme themselves watched over by the cardinalan inhabitant of La Rochelle we say entered the city coming from Portsmouth and saying that he had seen a magnificent fleet ready to sail within eight days	630.5867786197963
Still further Buckingham announced to the mayor that at length the great league was about to declare itself against France and that the kingdom would be at once invaded by the English Imperial and Spanish armies	339.52421366354935
This letter was read publicly in all parts of the city	31.78828205688494
Copies were put up at the corners of the streets and even they who had begun to open negotiations interrupted them being resolved to await the succor so pompously announced	380.46264637256314
This unexpected circumstance brought back Richelieus former anxiety and forced him in spite of himself once more to turn his eyes to the other side of the sea	153.5765584891028
During this time exempt from the anxiety of its only and true chief the royal army led a joyous life neither provisions nor money being wanting in the camp	1180.5146366954007
All the corps rivaled one another in audacity and gaiety	1864.3570012067719
To take spies and hang them to make hazardous expeditions upon the dyke or the sea to imagine wild plans and to execute them coollysuch were the pastimes which made the army find these days short which were not only so long to the Rochellais a prey to famine and anxiety but even to the cardinal who blockaded them so closely	588.5153773969598
Sometimes when the cardinal always on horseback like the lowest gendarme of the army cast a pensive glance over those works so slowly keeping pace with his wishes which the engineers brought from all the corners of France were executing under his orders if he met a Musketeer of the company of Trville he drew near and looked at him in a peculiar manner and not recognizing in him one of our four companions he turned his penetrating look and profound thoughts in another direction	279.39575195549685
One day when oppressed with a mortal weariness of mind without hope in the negotiations with the city without news from England the cardinal went out without any other aim than to be out of doors and accompanied only by Cahusac and La Houdinire strolled along the beach	429.7656652589799
Mingling the immensity of his dreams with the immensity of the ocean he came his horse going at a foots pace to a hill from the top of which he perceived behind a hedge reclining on the sand and catching in its passage one of those rays of the sun so rare at this period of the year seven men surrounded by empty bottles	186.47092896859183
Four of these men were our Musketeers preparing to listen to a letter one of them had just received	200.73653143872076
This letter was so important that it made them forsake their cards and their dice on the drumhead	613.4355888352073
The other three were occupied in opening an enormous flagon of Collicure wine these were the lackeys of these gentlemen	505.254646706659
The cardinal was as we have said in very low spirits and nothing when he was in that state of mind increased his depression so much as gaiety in others	171.35121249080996
Besides he had another strange fancy which was always to believe that the causes of his sadness created the gaiety of others	245.6052473234179
Making a sign to La Houdinire and Cahusac to stop he alighted from his horse and went toward these suspected merry companions hoping by means of the sand which deadened the sound of his steps and of the hedge which concealed his approach to catch some words of this conversation which appeared so interesting	262.61916827643165
At ten paces from the hedge he recognized the talkative Gascon and as he had already perceived that these men were Musketeers he did not doubt that the three others were those called the Inseparables that is to say Athos Porthos and Aramis	254.73717341753704
It may be supposed that his desire to hear the conversation was augmented by this discovery	197.91824101392615
His eyes took a strange expression and with the step of a tigercat he advanced toward the hedge but he had not been able to catch more than a few vague syllables without any positive sense when a sonorous and short cry made him start and attracted the attention of the Musketeers	205.6118521335763
You are speaking you scoundrel said Athos rising upon his elbow and transfixing Grimaud with his flaming look	302.1945275720315
Grimaud therefore added nothing to his speech but contented himself with pointing his index finger in the direction of the hedge announcing by this gesture the cardinal and his escort	301.68931735985075
With a single bound the Musketeers were on their feet and saluted with respect	554.0438238147372
It appears that Messieurs the Musketeers keep guard said he	1826.6031657750057
Are the English expected by land or do the Musketeers consider themselves superior officers	3005.6499824358384
Monseigneur replied Athos for amid the general fright he alone had preserved the noble calmness and coolness that never forsook him Monseigneur the Musketeers when they are not on duty or when their duty is over drink and play at dice and they are certainly superior officers to their lackeys	664.8622066207482
Lackeys who have the order to warn their masters when anyone passes are not lackeys they are sentinels	817.8568356068232
Your Eminence may perceive that if we had not taken this precaution we should have been exposed to allowing you to pass without presenting you our respects or offering you our thanks for the favor you have done us in uniting us	188.25428267341587
DArtagnan continued Athos you who but lately were so anxious for such an opportunity for expressing your gratitude to Monseigneur here it is avail yourself of it	337.45955025370404
These words were pronounced with that imperturbable phlegm which distinguished Athos in the hour of danger and with that excessive politeness which made of him at certain moments a king more majestic than kings by birth	559.5885296668307
DArtagnan came forward and stammered out a few words of gratitude which soon expired under the gloomy looks of the cardinal	128.85027457490295
It does not signify gentlemen continued the cardinal without appearing to be in the least swerved from his first intention by the diversion which Athos had started it does not signify gentlemen	414.6932489106675
I do not like to have simple soldiers because they have the advantage of serving in a privileged corps thus to play the great lords discipline is the same for them as for everybody else	494.25652266911624
Athos allowed the cardinal to finish his sentence completely and bowed in sign of assent	272.93875305144473
Then he resumed in his turn Discipline Monseigneur has I hope in no way been forgotten by us	794.695410887537
We are not on duty and we believed that not being on duty we were at liberty to dispose of our time as we pleased	235.23039026901697
If we are so fortunate as to have some particular duty to perform for your Eminence we are ready to obey you	161.81190067018156
Your Eminence may perceive continued Athos knitting his brow for this sort of investigation began to annoy him that we have not come out without our arms	211.4793171648394
And he showed the cardinal with his finger the four muskets piled near the drum on which were the cards and dice	382.5257033230647
Your Eminence may believe added DArtagnan that we would have come to meet you if we could have supposed it was Monseigneur coming toward us with so few attendants	192.74004455113592
The cardinal bit his mustache and even his lips a little	93.84874859538998
Do you know what you look like all together as you are armed and guarded by your lackeys said the cardinal	353.63561941368096
Oh as to that Monseigneur it is true said Athos we do conspire as your Eminence might have seen the other morning	341.3872397411039
Only we conspire against the Rochellais	85700.01210630321
Ah you gentlemen of policy replied the cardinal knitting his brow in his turn the secret of many unknown things might perhaps be found in your brains if we could read them as you read that letter which you concealed as soon as you saw me coming	138.9677274886341
The color mounted to the face of Athos and he made a step toward his Eminence	137.7685143620795
One might think you really suspected us monseigneur and we were undergoing a real interrogatory	2265.359259664773
If it be so we trust your Eminence will deign to explain yourself and we should then at least be acquainted with our real position	264.84851473304417
And if it were an interrogatory replied the cardinal	942.1338001502994
Others besides you have undergone such Monsieur Athos and have replied thereto	2802.3394755564464
Thus I have told your Eminence that you had but to question us and we are ready to reply	141.39669961734637
What was that letter you were about to read Monsieur Aramis and which you so promptly concealed	202.69383501494016
Ah yes I see said the cardinal we must be discreet with this sort of letters but nevertheless we may show them to a confessor and you know I have taken orders	136.91527333368813
Monseigneur said Athos with a calmness the more terrible because he risked his head in making this reply the letter is a womans letter but it is neither signed Marion de Lorme nor Madame dAiguillon	610.0067083071451
The cardinal became as pale as death lightning darted from his eyes	116.0378271162016
He turned round as if to give an order to Cahusac and Houdinire	393.61825287293976
Athos saw the movement he made a step toward the muskets upon which the other three friends had fixed their eyes like men illdisposed to allow themselves to be taken	147.47461802254708
The cardinalists were three the Musketeers lackeys included were seven	18870.868817498013
He judged that the match would be so much the less equal if Athos and his companions were really plotting and by one of those rapid turns which he always had at command all his anger faded away into a smile	325.91704286602317
Well well said he you are brave young men proud in daylight faithful in darkness	481.2423561721798
We can find no fault with you for watching over yourselves when you watch so carefully over others	526.3077240272595
Gentlemen I have not forgotten the night in which you served me as an escort to the Red Dovecot	242.84175802749547
If there were any danger to be apprehended on the road I am going I would request you to accompany me but as there is none remain where you are finish your bottles your game and your letter	148.18151613046618
And remounting his horse which Cahusac led to him he saluted them with his hand and rode away	260.62548795658023
The four young men standing and motionless followed him with their eyes without speaking a single word until he had disappeared	82.00134574431563
Then they looked at one another	95.57162487969231
The countenances of all gave evidence of terror for notwithstanding the friendly adieu of his Eminence they plainly perceived that the cardinal went away with rage in his heart	417.2678705284656
Athos alone smiled with a selfpossessed disdainful smile	6729.628797578655
When the cardinal was out of hearing and sight That Grimaud kept bad watch cried Porthos who had a great inclination to vent his illhumor on somebody	834.568258855866
Grimaud was about to reply to excuse himself	134.50758970046599
Athos lifted his finger and Grimaud was silent	491.98939510013986
Would you have given up the letter Aramis said DArtagnan	549.9029100480382
I said Aramis in his most flutelike tone I had made up my mind	79.05082299749371
If he had insisted upon the letter being given up to him I would have presented the letter to him with one hand and with the other I would have run my sword through his body	52.37984064621553
I expected as much said Athos and that was why I threw myself between you and him	155.442219818802
Indeed this man is very much to blame for talking thus to other men one would say he had never had to do with any but women and children	285.61257479210843
My dear Athos I admire you but nevertheless we were in the wrong after all	132.62972379352772
How in the wrong said Athos	4777.633734705352
Whose then is the air we breathe Whose is the ocean upon which we look Whose is the sand upon which we were reclining Whose is that letter of your mistress Do these belong to the cardinal Upon my honor this man fancies the world belongs to him	645.224598384148
There you stood stammering stupefied annihilated	1295221.1971233916
One might have supposed the Bastille appeared before you and that the gigantic Medusa had converted you into stone	1131.2756385705109
Is being in love conspiring You are in love with a woman whom the cardinal has caused to be shut up and you wish to get her out of the hands of the cardinal	75.23428383750519
That s a match you are playing with his Eminence this letter is your game	531.8356812700354
Why should you expose your game to your adversary That is never done	506.28418250572616
Let him find it out if he can We can find out his	300.9317530497276
Well that s all very sensible Athos said DArtagnan	3505.206066990447
In that case let there be no more question of what s past and let Aramis resume the letter from his cousin where the cardinal interrupted him	354.1880515597341
Aramis drew the letter from his pocket the three friends surrounded him and the three lackeys grouped themselves again near the wine jar	429.9311049284124
You had only read a line or two said DArtagnan read the letter again from the commencement	273.6802735558382
MY DEAR COUSIN I think I shall make up my mind to set out for Bthune where my sister has placed our little servant in the convent of the Carmelites this poor child is quite resigned as she knows she can not live elsewhere without the salvation of her soul being in danger	173.63324212612528
Nevertheless if the affairs of our family are arranged as we hope they will be I believe she will run the risk of being damned and will return to those she regrets particularly as she knows they are always thinking of her	163.9956211920801
Meanwhile she is not very wretched what she most desires is a letter from her intended	452.83558098364136
I know that such viands pass with difficulty through convent gratings but after all as I have given you proofs my dear cousin I am not unskilled in such affairs and I will take charge of the commission	198.73635409586313
My sister thanks you for your good and eternal remembrance	463.7732786323201
She has experienced much anxiety but she is now at length a little reassured having sent her secretary away in order that nothing may happen unexpectedly	335.84700925126367
Tell us news of yourself as often as you can that is to say as often as you can with safety	113.29049738415668
Oh what do I not owe you Aramis said DArtagnan	1670.2383608635955
Dear Constance I have at length then intelligence of you	327.69229332442853
She lives she is in safety in a convent she is at Bthune Where is Bthune Athos	1697.7991476979753
Why upon the frontiers of Artois and of Flanders	1100.51071571473
The siege once over we shall be able to make a tour in that direction	40.166079790704885
And that will not be long it is to be hoped said Porthos for they have this morning hanged a spy who confessed that the Rochellais were reduced to the leather of their shoes	357.44701659966825
Supposing that after having eaten the leather they eat the soles I can not see much that is left unless they eat one another	372.14485964984675
Poor fools said Athos emptying a glass of excellent Bordeaux wine which without having at that period the reputation it now enjoys merited it no less poor fools As if the Catholic religion was not the most advantageous and the most agreeable of all religions All the same resumed he after having clicked his tongue against his palate they are brave fellows But what the devil are you about Aramis continued Athos	606.2585683473428
Why you are squeezing that letter into your pocket	282.0688967299626
Yes said DArtagnan Athos is right it must be burned	210.400797300124
And yet if we burn it who knows whether Monsieur Cardinal has not a secret to interrogate ashes	601.7353456590719
He must have one said Athos	2214.501566885879
What will you do with the letter then asked Porthos	462.99320746203205
As a punishment for having spoken without permission my friend you will please to eat this piece of paper then to recompense you for the service you will have rendered us you shall afterward drink this glass of wine	170.71917513878813
Grimaud smiled and with his eyes fixed upon the glass which Athos held in his hand he ground the paper well between his teeth and then swallowed it	86.78680633219722
Bravo Monsieur Grimaud said Athos and now take this	173.1925402311814
We dispense with your saying grace	164673.29339801613
Grimaud silently swallowed the glass of Bordeaux wine but his eyes raised toward heaven during this delicious occupation spoke a language which though mute was not the less expressive	512.4084815730348
And now said Athos unless Monsieur Cardinal should form the ingenious idea of ripping up Grimaud I think we may be pretty much at our ease respecting the letter	635.582337735965
Meantime his Eminence continued his melancholy ride murmuring between his mustaches These four men must positively be mine	3356.674910464891
Let us return to Milady whom a glance thrown upon the coast of France has made us lose sight of for an instant	161.3435441676845
We shall find her still in the despairing attitude in which we left her plunged in an abyss of dismal reflectiona dark hell at the gate of which she has almost left hope behind because for the first time she doubts for the first time she fears	344.17703609579166
On two occasions her fortune has failed her on two occasions she has found herself discovered and betrayed and on these two occasions it was to one fatal genius sent doubtlessly by the Lord to combat her that she has succumbed	497.92488484098686
DArtagnan has conquered herher that invincible power of evil	2316.6633092508646
He has deceived her in her love humbled her in her pride thwarted her in her ambition and now he ruins her fortune deprives her of liberty and even threatens her life	537.8997627883873
Still more he has lifted the corner of her maskthat shield with which she covered herself and which rendered her so strong	259.64043594499816
DArtagnan has turned aside from Buckingham whom she hates as she hates everyone she has loved the tempest with which Richelieu threatened him in the person of the queen	405.7674370348375
DArtagnan had passed himself upon her as De Wardes for whom she had conceived one of those tigerlike fancies common to women of her character	477.2154435880787
DArtagnan knows that terrible secret which she has sworn no one shall know without dying	151.72726044761563
In short at the moment in which she has just obtained from Richelieu a carte blanche by the means of which she is about to take vengeance on her enemy this precious paper is torn from her hands and it is DArtagnan who holds her prisoner and is about to send her to some filthy Botany Bay some infamous Tyburn of the Indian Ocean	424.48719415012295
All this she owes to DArtagnan without doubt	4107.86490130982
From whom can come so many disgraces heaped upon her head if not from him He alone could have transmitted to Lord de Winter all these frightful secrets which he has discovered one after another by a train of fatalities	310.4712396831121
He must have written to him	28.461253727319086
What hatred she distills Motionless with her burning and fixed glances in her solitary apartment how well the outbursts of passion which at times escape from the depths of her chest with her respiration accompany the sound of the surf which rises growls roars and breaks itself like an eternal and powerless despair against the rocks on which is built this dark and lofty castle How many magnificent projects of vengeance she conceives by the light of the flashes which her tempestuous passion casts over her mind against Mme	570.6184782535815
Bonacieux against Buckingham but above all against DArtagnanprojects lost in the distance of the future	250.05003409719654
Yes but in order to avenge herself she must be free	181.6092440355903
And to be free a prisoner has to pierce a wall detach bars cut through a floorall undertakings which a patient and strong man may accomplish but before which the feverish irritations of a woman must give way	826.9357338275106
Besides to do all this time is necessarymonths years and she has ten or twelve days as Lord de Winter her fraternal and terrible jailer has told her	533.8776474986066
And yet if she were a man she would attempt all this and perhaps might succeed why then did heaven make the mistake of placing that manlike soul in that frail and delicate body	629.8341440194237
The first moments of her captivity were terrible a few convulsions of rage which she could not suppress paid her debt of feminine weakness to nature	906.3545552545414
But by degrees she overcame the outbursts of her mad passion and nervous tremblings which agitated her frame disappeared and she remained folded within herself like a fatigued serpent in repose	640.9031418288215
Go to go to I must have been mad to allow myself to be carried away so says she gazing into the glass which reflects back to her eyes the burning glance by which she appears to interrogate herself	182.73876690040913
No violence violence is the proof of weakness	188.7078857551542
In the first place I have never succeeded by that means	62.023515008835815
Perhaps if I employed my strength against women I might perchance find them weaker than myself and consequently conquer them but it is with men that I struggle and I am but a woman to them	265.8916630452552
Let me fight like a woman then my strength is in my weakness	98.82187026440226
Then as if to render an account to herself of the changes she could place upon her countenance so mobile and so expressive she made it take all expressions from that of passionate anger which convulsed her features to that of the most sweet most affectionate and most seducing smile	428.29036471418283
Then her hair assumed successively under her skillful hands all the undulations she thought might assist the charms of her face	450.7467670385834
At length she murmured satisfied with herself Come nothing is lost I am still beautiful	365.45925817297353
It was then nearly eight oclock in the evening	5.696096645828499
Milady perceived a bed she calculated that the repose of a few hours would not only refresh her head and her ideas but still further her complexion	304.86280040384537
A better idea however came into her mind before going to bed	109.11998285900953
She had heard something said about supper	17858.503182934135
She had already been an hour in this apartment they could not long delay bringing her a repast	310.942284881172
The prisoner did not wish to lose time and she resolved to make that very evening some attempts to ascertain the nature of the ground she had to work upon by studying the characters of the men to whose guardianship she was committed	207.82902638320374
A light appeared under the door this light announced the reappearance of her jailers	575.2346710936413
Milady who had arisen threw herself quickly into the armchair her head thrown back her beautiful hair unbound and disheveled her bosom half bare beneath her crumpled lace one hand on her heart and the other hanging down	358.42673107043396
The bolts were drawn the door groaned upon its hinges	339.71537000560517
Steps sounded in the chamber and drew near	62.99098008051923
Place that table there said a voice which the prisoner recognized as that of Felton	181.30120285844276
You will bring lights and relieve the sentinel continued Felton	7069.005837706827
And this double order which the young lieutenant gave to the same individuals proved to Milady that her servants were the same men as her guards that is to say soldiers	317.45371545113056
Feltons orders were for the rest executed with a silent rapidity that gave a good idea of the way in which he maintained discipline	219.8361379255946
At length Felton who had not yet looked at Milady turned toward her	260.99420032830363
Ah ah said he she is asleep that s well	639.7603875855297
When she wakes she can sup	49038.906032061284
And he made some steps toward the door	21.45719470503915
But my lieutenant said a soldier less stoical than his chief and who had approached Milady this woman is not asleep	440.56830578986586
What not asleep said Felton what is she doing then	194.44356353708426
Her face is very pale and I have listened in vain I do not hear her breathe	94.68086507615195
You are right said Felton after having looked at Milady from the spot on which he stood without moving a step toward her	149.28087805824916
Go and tell Lord de Winter that his prisoner has faintedfor this event not having been foreseen I do nt know what to do	180.4904912028273
The soldier went out to obey the orders of his officer	105.70322064272492
Felton sat down upon an armchair which happened to be near the door and waited without speaking a word without making a gesture	102.6420588175124
Milady possessed that great art so much studied by women of looking through her long eyelashes without appearing to open the lids	535.3596633231386
She perceived Felton who sat with his back toward her	37.89272947389556
She continued to look at him for nearly ten minutes and in these ten minutes the immovable guardian never turned round once	350.2757306491005
She then thought that Lord de Winter would come and by his presence give fresh strength to her jailer	458.0725041259074
Her first trial was lost she acted like a woman who reckons up her resources	775.5225489315168
As a result she raised her head opened her eyes and sighed deeply	108.41248049386749
At this sigh Felton turned round	610.2704885367762
Ah you are awake madame he said then I have nothing more to do here	32.75852025811567
If you want anything you can ring	1573.0210700789446
Oh my God my God how I have suffered said Milady in that harmonious voice which like that of the ancient enchantresses charmed all whom she wished to destroy	228.6825449274146
And she assumed upon sitting up in the armchair a still more graceful and abandoned position than when she reclined	501.4152205590312
You will be served thus madame three times a day said he	247.87838107086478
In the morning at nine oclock in the day at one oclock and in the evening at eight	26.578041142452978
If that does not suit you you can point out what other hours you prefer and in this respect your wishes will be complied with	405.7824823842315
But am I to remain always alone in this vast and dismal chamber asked Milady	1946.5320663590317
A woman of the neighbourhood has been sent for who will be tomorrow at the castle and will return as often as you desire her presence	167.05945134784452
I thank you sir replied the prisoner humbly	2808.7472989238017
Felton made a slight bow and directed his steps toward the door	61.000015906507514
At the moment he was about to go out Lord de Winter appeared in the corridor followed by the soldier who had been sent to inform him of the swoon of Milady	108.76522010233343
He held a vial of salts in his hand	87.96496981236719
Well what is itwhat is going on here said he in a jeering voice on seeing the prisoner sitting up and Felton about to go out	132.66180072100815
Is this corpse come to life already Felton my lad did you not perceive that you were taken for a novice and that the first act was being performed of a comedy of which we shall doubtless have the pleasure of following out all the developments	240.97453361195997
I thought so my lord said Felton but as the prisoner is a woman after all I wish to pay her the attention that every man of gentle birth owes to a woman if not on her account at least on my own	124.96146810865021
Milady shuddered through her whole system	16420.2905694466
These words of Feltons passed like ice through her veins	1058.440349224681
So replied de Winter laughing that beautiful hair so skillfully disheveled that white skin and that languishing look have not yet seduced you you heart of stone	1227.907887764486
No my Lord replied the impassive young man your Lordship may be assured that it requires more than the tricks and coquetry of a woman to corrupt me	470.4761357059996
In that case my brave lieutenant let us leave Milady to find out something else and go to supper but be easy She has a fruitful imagination and the second act of the comedy will not delay its steps after the first	392.1090501738455
And at these words Lord de Winter passed his arm through that of Felton and led him out laughing	314.62358923039625
Oh I will be a match for you murmured Milady between her teeth be assured of that you poor spoiled monk you poor converted soldier who has cut his uniform out of a monks frock	978.3845898963767
By the way resumed de Winter stopping at the threshold of the door you must not Milady let this check take away your appetite	391.3113885881047
Taste that fowl and those fish	2092.996006191484
On my honor they are not poisoned	703.657393118837
I have a very good cook and he is not to be my heir I have full and perfect confidence in him	195.00747329364646
Adieu dear sister till your next swoon	16794.71227427634
This was all that Milady could endure	1484.371918383827
Her hands clutched her armchair she ground her teeth inwardly her eyes followed the motion of the door as it closed behind Lord de Winter and Felton and the moment she was alone a fresh fit of despair seized her	301.5458413768845
She cast her eyes upon the table saw the glittering of a knife rushed toward it and clutched it but her disappointment was cruel	249.56274933645
The blade was round and of flexible silver	5268.22843533903
A burst of laughter resounded from the other side of the illclosed door and the door reopened	81.78318134080102
Ha ha cried Lord de Winter ha ha Do nt you see my brave Felton do nt you see what I told you That knife was for you my lad she would have killed you	371.18780539208706
Observe this is one of her peculiarities to get rid thus after one fashion or another of all the people who bother her	1027.3983939248644
If I had listened to you the knife would have been pointed and of steel	178.92840948126914
Then no more of Felton she would have cut your throat and after that everybody elses	361.46857347517425
See John see how well she knows how to handle a knife	407.93038939833764
In fact Milady still held the harmless weapon in her clenched hand but these last words this supreme insult relaxed her hands her strength and even her will	549.1223001995381
The knife fell to the ground	18.257963399732628
You were right my Lord said Felton with a tone of profound disgust which sounded to the very bottom of the heart of Milady you were right my Lord and I was wrong	126.47149142284732
And both again left the room	5.33281322315267
But this time Milady lent a more attentive ear than the first and she heard their steps die away in the distance of the corridor	146.97403378752804
I am lost murmured she I am lost I am in the power of men upon whom I can have no more influence than upon statues of bronze or granite they know me by heart and are steeled against all my weapons	219.57361564643577
It is however impossible that this should end as they have decreed	458.1072975872444
In fact as this last reflection indicatedthis instinctive return to hopesentiments of weakness or fear did not dwell long in her ardent spirit	1355.9732171758799
Milady sat down to table ate from several dishes drank a little Spanish wine and felt all her resolution return	1569.643738304607
Before she went to bed she had pondered analyzed turned on all sides examined on all points the words the steps the gestures the signs and even the silence of her interlocutors and of this profound skillful and anxious study the result was that Felton everything considered appeared the more vulnerable of her two persecutors	752.4848169125655
One expression above all recurred to the mind of the prisoner If I had listened to you Lord de Winter had said to Felton	145.61119323449705
Felton then had spoken in her favor since Lord de Winter had not been willing to listen to him	107.11906554243618
Weak or strong repeated Milady that man has then a spark of pity in his soul of that spark I will make a flame that shall devour him	283.8000125112518
As to the other he knows me he fears me and knows what he has to expect of me if ever I escape from his hands	189.2207095246123
It is useless then to attempt anything with him	606.009629332556
He is a young ingenuous pure man who seems virtuous him there are means of destroying	1431.087156293716
And Milady went to bed and fell asleep with a smile upon her lips	32.75626855657592
Anyone who had seen her sleeping might have said she was a young girl dreaming of the crown of flowers she was to wear on her brow at the next festival	195.84859005730908
Milady dreamed that she at length had DArtagnan in her power that she was present at his execution and it was the sight of his odious blood flowing beneath the ax of the headsman which spread that charming smile upon her lips	271.52537191546674
She slept as a prisoner sleeps rocked by his first hope	3023.695565418602
In the morning when they entered her chamber she was still in bed	59.49934508800892
He brought with him the woman of whom he had spoken the evening before and who had just arrived this woman entered and approaching Miladys bed offered her services	220.64921090133885
Milady was habitually pale her complexion might therefore deceive a person who saw her for the first time	151.1511960981837
I am in a fever said she I have not slept a single instant during all this long night	104.02942838038717
Are you likely to be more humane to me than others were yesterday All I ask is permission to remain abed	717.3133659398204
Would you like to have a physician called said the woman	169.25457171450006
Felton listened to this dialogue without speaking a word	113.66329042760815
Milady reflected that the more people she had around her the more she would have to work upon and Lord de Winter would redouble his watch	432.45476866788744
Besides the physician might declare the ailment feigned and Milady after having lost the first trick was not willing to lose the second	324.99630218998715
Go and fetch a physician said she	50.74826242564392
What could be the good of that These gentlemen declared yesterday that my illness was a comedy it would be just the same today no doubtfor since yesterday evening they have had plenty of time to send for a doctor	341.8986403523716
Then said Felton who became impatient say yourself madame what treatment you wish followed	3691.912873235174
Eh how can I tell My God I know that I suffer that s all	162.78120913560238
Give me anything you like it is of little consequence	109.58020813253533
Go and fetch Lord de Winter said Felton tired of these eternal complaints	4737.27764929962
Oh no no cried Milady no sir do not call him I conjure you	101.10289606613507
I am well I want nothing do not call him	60.140859112132034
She gave so much vehemence such magnetic eloquence to this exclamation that Felton in spite of himself advanced some steps into the room	450.873346952039
Meanwhile madame if you really suffer said Felton a physician shall be sent for and if you deceive uswell it will be the worse for you	235.3989572388725
But at least we shall not have to reproach ourselves with anything	139.4566376090449
Milady made no reply but turning her beautiful head round upon her pillow she burst into tears and uttered heartbreaking sobs	287.1813594662341
Felton surveyed her for an instant with his usual impassiveness then seeing that the crisis threatened to be prolonged he went out	250.1098406608804
The woman followed him and Lord de Winter did not appear	168.28948011385538
I fancy I begin to see my way murmured Milady with a savage joy burying herself under the clothes to conceal from anybody who might be watching her this burst of inward satisfaction	631.6181037699497
Now it is time that the malady should be over said she let me rise and obtain some success this very day	335.9376467990315
I have but ten days and this evening two of them will be gone	105.60326129080413
In the morning when they entered Miladys chamber they had brought her breakfast	654.1392804361544
Now she thought they could not long delay coming to clear the table and that Felton would then reappear	1088.5823463807676
Felton reappeared and without observing whether Milady had or had not touched her repast made a sign that the table should be carried out of the room it having been brought in ready spread	271.862914312672
Felton remained behind he held a book in his hand	23.776901752943225
Milady reclining in an armchair near the chimney beautiful pale and resigned looked like a holy virgin awaiting martyrdom	1378.3647204785882
Felton approached her and said Lord de Winter who is a Catholic like yourself madame thinking that the deprivation of the rites and ceremonies of your church might be painful to you has consented that you should read every day the ordinary of your Mass and here is a book which contains the ritual	308.910546922371
At the manner in which Felton laid the book upon the little table near which Milady was sitting at the tone in which he pronounced the two words your Mass at the disdainful smile with which he accompanied them Milady raised her head and looked more attentively at the officer	290.28150193857005
By that plain arrangement of the hair by that costume of extreme simplicity by the brow polished like marble and as hard and impenetrable she recognized one of those gloomy Puritans she had so often met not only in the court of King James but in that of the King of France where in spite of the remembrance of the St	244.93734089659154
Bartholomew they sometimes came to seek refuge	4332.890104203659
She then had one of those sudden inspirations which only people of genius receive in great crises in supreme moments which are to decide their fortunes or their lives	757.6456181661986
Those two words your Mass and a simple glance cast upon Felton revealed to her all the importance of the reply she was about to make but with that rapidity of intelligence which was peculiar to her this reply ready arranged presented itself to her lips	238.84382540268606
I said she with an accent of disdain in unison with that which she had remarked in the voice of the young officer I sir My Mass Lord de Winter the corrupted Catholic knows very well that I am not of his religion and this is a snare he wishes to lay for me	264.9657168645384
And of what religion are you then madame asked Felton with an astonishment which in spite of the empire he held over himself he could not entirely conceal	138.29663688876568
I will tell it cried Milady with a feigned exultation on the day when I shall have suffered sufficiently for my faith	269.7850135812914
The look of Felton revealed to Milady the full extent of the space she had opened for herself by this single word	176.74719930318778
The young officer however remained mute and motionless his look alone had spoken	306.3571723855175
I am in the hands of my enemies continued she with that tone of enthusiasm which she knew was familiar to the Puritans	168.46945638496382
Well let my God save me or let me perish for my God That is the reply I beg you to make to Lord de Winter	138.5915797558486
And as to this book added she pointing to the manual with her finger but without touching it as if she must be contaminated by it you may carry it back and make use of it yourself for doubtless you are doubly the accomplice of Lord de Winterthe accomplice in his persecutions the accomplice in his heresies	253.35894767827915
Felton made no reply took the book with the same appearance of repugnance which he had before manifested and retired pensively	196.3504850190367
Lord de Winter came toward five oclock in the evening	29.468585450721065
Milady had had time during the whole day to trace her plan of conduct	254.97342022339942
She received him like a woman who had already recovered all her advantages	163.26835187353927
It appears said the baron seating himself in the armchair opposite that occupied by Milady and stretching out his legs carelessly upon the hearth it appears we have made a little apostasy	261.4105165382866
I mean to say that since we last met you have changed your religion	511.4838845349884
You have not by chance married a Protestant for a third husband have you	407.7946874072335
Explain yourself my Lord replied the prisoner with majesty for though I hear your words I declare I do not understand them	140.54734655547276
Then you have no religion at all I like that best replied Lord de Winter laughing	527.2005515482217
Certainly that is most in accord with your own principles replied Milady frigidly	2351.044824382623
Oh I confess it is all the same to me	33.046707635974286
Oh you need not avow this religious indifference my Lord your debaucheries and crimes would vouch for it	1670.661589277694
What you talk of debaucheries Madame Messalina Lady Macbeth Either I misunderstand you or you are very shameless	2447.5060260123746
You only speak thus because you are overheard coolly replied Milady and you wish to interest your jailers and your hangmen against me	556.9128487486776
My jailers and my hangmen Heyday madame you are taking a poetical tone and the comedy of yesterday turns to a tragedy this evening	569.2631271197454
As to the rest in eight days you will be where you ought to be and my task will be completed	94.23313284072141
Infamous task impious task cried Milady with the exultation of a victim who provokes his judge	401.09015519987537
My word said de Winter rising I think the hussy is going mad Come come calm yourself Madame Puritan or Ill remove you to a dungeon	1106.0707693329196
Its my Spanish wine that has got into your head is it not But never mind that sort of intoxication is not dangerous and will have no bad effects	245.60532332714047
And Lord de Winter retired swearing which at that period was a very knightly habit	621.1442278010634
Felton was indeed behind the door and had not lost one word of this scene	39.37779902082351
Yes go go said she to her brother the effects are drawing near on the contrary but you weak fool will not see them until it is too late to shun them	188.97239415673258
Miladys supper was brought in and she was found deeply engaged in saying her prayers aloudprayers which she had learned of an old servant of her second husband a most austere Puritan	396.674730705109
She appeared to be in ecstasy and did not pay the least attention to what was going on around her	109.48618459585936
Felton made a sign that she should not be disturbed and when all was arranged he went out quietly with the soldiers	57.6240395170256
Milady knew she might be watched so she continued her prayers to the end and it appeared to her that the soldier who was on duty at her door did not march with the same step and seemed to listen	119.37438448372276
For the moment she wished nothing better	691.4194064150653
She arose came to the table ate but little and drank only water	684.4688059395728
An hour after her table was cleared but Milady remarked that this time Felton did not accompany the soldiers	591.8756953273726
He feared then to see her too often	453.3864426803468
She turned toward the wall to smilefor there was in this smile such an expression of triumph that this smile alone would have betrayed her	163.51258076365139
She allowed therefore half an hour to pass away and as at that moment all was silence in the old castle as nothing was heard but the eternal murmur of the wavesthat immense breaking of the oceanwith her pure harmonious and powerful voice she began the first couplet of the psalm then in great favor with the Puritans	297.7850319823148
Thou leavest thy servants Lord To see if they be strong But soon thou dost afford Thy hand to lead them on	805.3449161657326
These verses were not excellentvery far from it but as it is well known the Puritans did not pique themselves upon their poetry	259.422350603207
The soldier on guard at her door stopped as if he had been changed into stone	102.92505178640704
Milady was then able to judge of the effect she had produced	199.5180628079766
Then she continued her singing with inexpressible fervor and feeling	1220.810358392856
It appeared to her that the sounds spread to a distance beneath the vaulted roofs and carried with them a magic charm to soften the hearts of her jailers	556.0846561275384
It however likewise appeared that the soldier on dutya zealous Catholic no doubtshook off the charm for through the door he called Hold your tongue madame Your song is as dismal as a De profundis and if besides the pleasure of being in garrison here we must hear such things as these no mortal can hold out	870.5399215106377
Silence then exclaimed another stern voice which Milady recognized as that of Felton	366.7520326063242
What are you meddling with stupid Did anybody order you to prevent that woman from singing No	2715.0172510454
You were told to guard herto fire at her if she attempted to fly	798.7802516302795
Guard her If she flies kill her but do nt exceed your orders	622.2062235439749
An expression of unspeakable joy lightened the countenance of Milady but this expression was fleeting as the reflection of lightning	331.82003161176704
Without appearing to have heard the dialogue of which she had not lost a word she began again giving to her voice all the charm all the power all the seduction the demon had bestowed upon it	200.3372123870439
For all my tears my cares My exile and my chains I have my youth my prayers And God who counts my pains	1714.165487873124
Her voice of immense power and sublime expression gave to the rude unpolished poetry of these psalms a magic and an effect which the most exalted Puritans rarely found in the songs of their brethren and which they were forced to ornament with all the resources of their imagination	372.2837744270582
Felton believed he heard the singing of the angel who consoled the three Hebrews in the furnace	340.43091784268154
One day our doors will ope With God come our desire And if betrays that hope To death we can aspire	4738.566603374703
This verse into which the terrible enchantress threw her whole soul completed the trouble which had seized the heart of the young officer	396.3797748122391
He opened the door quickly and Milady saw him appear pale as usual but with his eye inflamed and almost wild	289.13467001534445
Why do you sing thus and with such a voice said he	106.01343953060618
Your pardon sir said Milady with mildness	3159.9047296691556
I forgot that my songs are out of place in this castle	153.58982959601803
I have perhaps offended you in your creed but it was without wishing to do so I swear	84.21826046361545
Pardon me then a fault which is perhaps great but which certainly was involuntary	515.4200040472264
Milady was so beautiful at this moment the religious ecstasy in which she appeared to be plunged gave such an expression to her countenance that Felton was so dazzled that he fancied he beheld the angel whom he had only just before heard	135.8378989316088
Yes yes said he you disturb you agitate the people who live in the castle	349.9269701021519
The poor senseless young man was not aware of the incoherence of his words while Milady was reading with her lynxs eyes the very depths of his heart	194.76057404365469
I will be silent then said Milady casting down her eyes with all the sweetness she could give to her voice with all the resignation she could impress upon her manner	175.66843502049653
No no madame said Felton only do not sing so loud particularly at night	460.74017035752865
And at these words Felton feeling that he could not long maintain his severity toward his prisoner rushed out of the room	132.40650885583753
You have done right Lieutenant said the soldier	110.75551232486109
Such songs disturb the mind and yet we become accustomed to them her voice is so beautiful	166.87447105406716
Felton had fallen but there was still another step to be taken	84.25856767744847
He must be retained or rather he must be left quite alone and Milady but obscurely perceived the means which could lead to this result	310.3203399929271
He must be made to speak in order that he might be spoken tofor Milady very well knew that her greatest seduction was in her voice which so skillfully ran over the whole gamut of tones from human speech to language celestial	675.3912607301114
Yet in spite of all this seduction Milady might failfor Felton was forewarned and that against the least chance	1963.7785032180682
From that moment she watched all his actions all his words from the simplest glance of his eyes to his gestureseven to a breath that could be interpreted as a sigh	174.89241404120915
In short she studied everything as a skillful comedian does to whom a new part has been assigned in a line to which he is not accustomed	212.65820064674134
Face to face with Lord de Winter her plan of conduct was more easy	539.3564179820899
She had laid that down the preceding evening	936.2477789606681
To remain silent and dignified in his presence from time to time to irritate him by affected disdain by a contemptuous word to provoke him to threats and violence which would produce a contrast with her own resignationsuch was her plan	384.95407814840877
Felton would see all perhaps he would say nothing but he would see	50.45450634634266
In the morning Felton came as usual but Milady allowed him to preside over all the preparations for breakfast without addressing a word to him	414.09698610174934
At the moment when he was about to retire she was cheered with a ray of hope for she thought he was about to speak but his lips moved without any sound leaving his mouth and making a powerful effort to control himself he sent back to his heart the words that were about to escape from his lips and went out	88.45507721238627
Toward midday Lord de Winter entered	847.9492096742387
It was a tolerably fine winters day and a ray of that pale English sun which lights but does not warm came through the bars of her prison	632.6067841864461
Milady was looking out at the window and pretended not to hear the door as it opened	69.18330616217139
Ah ah said Lord de Winter after having played comedy after having played tragedy we are now playing melancholy	2226.0207972025573
Yes yes continued Lord de Winter I understand	405.3554104693965
You would like very well to be at liberty on that beach You would like very well to be in a good ship dancing upon the waves of that emeraldgreen sea you would like very well either on land or on the ocean to lay for me one of those nice little ambuscades you are so skillful in planning	352.953618850136
Patience patience In four days time the shore will be beneath your feet the sea will be open to youmore open than will perhaps be agreeable to you for in four days England will be relieved of you	320.8935045155167
Milady folded her hands and raising her fine eyes toward heaven Lord Lord said she with an angelic meekness of gesture and tone pardon this man as I myself pardon him	556.8413195631774
Yes pray accursed woman cried the baron your prayer is so much the more generous from your being I swear to you in the power of a man who will never pardon you and he went out	73.6621328380191
At the moment he went out a piercing glance darted through the opening of the nearly closed door and she perceived Felton who drew quickly to one side to prevent being seen by her	202.08613914131635
Then she threw herself upon her knees and began to pray	36.34229240661211
My God my God said she thou knowest in what holy cause I suffer give me then strength to suffer	886.1412766612476
The door opened gently the beautiful supplicant pretended not to hear the noise and in a voice broken by tears she continued	215.88865627078874
God of vengeance God of goodness wilt thou allow the frightful projects of this man to be accomplished	341.1533800167183
Then only she pretended to hear the sound of Feltons steps and rising quick as thought she blushed as if ashamed of being surprised on her knees	309.7106748682822
I do not like to disturb those who pray madame said Felton seriously do not disturb yourself on my account I beseech you	159.56370393822797
How do you know I was praying sir said Milady in a voice broken by sobs	272.05307695029916
You were deceived sir I was not praying	282.7353503431171
Do you think then madame replied Felton in the same serious voice but with a milder tone do you think I assume the right of preventing a creature from prostrating herself before her Creator God forbid Besides repentance becomes the guilty whatever crimes they may have committed for me the guilty are sacred at the feet of God	452.91498400404976
Guilty I said Milady with a smile which might have disarmed the angel of the last judgment	91.97860813287127
Guilty Oh my God thou knowest whether I am guilty Say I am condemned sir if you please but you know that God who loves martyrs sometimes permits the innocent to be condemned	323.95143355024913
Were you condemned were you innocent were you a martyr replied Felton the greater would be the necessity for prayer and I myself would aid you with my prayers	509.2514440564913
Oh you are a just man cried Milady throwing herself at his feet	261.72279914920256
I can hold out no longer for I fear I shall be wanting in strength at the moment when I shall be forced to undergo the struggle and confess my faith	126.44887352745711
Listen then to the supplication of a despairing woman	113.03812129334354
You are abused sir but that is not the question	29.433649545003675
I only ask you one favor and if you grant it me I will bless you in this world and in the next	65.12631491581563
Speak to the master madame said Felton happily I am neither charged with the power of pardoning nor punishing	826.3035589866117
It is upon one higher placed than I am that God has laid this responsibility	288.46671348509045
To youno to you alone Listen to me rather than add to my destruction rather than add to my ignominy	817.9822022414495
If you have merited this shame madame if you have incurred this ignominy you must submit to it as an offering to God	312.1145500676406
What do you say Oh you do not understand me When I speak of ignominy you think I speak of some chastisement of imprisonment or death	185.7333597404332
Would to heaven Of what consequence to me is imprisonment or death	1088.953076470837
It is I who no longer understand you madame said Felton	380.514145714588
Or rather who pretend not to understand me sir replied the prisoner with a smile of incredulity	41.80836942393526
No madame on the honor of a soldier on the faith of a Christian	42.40148137541114
What you are ignorant of Lord de Winters designs upon me	1238.2990896477793
Oh he conceals them too little for you not to divine them	205.4317107998423
I seek to divine nothing madame I wait till I am confided in and apart from that which Lord de Winter has said to me before you he has confided nothing to me	138.58978876857992
Why then cried Milady with an incredible tone of truthfulness you are not his accomplice you do not know that he destines me to a disgrace which all the punishments of the world can not equal in horror	170.81118725090158
You are deceived madame said Felton blushing Lord de Winter is not capable of such a crime	852.7954674684272
Good said Milady to herself without thinking what it is he calls it a crime Then aloud The friend of that wretch is capable of everything	375.5353598366645
Whom do you call that wretch asked Felton	7810.785465787347
Are there then in England two men to whom such an epithet can be applied	468.0029493515
You mean George Villiers asked Felton whose looks became excited	9035.265865909543
Whom Pagans and unbelieving Gentiles call Duke of Buckingham replied Milady	2880.498252204952
I could not have thought that there was an Englishman in all England who would have required so long an explanation to make him understand of whom I was speaking	92.12512540472058
The hand of the Lord is stretched over him said Felton he will not escape the chastisement he deserves	661.513148637363
Felton only expressed with regard to the duke the feeling of execration which all the English had declared toward him whom the Catholics themselves called the extortioner the pillager the debauchee and whom the Puritans styled simply Satan	789.1136859072757
Oh my God my God cried Milady when I supplicate thee to pour upon this man the chastisement which is his due thou knowest it is not my own vengeance I pursue but the deliverance of a whole nation that I implore	530.1272170179365
Do you know him then asked Felton	6769.237292384117
At length he interrogates me said Milady to herself at the height of joy at having obtained so quickly such a great result	352.5472670019975
Oh know him Yes yes to my misfortune to my eternal misfortune and Milady twisted her arms as if in a paroxysm of grief	284.26140360992656
Felton no doubt felt within himself that his strength was abandoning him and he made several steps toward the door but the prisoner whose eye never left him sprang in pursuit of him and stopped him	124.44453595576788
Sir cried she be kind be clement listen to my prayer That knife which the fatal prudence of the baron deprived me of because he knows the use I would make of it Oh hear me to the end that knife give it to me for a minute only for mercys for pitys sake I will embrace your knees You shall shut the door that you may be certain I contemplate no injury to you My God to youthe only just good and compassionate being I have met with To youmy preserver perhaps One minute that knife one minute a single minute and I will restore it to you through the grating of the door	394.0964174035498
Felton and you will have saved my honor	108.2541668743288
To kill yourself cried Felton with terror forgetting to withdraw his hands from the hands of the prisoner to kill yourself	87.1407279833143
I have told sir murmured Milady lowering her voice and allowing herself to sink overpowered to the ground I have told my secret He knows all My God I am lost	428.0296816584032
Felton remained standing motionless and undecided	101514.50387599858
He still doubts thought Milady I have not been earnest enough	123.74600101993424
Someone was heard in the corridor Milady recognized the step of Lord de Winter	570.7819907619132
Felton recognized it also and made a step toward the door	53.474128054592775
Oh not a word said she in a concentrated voice not a word of all that I have said to you to this man or I am lost and it would be youyou	62.912415438670564
Then as the steps drew near she became silent for fear of being heard applying with a gesture of infinite terror her beautiful hand to Feltons mouth	319.3425476702013
Felton gently repulsed Milady and she sank into a chair	37.256829095214066
Lord de Winter passed before the door without stopping and they heard the noise of his footsteps soon die away	82.60912574287033
Felton as pale as death remained some instants with his ear bent and listening then when the sound was quite extinct he breathed like a man awaking from a dream and rushed out of the apartment	160.01630361388783
Ah said Milady listening in her turn to the noise of Feltons steps which withdrew in a direction opposite to those of Lord de Winter at length you are mine	151.53600697405804
If he tells the baron said she I am lostfor the baron who knows very well that I shall not kill myself will place me before him with a knife in my hand and he will discover that all this despair is but acted	120.6612403102004
She placed herself before the glass and regarded herself attentively never had she appeared more beautiful	588.3616769489297
Oh yes said she smiling but we wo nt tell him	134.12095738799627
In the evening Lord de Winter accompanied the supper	643.2029009038599
Sir said Milady is your presence an indispensable accessory of my captivity Could you not spare me the increase of torture which your visits cause me	634.4064989256423
How dear sister said Lord de Winter	1146.715162336153
Did not you sentimentally inform me with that pretty mouth of yours so cruel to me today that you came to England solely for the pleasure of seeing me at your ease an enjoyment of which you told me you so sensibly felt the deprivation that you had risked everything for itseasickness tempest captivity Well here I am be satisfied	279.25280457042487
Besides this time my visit has a motive	234.41059209888928
Milady trembled she thought Felton had told all	287.36917528366035
Perhaps never in her life had this woman who had experienced so many opposite and powerful emotions felt her heart beat so violently	137.8945204778856
Lord de Winter took a chair drew it toward her and sat down close beside her	303.65118654966636
Then taking a paper out of his pocket he unfolded it slowly	196.3921096499368
Here said he I want to show you the kind of passport which I have drawn up and which will serve you henceforward as the rule of order in the life I consent to leave you	134.41242015855659
Then turning his eyes from Milady to the paper he read Order to conduct The name is blank interrupted Lord de Winter	1480.1067748197006
If you have any preference you can point it out to me and if it be not within a thousand leagues of London attention will be paid to your wishes	165.33563070285587
Order to conduct tothe person named Charlotte Backson branded by the justice of the kingdom of France but liberated after chastisement	899.7945656191254
She is to dwell in this place without ever going more than three leagues from it	153.57564634241905
In case of any attempt to escape the penalty of death is to be applied	84.68690820736329
She will receive five shillings per day for lodging and food	1284.3908625468132
That order does not concern me replied Milady coldly since it bears another name than mine	875.6683244296331
A name Have you a name then	148.2092371777647
I bear that of your brother	89.8827094760506
My brother is only your second husband and your first is still living	276.05400808827494
Tell me his name and I will put it in the place of the name of Charlotte Backson	74.6522889661902
No You will not You are silent Well then you must be registered as Charlotte Backson	778.2736021709848
Milady remained silent only this time it was no longer from affectation but from terror	257.1555827414639
She believed the order ready for execution	1544.885030966684
She thought that Lord de Winter had hastened her departure she thought she was condemned to set off that very evening	330.12150006048876
Everything in her mind was lost for an instant when all at once she perceived that no signature was attached to the order	155.8934161317765
The joy she felt at this discovery was so great she could not conceal it	121.79115830348736
Yes yes said Lord de Winter who perceived what was passing in her mind yes you look for the signature and you say to yourself All is not lost for that order is not signed	157.43901268544167
It is only shown to me to terrify me that s all	135.73430938913336
Tomorrow this order will be sent to the Duke of Buckingham	55.50347102345483
The day after tomorrow it will return signed by his hand and marked with his seal and fourandtwenty hours afterward I will answer for its being carried into execution	269.3364608875202
That is all I had to say to you	26.41869102528128
And I reply to you sir that this abuse of power this exile under a fictitious name are infamous	788.7912421449911
Would you like better to be hanged in your true name Milady You know that the English laws are inexorable on the abuse of marriage	364.35023445592464
Although my name or rather that of my brother would be mixed up with the affair I will risk the scandal of a public trial to make myself certain of getting rid of you	137.27880067718903
Milady made no reply but became as pale as a corpse	70.97359566546174
Oh I see you prefer peregrination	1996123.648108029
That s well madame and there is an old proverb that says Traveling trains youth	1842.648731441693
My faith you are not wrong after all and life is sweet	509.13070717326275
That s the reason why I take such care you shall not deprive me of mine	83.04873651921837
There only remains then the question of the five shillings to be settled	297.8758194514481
You think me rather parsimonious do nt you That s because I do nt care to leave you the means of corrupting your jailers	239.5798590413159
Besides you will always have your charms left to seduce them with	822.6759582282641
Employ them if your check with regard to Felton has not disgusted you with attempts of that kind	381.1045055635221
Felton has not told him said Milady to herself	1869.9927943066116
And now madame till I see you again Tomorrow I will come and announce to you the departure of my messenger	112.23383382292931
Lord de Winter rose saluted her ironically and went out	175.19315710189363
She had still four days before her	36.77813749258781
Four days would quite suffice to complete the seduction of Felton	636.0451082281194
A terrible idea however rushed into her mind	89.3237819439159
She thought that Lord de Winter would perhaps send Felton himself to get the order signed by the Duke of Buckingham	489.8765854916504
In that case Felton would escape herfor in order to secure success the magic of a continuous seduction was necessary	870.019354288348
Nevertheless as we have said one circumstance reassured her	2312.8343727224506
As she would not appear to be agitated by the threats of Lord de Winter she placed herself at the table and ate	103.93324664733478
Then as she had done the evening before she fell on her knees and repeated her prayers aloud	72.68594348585064
As on the evening before the soldier stopped his march to listen to her	179.5431664333742
Soon after she heard lighter steps than those of the sentinel which came from the end of the corridor and stopped before her door	79.1255444206811
And she began the same religious chant which had so strongly excited Felton the evening before	948.5384816768386
But although her voicesweet full and sonorousvibrated as harmoniously and as affectingly as ever the door remained shut	736.9611277714989
It appeared however to Milady that in one of the furtive glances she darted from time to time at the grating of the door she thought she saw the ardent eyes of the young man through the narrow opening	76.0359366294287
But whether this was reality or vision he had this time sufficient selfcommand not to enter	663.2431928904624
However a few instants after she had finished her religious song Milady thought she heard a profound sigh	620.2811524016291
Then the same steps she had heard approach slowly withdrew as if with regret	595.483014535887
The next day when Felton entered Miladys apartment he found her standing mounted upon a chair holding in her hands a cord made by means of torn cambric handkerchiefs twisted into a kind of rope one with another and tied at the ends	379.7171939353179
At the noise Felton made in entering Milady leaped lightly to the ground and tried to conceal behind her the improvised cord she held in her hand	226.37909732559496
The young man was more pale than usual and his eyes reddened by want of sleep denoted that he had passed a feverish night	169.1199234135777
Nevertheless his brow was armed with a severity more austere than ever	192.05923422552357
He advanced slowly toward Milady who had seated herself and taking an end of the murderous rope which by neglect or perhaps by design she allowed to be seen What is this madame he asked coldly	208.62826052160952
That Nothing said Milady smiling with that painful expression which she knew so well how to give to her smile	114.49798419986445
Ennui is the mortal enemy of prisoners I had ennui and I amused myself with twisting that rope	973.4873860876914
Felton turned his eyes toward the part of the wall of the apartment before which he had found Milady standing in the armchair in which she was now seated and over her head he perceived a giltheaded screw fixed in the wall for the purpose of hanging up clothes or weapons	147.46488434497496
He started and the prisoner saw that startfor though her eyes were cast down nothing escaped her	484.9179541582355
What were you doing on that armchair asked he	345.86737365914877
But replied Felton I wish to know	12.12360502594599
Do not question me said the prisoner you know that we who are true Christians are forbidden to lie	251.69249311228364
Well then said Felton I will tell you what you were doing or rather what you meant to do you were going to complete the fatal project you cherish in your mind	93.27301179675118
Remember madame if our God forbids falsehood he much more severely condemns suicide	20450.456373638885
When God sees one of his creatures persecuted unjustly placed between suicide and dishonor believe me sir replied Milady in a tone of deep conviction God pardons suicide for then suicide becomes martyrdom	1609.4645796299353
You say either too much or too little speak madame	812.676885122562
In the name of heaven explain yourself	13687.517157856491
That I may relate my misfortunes for you to treat them as fables that I may tell you my projects for you to go and betray them to my persecutor No sir	176.89547936519287
Besides of what importance to you is the life or death of a condemned wretch You are only responsible for my body is it not so And provided you produce a carcass that may be recognized as mine they will require no more of you nay perhaps you will even have a double reward	212.00593014446602
You suppose that I would ever accept the price of your life Oh you can not believe what you say	76.35181374222431
Let me act as I please Felton let me act as I please said Milady elated	1242.0234629042714
Every soldier must be ambitious must he not You are a lieutenant Well you will follow me to the grave with the rank of captain	167.05346165917504
What have I then done to you said Felton much agitated that you should load me with such a responsibility before God and before men In a few days you will be away from this place your life madame will then no longer be under my care and added he with a sigh then you can do what you will with it	140.7338004579658
So cried Milady as if she could not resist giving utterance to a holy indignation you a pious man you who are called a just man you ask but one thingand that is that you may not be inculpated annoyed by my death	300.00475150773804
It is my duty to watch over your life madame and I will watch	135.24665705712118
But do you understand the mission you are fulfilling Cruel enough if I am guilty but what name can you give it what name will the Lord give it if I am innocent	295.01473754348086
I am a soldier madame and fulfill the orders I have received	191.08127560348603
Do you believe then that at the day of the Last Judgment God will separate blind executioners from iniquitous judges You are not willing that I should kill my body and you make yourself the agent of him who would kill my soul	283.9736194024652
But I repeat it again to you replied Felton in great emotion no danger threatens you I will answer for Lord de Winter as for myself	416.436202439858
Dunce cried Milady dunce who dares to answer for another man when the wisest when those most after Gods own heart hesitate to answer for themselves and who ranges himself on the side of the strongest and the most fortunate to crush the weakest and the most unfortunate	361.2725275175012
Impossible madame impossible murmured Felton who felt to the bottom of his heart the justness of this argument	88.76105009783042
A prisoner you will not recover your liberty through me living you will not lose your life through me	188.8688545643775
Yes cried Milady but I shall lose that which is much dearer to me than life I shall lose my honor Felton and it is you you whom I make responsible before God and before men for my shame and my infamy	198.71659909395473
This time Felton immovable as he was or appeared to be could not resist the secret influence which had already taken possession of him	82.87424584042375
To see this woman so beautiful fair as the brightest vision to see her by turns overcome with grief and threatening to resist at once the ascendancy of grief and beautyit was too much for a visionary it was too much for a brain weakened by the ardent dreams of an ecstatic faith it was too much for a heart furrowed by the love of heaven that burns by the hatred of men that devours	293.7852425061866
She felt by intuition the flame of the opposing passions which burned with the blood in the veins of the young fanatic	198.21204035699864
As a skillful general seeing the enemy ready to surrender marches toward him with a cry of victory she rose beautiful as an antique priestess inspired like a Christian virgin her arms extended her throat uncovered her hair disheveled holding with one hand her robe modestly drawn over her breast her look illumined by that fire which had already created such disorder in the veins of the young Puritan and went toward him crying out with a vehement air and in her melodious voice to which on this occasion she communicated a terrible energy	462.8399025339339
Let this victim to Baal be sent To the lions the martyr be thrown Thy God shall teach thee to repent From th abyss hell give ear to my moan	4866.452011936282
Felton stood before this strange apparition like one petrified	1746.9267236904245
Who art thou Who art thou cried he clasping his hands	69.35416772357907
Art thou a messenger from God art thou a minister from hell art thou an angel or a demon callest thou thyself Eloa or Astarte	6348.967393185412
Do you not know me Felton I am neither an angel nor a demon I am a daughter of earth I am a sister of thy faith that is all	199.99173640243586
Yes yes said Felton I doubted but now I believe	199.9981153680955
You believe and still you are an accomplice of that child of Belial who is called Lord de Winter You believe and yet you leave me in the hands of mine enemies of the enemy of England of the enemy of God You believe and yet you deliver me up to him who fills and defiles the world with his heresies and debaucheriesto that infamous Sardanapalus whom the blind call the Duke of Buckingham and whom believers name Antichrist	298.7509662092302
I deliver you up to Buckingham I what mean you by that	862.8760071866523
They have eyes cried Milady but they see not ears have they but they hear not	412.5377719252964
Yes yes said Felton passing his hands over his brow covered with sweat as if to remove his last doubt	60.7915579775051
Yes I recognize the voice which speaks to me in my dreams yes I recognize the features of the angel who appears to me every night crying to my soul which can not sleep Strike save England save thyselffor thou wilt die without having appeased God Speak speak cried Felton I can understand you now	478.14723477743064
A flash of terrible joy but rapid as thought gleamed from the eyes of Milady	623.0356086930501
However fugitive this homicide flash Felton saw it and started as if its light had revealed the abysses of this womans heart	347.76802176331904
He recalled all at once the warnings of Lord de Winter the seductions of Milady her first attempts after her arrival	559.3394248636085
He drew back a step and hung down his head without however ceasing to look at her as if fascinated by this strange creature he could not detach his eyes from her eyes	102.25494857050859
Milady was not a woman to misunderstand the meaning of this hesitation	257.56193072738444
Under her apparent emotions her icy coolness never abandoned her	5444.014015882496
Before Felton replied and before she should be forced to resume this conversation so difficult to be sustained in the same exalted tone she let her hands fall and as if the weakness of the woman overpowered the enthusiasm of the inspired fanatic she said But no it is not for me to be the Judith to deliver Bethulia from this Holofernes	200.95911669633938
The sword of the eternal is too heavy for my arm	150.31859723087987
Allow me then to avoid dishonor by death let me take refuge in martyrdom	946.2523234496613
I do not ask you for liberty as a guilty one would nor for vengeance as would a pagan	581.2220838100953
Let me die that is all	64.92408908026837
I supplicate you I implore you on my kneeslet me die and my last sigh shall be a blessing for my preserver	269.51895493282603
Hearing that voice so sweet and suppliant seeing that look so timid and downcast Felton reproached himself	1843.6575253428364
By degrees the enchantress had clothed herself with that magic adornment which she assumed and threw aside at will that is to say beauty meekness and tearsand above all the irresistible attraction of mystical voluptuousness the most devouring of all voluptuousness	1001.4625378282309
Alas said Felton I can do but one thing which is to pity you if you prove to me you are a victim But Lord de Winter makes cruel accusations against you	211.5011777991269
You are a Christian you are my sister in religion	236.11177819689775
I feel myself drawn toward youI who have never loved anyone but my benefactorI who have met with nothing but traitors and impious men	382.59235450184633
But you madame so beautiful in reality you so pure in appearance must have committed great iniquities for Lord de Winter to pursue you thus	520.4544712679467
They have eyes repeated Milady with an accent of indescribable grief but they see not ears have they but they hear not	201.31565610560494
But cried the young officer speak then speak	1697.6668212838906
Confide my shame to you cried Milady with the blush of modesty upon her countenance for often the crime of one becomes the shame of anotherconfide my shame to you a man and I a woman Oh continued she placing her hand modestly over her beautiful eyes never neverI could not	404.56370723748097
To me to a brother said Felton	5493.293712874237
Milady looked at him for some time with an expression which the young man took for doubt but which however was nothing but observation or rather the wish to fascinate	143.32297170060133
Felton in his turn a suppliant clasped his hands	822.4873340196683
Well then said Milady I confide in my brother I will dare to	191.96106570605775
At this moment the steps of Lord de Winter were heard but this time the terrible brotherinlaw of Milady did not content himself as on the preceding day with passing before the door and going away again	196.26262530740186
He paused exchanged two words with the sentinel then the door opened and he appeared	30.344679944409407
During the exchange of these two words Felton drew back quickly and when Lord de Winter entered he was several paces from the prisoner	364.65134805835334
The baron entered slowly sending a scrutinizing glance from Milady to the young officer	331.807468414892
You have been here a very long time John said he	471.962292952382
Has this woman been relating her crimes to you In that case I can comprehend the length of the conversation	99.6001700663958
Felton started and Milady felt she was lost if she did not come to the assistance of the disconcerted Puritan	110.11004068902221
Ah you fear your prisoner should escape said she	416.2708245978126
Well ask your worthy jailer what favor I this instant solicited of him	1378.5404008151452
You demanded a favor said the baron suspiciously	3070.1866899796637
Yes my Lord replied the young man confused	91.12886313051547
And what favor pray asked Lord de Winter	806.8891377927754
A knife which she would return to me through the grating of the door a minute after she had received it replied Felton	149.43340547836652
There is someone then concealed here whose throat this amiable lady is desirous of cutting said de Winter in an ironical contemptuous tone	965.8913290750598
I have given you the choice between America and Tyburn replied Lord de Winter	2550.904514181023
Believe me the cord is more certain than the knife	226.53474670085484
Felton grew pale and made a step forward remembering that at the moment he entered Milady had a rope in her hand	202.41329296493535
You are right said she I have often thought of it	35.97373122755977
Then she added in a low voice And I will think of it again	31.224565701622563
Felton felt a shudder run to the marrow of his bones probably Lord de Winter perceived this emotion	931.9287709352777
I have placed reliance upon you my friend	31.440771126399046
Beware I have warned you But be of good courage my lad in three days we shall be delivered from this creature and where I shall send her she can harm nobody	446.3123792401843
You hear him cried Milady with vehemence so that the baron might believe she was addressing heaven and that Felton might understand she was addressing him	439.59486054231246
Felton lowered his head and reflected	1459.1178369076715
The baron took the young officer by the arm and turned his head over his shoulder so as not to lose sight of Milady till he was gone out	84.61185926968118
Well said the prisoner when the door was shut I am not so far advanced as I believed	84.24776544788875
De Winter has changed his usual stupidity into a strange prudence	1144.6936856108923
It is the desire of vengeance and how desire molds a man As to Felton he hesitates	2777.7308593065914
Ah he is not a man like that cursed DArtagnan	985.477172751699
A Puritan only adores virgins and he adores them by clasping his hands	250.84583616253116
A Musketeer loves women and he loves them by clasping his arms round them	256.6947892999589
Milady waited then with much impatience for she feared the day would pass away without her seeing Felton again	353.95686642568234
At last in an hour after the scene we have just described she heard someone speaking in a low voice at the door	45.14227191916524
Presently the door opened and she perceived Felton	6616.9468943939055
The young man advanced rapidly into the chamber leaving the door open behind him and making a sign to Milady to be silent his face was much agitated	75.5256050146761
What do you want with me said she	25.33906836763571
Listen replied Felton in a low voice	3.0362293973065184
I have just sent away the sentinel that I might remain here without anybody knowing it in order to speak to you without being overheard	133.26120066716697
The baron has just related a frightful story to me	128.91195697527453
Milady assumed her smile of a resigned victim and shook her head	233.49157962481524
Either you are a demon continued Felton or the baronmy benefactor my fatheris a monster	4608.600923518808
I have known you four days I have loved him four years	58.28144699743865
I therefore may hesitate between you	9.942255811056626
Be not alarmed at what I say I want to be convinced	38.68921062508236
Tonight after twelve I will come and see you and you shall convince me	56.31296784893682
No Felton no my brother said she the sacrifice is too great and I feel what it must cost you	92.3665472775431
No I am lost do not be lost with me	35.97119972943215
My death will be much more eloquent than my life and the silence of the corpse will convince you much better than the words of the prisoner	92.64981814485459
Be silent madame cried Felton and do not speak to me thus I came to entreat you to promise me upon your honor to swear to me by what you hold most sacred that you will make no attempt upon your life	83.80806453665836
I will not promise said Milady for no one has more respect for a promise or an oath than I have and if I make a promise I must keep it	128.78475380062622
Well said Felton only promise till you have seen me again	58.258325372192544
If when you have seen me again you still persistwell then you shall be free and I myself will give you the weapon you desire	99.52676731287113
Well said Milady for you I will wait	48.503169635586225
I swear it by our God	1688.043484254588
And he darted out of the room shut the door and waited in the corridor the soldiers halfpike in his hand and as if he had mounted guard in his place	63.680113562813915
The soldier returned and Felton gave him back his weapon	113.15434863301331
Then through the grating to which she had drawn near Milady saw the young man make a sign with delirious fervor and depart in an apparent transport of joy	378.59329796058216
As for her she returned to her place with a smile of savage contempt upon her lips and repeated blaspheming that terrible name of God by whom she had just sworn without ever having learned to know Him	212.40485295044184
My God said she what a senseless fanatic My God it is IIand this fellow who will help me to avenge myself	433.07113277790256
Milady had however achieved a halftriumph and success doubled her forces	9727.559066715252
It was not difficult to conquer as she had hitherto done men prompt to let themselves be seduced and whom the gallant education of a court led quickly into her net	862.2168780464128
Milady was handsome enough not to find much resistance on the part of the flesh and she was sufficiently skillful to prevail over all the obstacles of the mind	200.13852511771603
But this time she had to contend with an unpolished nature concentrated and insensible by force of austerity	1060.9751947154105
Religion and its observances had made Felton a man inaccessible to ordinary seductions	3562.3639048380846
There fermented in that sublimated brain plans so vast projects so tumultuous that there remained no room for any capricious or material lovethat sentiment which is fed by leisure and grows with corruption	1610.7328060965501
Milady had then made a breach by her false virtue in the opinion of a man horribly prejudiced against her and by her beauty in the heart of a man hitherto chaste and pure	292.12764072780544
In short she had taken the measure of motives hitherto unknown to herself through this experiment made upon the most rebellious subject that nature and religion could submit to her study	623.4860538943263
Many a time nevertheless during the evening she despaired of fate and of herself	741.5282082556477
She did not invoke God we very well know but she had faith in the genius of evilthat immense sovereignty which reigns in all the details of human life and by which as in the Arabian fable a single pomegranate seed is sufficient to reconstruct a ruined world	453.0082318699951
Milady being well prepared for the reception of Felton was able to erect her batteries for the next day	225.73334114734593
She knew she had only two days left that when once the order was signed by Buckinghamand Buckingham would sign it the more readily from its bearing a false name and he could not therefore recognize the woman in questiononce this order was signed we say the baron would make her embark immediately and she knew very well that women condemned to exile employ arms much less powerful in their seductions than the pretendedly virtuous woman whose beauty is lighted by the sun of the world whose style the voice of fashion lauds and whom a halo of aristocracy gilds with enchanting splendors	614.4766340382106
To be a woman condemned to a painful and disgraceful punishment is no impediment to beauty but it is an obstacle to the recovery of power	414.780766057759
Like all persons of real genius Milady knew what suited her nature and her means	1092.0478350816836
Poverty was repugnant to her degradation took away twothirds of her greatness	2416.04805718927
Milady was only a queen while among queens	13562.433327054898
The pleasure of satisfied pride was necessary to her domination	445.656577491
To command inferior beings was rather a humiliation than a pleasure for her	242.04326468975682
She should certainly return from her exileshe did not doubt that a single instant but how long might this exile last For an active ambitious nature like that of Milady days not spent in climbing are inauspicious days	1397.5790814264847
What word then can be found to describe the days which they occupy in descending To lose a year two years three years is to talk of an eternity to return after the death or disgrace of the cardinal perhaps to return when DArtagnan and his friends happy and triumphant should have received from the queen the reward they had well acquired by the services they had rendered herthese were devouring ideas that a woman like Milady could not endure	386.50260942314463
For the rest the storm which raged within her doubled her strength and she would have burst the walls of her prison if her body had been able to take for a single instant the proportions of her mind	152.63992594787717
Then that which spurred her on additionally in the midst of all this was the remembrance of the cardinal	89.34068756835109
What must the mistrustful restless suspicious cardinal think of her silencethe cardinal not merely her only support her only prop her only protector at present but still further the principal instrument of her future fortune and vengeance She knew him she knew that at her return from a fruitless journey it would be in vain to tell him of her imprisonment in vain to enlarge upon the sufferings she had undergone	479.3561990413527
The cardinal would reply with the sarcastic calmness of the skeptic strong at once by power and genius You should not have allowed yourself to be taken	261.54393057294794
Then Milady collected all her energies murmuring in the depths of her soul the name of Feltonthe only beam of light that penetrated to her in the hell into which she had fallen and like a serpent which folds and unfolds its rings to ascertain its strength she enveloped Felton beforehand in the thousand meshes of her inventive imagination	585.4622162136634
Time however passed away the hours one after another seemed to awaken the clock as they passed and every blow of the brass hammer resounded upon the heart of the prisoner	196.13363415320896
At nine oclock Lord de Winter made his customary visit examined the window and the bars sounded the floor and the walls looked to the chimney and the doors without during this long and minute examination he or Milady pronouncing a single word	439.1459390644189
Doubtless both of them understood that the situation had become too serious to lose time in useless words and aimless wrath	382.680777517274
Well said the baron on leaving her you will not escape tonight	164.51670002491667
At ten oclock Felton came and placed the sentinel	209.20986637562106
She was as well acquainted with it now as a mistress is with that of the lover of her heart and yet Milady at the same time detested and despised this weak fanatic	236.63644238908904
That was not the appointed hour	1408.3606888320462
Two hours after as midnight sounded the sentinel was relieved	1126.431209573544
This time it was the hour and from this moment Milady waited with impatience	406.06386214579106
The new sentinel commenced his walk in the corridor	152.94736593435846
At the expiration of ten minutes Felton came	1305.9327328759503
Listen said the young man to the sentinel	184.53495861801656
On no pretense leave the door for you know that last night my Lord punished a soldier for having quit his post for an instant although I during his absence watched in his place	278.9482212194044
Yes I know it said the soldier	241.49884392286035
I recommend you therefore to keep the strictest watch	569.6486106247067
For my part I am going to pay a second visit to this woman who I fear entertains sinister intentions upon her own life and I have received orders to watch her	157.4554337989233
Good murmured Milady the austere Puritan lies	33636.91559384453
As to the soldier he only smiled	2185.436598416633
Zounds Lieutenant said he you are not unlucky in being charged with such commissions particularly if my Lord has authorized you to look into her bed	417.4825485502123
Under any other circumstances he would have reprimanded the soldier for indulging in such pleasantry but his conscience murmured too loud for his mouth to dare speak	505.44852045411017
If I call come said he	12.322565448304841
I will Lieutenant said the soldier	22511.48647017777
I promised to come said Felton and I have come	205.134293715939
What my God said the young man who in spite of his selfcommand felt his knees tremble and the sweat start from his brow	78.70238504240135
You promised to bring a knife and to leave it with me after our interview	166.40381546153407
Say no more of that madame said Felton	3185.8516125770557
There is no situation however terrible it may be which can authorize a creature of God to inflict death upon himself	494.99767788162967
I have reflected and I can not must not be guilty of such a sin	138.6549936513771
Ah you have reflected said the prisoner sitting down in her armchair with a smile of disdain and I also have reflected	67.05956056824564
That I can have nothing to say to a man who does not keep his word	31.97170620627199
Here is the knife said Felton drawing from his pocket the weapon which he had brought according to his promise but which he hesitated to give to his prisoner	107.0923536798854
Let me see it said Milady	841262.6418748953
Upon my honor I will instantly return it to you	315.1721031400802
You shall place it on that table and you may remain between it and me	118.20454075755814
Felton offered the weapon to Milady who examined the temper of it attentively and who tried the point on the tip of her finger	171.5601106950663
Well said she returning the knife to the young officer this is fine and good steel	606.9285405506674
You are a faithful friend Felton	1069765.2919956665
Felton took back the weapon and laid it upon the table as he had agreed with the prisoner	75.77745871115035
Milady followed him with her eyes and made a gesture of satisfaction	56.526256750760034
Now said she listen to me	12.71027664027276
The young officer stood upright before her awaiting her words as if to devour them	250.66690346934993
Felton said Milady with a solemnity full of melancholy imagine that your sister the daughter of your father speaks to you	142.28468280032942
While yet young unfortunately handsome I was dragged into a snare	221.1389580616944
Ambushes and violences multiplied around me but I resisted	313.23127168998735
The religion I serve the God I adore were blasphemed because I called upon that religion and that God but still I resisted	979.2214568551648
Then outrages were heaped upon me and as my soul was not subdued they wished to defile my body forever	418.84453681281855
Milady stopped and a bitter smile passed over her lips	30.50369428127935
Finally said Felton finally what did they do	107.21157415397555
At length one evening my enemy resolved to paralyze the resistance he could not conquer	509.80071750641815
One evening he mixed a powerful narcotic with my water	1001.913469076112
Scarcely had I finished my repast when I felt myself sink by degrees into a strange torpor	617.322228262116
Although I was without mistrust a vague fear seized me and I tried to struggle against sleepiness	574.5179610681023
I wished to run to the window and call for help but my legs refused their office	176.4121540443744
It appeared as if the ceiling sank upon my head and crushed me with its weight	244.48975946539557
I could only utter inarticulate sounds and irresistible faintness came over me	1525.7488600621775
I supported myself by a chair feeling that I was about to fall but this support was soon insufficient on account of my weak arms	271.6921137568502
I fell upon one knee then upon both	716.775258426104
I tried to pray but my tongue was frozen	686.8193838173542
God doubtless neither heard nor saw me and I sank upon the floor a prey to a slumber which resembled death	347.7073863237964
Of all that passed in that sleep or the time which glided away while it lasted I have no remembrance	356.09346773370874
The only thing I recollect is that I awoke in bed in a round chamber the furniture of which was sumptuous and into which light only penetrated by an opening in the ceiling	232.9296998935412
No door gave entrance to the room	5.6492670358386325
It might be called a magnificent prison	4679.582672615832
It was a long time before I was able to make out what place I was in or to take account of the details I describe	170.1447984330174
My mind appeared to strive in vain to shake off the heavy darkness of the sleep from which I could not rouse myself	105.09630579884004
I had vague perceptions of space traversed of the rolling of a carriage of a horrible dream in which my strength had become exhausted but all this was so dark and so indistinct in my mind that these events seemed to belong to another life than mine and yet mixed with mine in fantastic duality	270.3395804218662
At times the state into which I had fallen appeared so strange that I believed myself dreaming	240.67088688148326
My clothes were near me on a chair I neither remembered having undressed myself nor going to bed	784.3758088939002
Then by degrees the reality broke upon me full of chaste terrors	1921.7766408827088
I was no longer in the house where I had dwelt	97.79191578170031
As well as I could judge by the light of the sun the day was already twothirds gone	152.59644583165354
It was the evening before when I had fallen asleep my sleep then must have lasted twentyfour hours What had taken place during this long sleep	239.90436025944575
I dressed myself as quickly as possible my slow and stiff motions all attested that the effects of the narcotic were not yet entirely dissipated	440.79082219724006
The chamber was evidently furnished for the reception of a woman and the most finished coquette could not have formed a wish but on casting her eyes about the apartment she would have found that wish accomplished	202.5022426507346
Certainly I was not the first captive that had been shut up in this splendid prison but you may easily comprehend Felton that the more superb the prison the greater was my terror	468.80669905322844
Yes it was a prison for I tried in vain to get out of it	46.770682067907686
I sounded all the walls in the hopes of discovering a door but everywhere the walls returned a full and flat sound	411.62573854707585
I made the tour of the room at least twenty times in search of an outlet of some kind but there was none	109.63090871505469
I sank exhausted with fatigue and terror into an armchair	73.25231734449929
Meantime night came on rapidly and with night my terrors increased	2282.9704360749474
I did not know but I had better remain where I was seated	106.73982497974106
It appeared that I was surrounded with unknown dangers into which I was about to fall at every instant	219.00309712344986
Although I had eaten nothing since the evening before my fears prevented my feeling hunger	534.133801318695
No noise from without by which I could measure the time reached me I only supposed it must be seven or eight oclock in the evening for it was in the month of October and it was quite dark	113.97169839988742
All at once the noise of a door turning on its hinges made me start	59.8543416346272
A globe of fire appeared above the glazed opening of the ceiling casting a strong light into my chamber and I perceived with terror that a man was standing within a few paces of me	136.35926969404917
A table with two covers bearing a supper ready prepared stood as if by magic in the middle of the apartment	194.77140004318917
That man was he who had pursued me during a whole year who had vowed my dishonor and who by the first words that issued from his mouth gave me to understand he had accomplished it the preceding night	241.6436963891472
Oh yes scoundrel cried Milady seeing the interest which the young officer whose soul seemed to hang on her lips took in this strange recital	212.73649693107893
Oh yes scoundrel He believed having triumphed over me in my sleep that all was completed	509.3764379757385
He came hoping that I would accept my shame as my shame was consummated he came to offer his fortune in exchange for my love	181.6107024967
All that the heart of a woman could contain of haughty contempt and disdainful words I poured out upon this man	336.56660645078296
Doubtless he was accustomed to such reproaches for he listened to me calm and smiling with his arms crossed over his breast	115.35195622770198
Then when he thought I had said all he advanced toward me I sprang toward the table I seized a knife I placed it to my breast	117.22172186295683
Take one step more said I and in addition to my dishonor you shall have my death to reproach yourself with	173.53748834400503
There was no doubt in my look my voice my whole person that sincerity of gesture of attitude of accent which carries conviction to the most perverse minds for he paused	642.6511842471832
Your death said he oh no you are too charming a mistress to allow me to consent to lose you thus after I have had the happiness to possess you only a single time	120.25810493560694
Adieu my charmer I will wait to pay you my next visit till you are in a better humor	94.16050013854883
At these words he blew a whistle the globe of fire which lighted the room reascended and disappeared	590.5403196527042
I found myself again in complete darkness	5760.942633252084
The same noise of a door opening and shutting was repeated the instant afterward the flaming globe descended afresh and I was completely alone	1336.888701179051
This moment was frightful if I had any doubts as to my misfortune these doubts had vanished in an overwhelming reality	409.7289838541477
I was in the power of a man whom I not only detested but despisedof a man capable of anything and who had already given me a fatal proof of what he was able to do	88.49544370663529
But who then was this man asked Felton	5791.585482389382
I passed the night on a chair starting at the least noise for toward midnight the lamp went out and I was again in darkness	251.4168541218967
But the night passed away without any fresh attempt on the part of my persecutor	166.86771074582308
Day came the table had disappeared only I had still the knife in my hand	107.29094302336148
This knife was my only hope	586.878240384022
I was worn out with fatigue	1061.9555802496027
Sleeplessness inflamed my eyes I had not dared to sleep a single instant	78.00482698180829
The light of day reassured me I went and threw myself on the bed without parting with the emancipating knife which I concealed under my pillow	199.10286461807743
When I awoke a fresh meal was served	1902.1529828909142
This time in spite of my terrors in spite of my agony I began to feel a devouring hunger	383.74484851872336
It was fortyeight hours since I had taken any nourishment	209.59801431818877
I ate some bread and some fruit then remembering the narcotic mixed with the water I had drunk I would not touch that which was placed on the table but filled my glass at a marble fountain fixed in the wall over my dressing table	341.8047836339222
And yet notwithstanding these precautions I remained for some time in a terrible agitation of mind	104.31317926493861
But my fears were this time illfounded I passed the day without experiencing anything of the kind I dreaded	844.2207234062893
I took the precaution to half empty the carafe in order that my suspicions might not be noticed	331.7561177587695
The evening came on and with it darkness but however profound was this darkness my eyes began to accustom themselves to it	606.9239946094799
I saw amid the shadows the table sink through the floor a quarter of an hour later it reappeared bearing my supper	308.03121821047216
In an instant thanks to the lamp my chamber was once more lighted	430.78561691042387
I was determined to eat only such things as could not possibly have anything soporific introduced into them	908.6255538015437
Two eggs and some fruit composed my repast then I drew another glass of water from my protecting fountain and drank it	541.8289981920714
At the first swallow it appeared to me not to have the same taste as in the morning	51.2163151281796
I paused but I had already drunk half a glass	383.48690978523524
I threw the rest away with horror and waited with the dew of fear upon my brow	180.80242180793257
No doubt some invisible witness had seen me draw the water from that fountain and had taken advantage of my confidence in it the better to assure my ruin so coolly resolved upon so cruelly pursued	415.34946774543073
Half an hour had not passed when the same symptoms began to appear but as I had only drunk half a glass of the water I contended longer and instead of falling entirely asleep I sank into a state of drowsiness which left me a perception of what was passing around me while depriving me of the strength either to defend myself or to fly	275.34941673782794
I dragged myself toward the bed to seek the only defense I had leftmy saving knife but I could not reach the bolster	712.5245755022487
I sank on my knees my hands clasped round one of the bedposts then I felt that I was lost	124.22389317143636
Felton became frightfully pale and a convulsive tremor crept through his whole body	473.95040354632846
And what was most frightful continued Milady her voice altered as if she still experienced the same agony as at that awful minute was that at this time I retained a consciousness of the danger that threatened me was that my soul if I may say so waked in my sleeping body was that I saw that I heard	286.91088264791057
It is true that all was like a dream but it was not the less frightful	58.03193580544006
I saw the lamp ascend and leave me in darkness then I heard the wellknown creaking of the door although I had heard that door open but twice	274.98356691956394
I felt instinctively that someone approached me it is said that the doomed wretch in the deserts of America thus feels the approach of the serpent	315.972887176426
I wished to make an effort I attempted to cry out	207.78191036630218
By an incredible effort of will I even raised myself up but only to sink down again immediately and to fall into the arms of my persecutor	158.02538268983483
Tell me who this man was cried the young officer	504.96251825619925
Milady saw at a single glance all the painful feelings she inspired in Felton by dwelling on every detail of her recital but she would not spare him a single pang	357.3967781670816
The more profoundly she wounded his heart the more certainly he would avenge her	183.11077534930234
She continued then as if she had not heard his exclamation or as if she thought the moment was not yet come to reply to it	72.03017621536286
Only this time it was no longer an inert body without feeling that the villain had to deal with	420.2381693336974
I have told you that without being able to regain the complete exercise of my faculties I retained the sense of my danger	218.3633715024415
I struggled then with all my strength and doubtless opposed weak as I was a long resistance for I heard him cry out These miserable Puritans I knew very well that they tired out their executioners but I did not believe them so strong against their lovers	353.9540096132835
Alas this desperate resistance could not last long	182.03338335167822
I felt my strength fail and this time it was not my sleep that enabled the coward to prevail but my swoon	334.71552874977795
Felton listened without uttering any word or sound except an inward expression of agony	415.2837752504233
The sweat streamed down his marble forehead and his hand under his coat tore his breast	120.04344226326118
My first impulse on coming to myself was to feel under my pillow for the knife I had not been able to reach if it had not been useful for defense it might at least serve for expiation	183.7640361295041
But on taking this knife Felton a terrible idea occurred to me	769.9921649066259
I have sworn to tell you all and I will tell you all	12.864584999551173
I have promised you the truth I will tell it were it to destroy me	74.48355554597144
The idea came into your mind to avenge yourself on this man did it not cried Felton	295.0203515776097
The idea was not that of a Christian I knew but without doubt that eternal enemy of our souls that lion roaring constantly around us breathed it into my mind	600.5245687680193
In short what shall I say to you Felton continued Milady in the tone of a woman accusing herself of a crime	236.73072380830376
This idea occurred to me and did not leave me it is of this homicidal thought that I now bear the punishment	123.96309360361786
Continue continue said Felton I am eager to see you attain your vengeance	121.8294508310421
Oh I resolved that it should take place as soon as possible	21.745494464362682
I had no doubt he would return the following night	225.10801801923134
During the day I had nothing to fear	77.25423129978132
When the hour of breakfast came therefore I did not hesitate to eat and drink	284.799674121056
I had determined to make believe sup but to eat nothing	1197.0986309178543
I was forced then to combat the fast of the evening with the nourishment of the morning	184.85723037521254
Only I concealed a glass of water which remained after my breakfast thirst having been the chief of my sufferings when I remained fortyeight hours without eating or drinking	309.87133609244427
The day passed away without having any other influence on me than to strengthen the resolution I had formed only I took care that my face should not betray the thoughts of my heart for I had no doubt I was watched	93.97884670373696
Several times even I felt a smile on my lips	22.525332073895715
Felton I dare not tell you at what idea I smiled you would hold me in horror	170.52294911774388
Go on go on said Felton you see plainly that I listen and that I am anxious to know the end	160.76715551632296
Evening came the ordinary events took place	145.63041506288013
During the darkness as before my supper was brought	425.45745678211597
Then the lamp was lighted and I sat down to table	48.55764366154787
I pretended to pour out water from the jug but I only drank that which I had saved in my glass	129.40451930902074
The substitution was made so carefully that my spies if I had any could have no suspicion of it	168.53242538726545
After supper I exhibited the same marks of languor as on the preceding evening but this time as I yielded to fatigue or as if I had become familiarized with danger I dragged myself toward my bed let my robe fall and lay down	346.2638818449721
I found my knife where I had placed it under my pillow and while feigning to sleep my hand grasped the handle of it convulsively	224.57696822896818
Two hours passed away without anything fresh happening	33180.78236505126
Oh my God who could have said so the evening before I began to fear that he would not come	71.05798825760101
At length I saw the lamp rise softly and disappear in the depths of the ceiling my chamber was filled with darkness and obscurity but I made a strong effort to penetrate this darkness and obscurity	176.21470156579153
Nearly ten minutes passed I heard no other noise but the beating of my own heart	102.0040907581477
I implored heaven that he might come	118.65700388769557
At length I heard the wellknown noise of the door which opened and shut I heard notwithstanding the thickness of the carpet a step which made the floor creak I saw notwithstanding the darkness a shadow which approached my bed	316.7374666670522
Haste haste said Felton do you not see that each of your words burns me like molten lead	311.9084026102625
Then continued Milady then I collected all my strength I recalled to my mind that the moment of vengeance or rather of justice had struck	107.63396561832154
I looked upon myself as another Judith I gathered myself up my knife in my hand and when I saw him near me stretching out his arms to find his victim then with the last cry of agony and despair I struck him in the middle of his breast	100.7341375064683
The miserable villain He had foreseen all	453.3845690245267
His breast was covered with a coatofmail the knife was bent against it	299.84089611684675
Ah ah cried he seizing my arm and wresting from me the weapon that had so badly served me you want to take my life do you my pretty Puritan But that s more than dislike that s ingratitude Come come calm yourself my sweet girl I thought you had softened	454.96310283015924
I am not one of those tyrants who detain women by force	2075.6769496398997
With my usual fatuity I doubted it now I am convinced	163.29350500733216
I had but one wish that was that he should kill me	43.06200432934464
Beware said I for my liberty is your dishonor	601.5052250932927
Yes for as soon as I leave this place I will tell everything	49.711740561623266
I will proclaim the violence you have used toward me	132.8521309642934
I will denounce this place of infamy	1164.4314955802288
You are placed on high my Lord but tremble Above you there is the king above the king there is God	539.992068230696
However perfect master he was over himself my persecutor allowed a movement of anger to escape him	566.7913415969484
I could not see the expression of his countenance but I felt the arm tremble upon which my hand was placed	92.47111451931823
Then you shall not leave this place said he	49.86299615531589
Very well cried I then the place of my punishment will be that of my tomb	86.807905400753
I will die here and you will see if a phantom that accuses is not more terrible than a living being that threatens	315.7005624257033
You shall have no weapon left in your power	167.02434245384302
There is a weapon which despair has placed within the reach of every creature who has the courage to use it	200.64117698825984
I will allow myself to die with hunger	70.15165971541268
Come said the wretch is not peace much better than such a war as that I will restore you to liberty this moment I will proclaim you a piece of immaculate virtue I will name you the Lucretia of England	204.2549649190664
And I will say that you are the Sextus	200.37720091101815
I will denounce you before men as I have denounced you before God and if it be necessary that like Lucretia I should sign my accusation with my blood I will sign it	190.59947588626278
Ah said my enemy in a jeering tone that s quite another thing	489.70000503418794
My faith everything considered you are very well off here	246.57615213028626
You shall want for nothing and if you let yourself die of hunger that will be your own fault	46.7580836930364
I heard the door open and shut and I remained overwhelmed less I confess it by my grief than by the mortification of not having avenged myself	338.79251437677215
All the day all the next night passed away without my seeing him again	192.5544141327677
But I also kept my word with him and I neither ate nor drank	239.25020076348542
I was as I told him resolved to die of hunger	157.70271995080859
I passed the day and the night in prayer for I hoped that God would pardon me my suicide	226.47405211869057
The second night the door opened I was lying on the floor for my strength began to abandon me	60.06807208094853
At the noise I raised myself up on one hand	94.30427544819358
Well said a voice which vibrated in too terrible a manner in my ear not to be recognized well Are we softened a little Will we not pay for our liberty with a single promise of silence Come I am a good sort of a prince added he and although I like not Puritans I do them justice and it is the same with Puritanesses when they are pretty	225.11962607695534
Come take a little oath for me on the cross I wo nt ask anything more of you	106.62626920396256
On the cross cried I rising for at that abhorred voice I had recovered all my strength on the cross I swear that no promise no menace no force no torture shall close my mouth On the cross I swear to denounce you everywhere as a murderer as a thief of honor as a base coward On the cross I swear if I ever leave this place to call down vengeance upon you from the whole human race	357.93951089555765
Beware said the voice in a threatening accent that I had never yet heard	86.64264044538342
I have an extraordinary means which I will not employ but in the last extremity to close your mouth or at least to prevent anyone from believing a word you may utter	148.92368270482757
I mustered all my strength to reply to him with a burst of laughter	42.40632112840583
He saw that it was a merciless war between usa war to the death	1367.0644325114715
I give you the rest of tonight and all day tomorrow	175.33336032476282
Reflect promise to be silent and riches consideration even honor shall surround you threaten to speak and I will condemn you to infamy	673.8022642889441
Oh I declare to you Felton I thought him mad	1325.9996457782702
Begone if you do not desire to see me dash my head against that wall before your eyes	319.0522173209976
Very well it is your own doing	466.3528432868264
Till tomorrow evening then replied I allowing myself to fall and biting the carpet with rage	331.09908800302776
Felton leaned for support upon a piece of furniture and Milady saw with the joy of a demon that his strength would fail him perhaps before the end of her recital	159.6708729948836
After a moment of silence employed by Milady in observing the young man who listened to her Milady continued her recital	476.25953070482495
It was nearly three days since I had eaten or drunk anything	222.3720162627809
At times there passed before me clouds which pressed my brow which veiled my eyes this was delirium	883.0118495055412
When the evening came I was so weak that every time I fainted I thanked God for I thought I was about to die	138.60984265873654
In the midst of one of these swoons I heard the door open	158.24979000740748
He entered the apartment followed by a man in a mask	24.81802548363378
He was masked likewise but I knew his step I knew his voice I knew him by that imposing bearing which hell has bestowed upon his person for the curse of humanity	367.4575793831176
Well said he to me have you made your mind up to take the oath I requested of you	227.14480901350552
You have said Puritans have but one word	107.61236321540584
Mine you have heard and that is to pursue youon earth to the tribunal of men in heaven to the tribunal of God	199.77411736256144
I swear it before the God who hears me	230.79839773347214
I will take the whole world as a witness of your crime and that until I have found an avenger	157.1076765624577
You are a prostitute said he in a voice of thunder and you shall undergo the punishment of prostitutes Branded in the eyes of the world you invoke try to prove to that world that you are neither guilty nor mad	198.78427407758292
Then addressing the man who accompanied him Executioner said he do your duty	260.34848145265227
Oh his name his name cried Felton	20294.682508726266
Then in spite of my cries in spite of my resistancefor I began to comprehend that there was a question of something worse than deaththe executioner seized me threw me on the floor fastened me with his bonds and suffocated by sobs almost without sense invoking God who did not listen to me I uttered all at once a frightful cry of pain and shame	292.83039432407764
A burning fire a redhot iron the iron of the executioner was imprinted on my shoulder	201.5122121276596
Here said Milady rising with the majesty of a queen here Felton behold the new martyrdom invented for a pure young girl the victim of the brutality of a villain	435.4995602675333
Learn to know the heart of men and henceforth make yourself less easily the instrument of their unjust vengeance	518.4740720932892
Milady with a rapid gesture opened her robe tore the cambric that covered her bosom and red with feigned anger and simulated shame showed the young man the ineffaceable impression which dishonored that beautiful shoulder	1005.0647018443761
But cried Felton that is a fleurdelis which I see there	200.44934812308165
And therein consisted the infamy replied Milady	36040.539912549226
The brand of Englandit would be necessary to prove what tribunal had imposed it on me and I could have made a public appeal to all the tribunals of the kingdom but the brand of Franceoh by that by that I was branded indeed	274.0878699490702
This was too much for Felton	2321266.0152099035
Pale motionless overwhelmed by this frightful revelation dazzled by the superhuman beauty of this woman who unveiled herself before him with an immodesty which appeared to him sublime he ended by falling on his knees before her as the early Christians did before those pure and holy martyrs whom the persecution of the emperors gave up in the circus to the sanguinary sensuality of the populace	376.9487442571687
The brand disappeared the beauty alone remained	5984.242891261309
Pardon Pardon cried Felton oh pardon	17356828.08066663
Milady read in his eyes love love	3610.4267196737737
Pardon me for having joined with your persecutors	536.1558805677414
Milady held out her hand to him	12.746821503202561
So beautiful so young cried Felton covering that hand with his kisses	3602.5924869422793
Milady let one of those looks fall upon him which make a slave of a king	279.0349178051875
Felton was a Puritan he abandoned the hand of this woman to kiss her feet	161.10727476869855
He no longer loved her he adored her	327.1696050655937
When this crisis was past when Milady appeared to have resumed her selfpossession which she had never lost when Felton had seen her recover with the veil of chastity those treasures of love which were only concealed from him to make him desire them the more ardently he said Ah now I have only one thing to ask of you that is the name of your true executioner	182.2591297174299
For to me there is but one the other was an instrument that was all	270.443571130577
What brother cried Milady must I name him again Have you not yet divined who he is	370.1019759134951
What cried Felton heagain healways he Whatthe truly guilty	5440.782939629698
The truly guilty said Milady is the ravager of England the persecutor of true believers the base ravisher of the honor of so many womenhe who to satisfy a caprice of his corrupt heart is about to make England shed so much blood who protects the Protestants today and will betray them tomorrow	646.6104402012779
Buckingham It is then Buckingham cried Felton in a high state of excitement	557.7197852258339
Milady concealed her face in her hands as if she could not endure the shame which this name recalled to her	70.74038495439235
Buckingham the executioner of this angelic creature cried Felton	12884.282999742874
And thou hast not hurled thy thunder at him my God And thou hast left him noble honored powerful for the ruin of us all	725.7386800418902
God abandons him who abandons himself said Milady	1421.708994863267
But he will draw upon his head the punishment reserved for the damned said Felton with increasing exultation	871.7513437998313
He wills that human vengeance should precede celestial justice	14078.192258795123
Men fear him and spare him	110.03248312341026
I said Felton I do not fear him nor will I spare him	97.27097200447957
The soul of Milady was bathed in an infernal joy	676.9736277286952
But how can Lord de Winter my protector my father asked Felton possibly be mixed up with all this	607.7366770410556
Listen Felton resumed Milady for by the side of base and contemptible men there are often found great and generous natures	558.0948909290478
I had an affianced husband a man whom I loved and who loved mea heart like yours Felton a man like you	185.7038869475846
I went to him and told him all he knew me that man did and did not doubt an instant	137.60023016248297
He was a nobleman a man equal to Buckingham in every respect	493.021476517596
He said nothing he only girded on his sword wrapped himself in his cloak and went straight to Buckingham Palace	240.88777922276884
Yes yes said Felton I understand how he would act	188.4954102884983
But with such men it is not the sword that should be employed it is the poniard	89.93412377613302
Buckingham had left England the day before sent as ambassador to Spain to demand the hand of the Infanta for King Charles I	341.05273873394924
who was then only Prince of Wales	201.62850949575687
Hear me said he this man has gone and for the moment has consequently escaped my vengeance but let us be united as we were to have been and then leave it to Lord de Winter to maintain his own honor and that of his wife	117.5666908978965
Yes said Milady Lord de Winter and now you can understand it all can you not Buckingham remained nearly a year absent	289.18071965251994
A week before his return Lord de Winter died leaving me his sole heir	487.55356902696536
Whence came the blow God who knows all knows without doubt but as for me I accuse nobody	522.4762121877507
Oh what an abyss what an abyss cried Felton	50655.91859131851
Lord de Winter died without revealing anything to his brother	335.86281739419144
The terrible secret was to be concealed till it burst like a clap of thunder over the head of the guilty	120.39999465316438
Your protector had seen with pain this marriage of his elder brother with a portionless girl	495.8510784091949
I was sensible that I could look for no support from a man disappointed in his hopes of an inheritance	244.38974355679207
I went to France with a determination to remain there for the rest of my life	68.46583036340883
But all my fortune is in England	245.96158177662278
Communication being closed by the war I was in want of everything	194.96869715678852
I was then obliged to come back again	52.392832534515854
Six days ago I landed at Portsmouth	3828.350476252983
Well Buckingham heard by some means no doubt of my return	60.828984850638506
He spoke of me to Lord de Winter already prejudiced against me and told him that his sisterinlaw was a prostitute a branded woman	627.4612159704836
The noble and pure voice of my husband was no longer here to defend me	89.72464166692019
Lord de Winter believed all that was told him with so much the more ease that it was his interest to believe it	63.4709297756995
He caused me to be arrested had me conducted hither and placed me under your guard	740.2777151795137
The day after tomorrow he banishes me he transports me the day after tomorrow he exiles me among the infamous	544.3296726168268
Oh the train is well laid the plot is clever	1450.9205263832655
My honor will not survive it You see then Felton I can do nothing but die	236.4822249550071
And at these words as if all her strength was exhausted Milady sank weak and languishing into the arms of the young officer who intoxicated with love anger and voluptuous sensations hitherto unknown received her with transport pressed her against his heart all trembling at the breath from that charming mouth bewildered by the contact with that palpitating bosom	658.4096147826228
No you shall live honored and pure you shall live to triumph over your enemies	652.2269908343543
Milady put him from her slowly with her hand while drawing him nearer with her look but Felton in his turn embraced her more closely imploring her like a divinity	491.3415121188304
Oh death death said she lowering her voice and her eyelids oh death rather than shame Felton my brother my friend I conjure you	772.6875403106516
No cried Felton no you shall live and you shall be avenged	50.853539702315736
Felton I bring misfortune to all who surround me Felton abandon me Felton let me die	1055.5546046985864
Well then we will live and die together cried he pressing his lips to those of the prisoner	139.9179373214204
Several strokes resounded on the door this time Milady really pushed him away from her	493.76999275566624
Hark said she we have been overheard Someone is coming All is over We are lost	883.0129904711987
No said Felton it is only the sentinel warning me that they are about to change the guard	172.65402842823596
Then run to the door and open it yourself	377.8310505551453
Felton obeyed this woman was now his whole thought his whole soul	616.3307671887848
He found himself face to face with a sergeant commanding a watchpatrol	764.8796739967902
Well what is the matter asked the young lieutenant	207.46855220941214
You told me to open the door if I heard anyone cry out said the soldier but you forgot to leave me the key	117.87599108446562
I heard you cry out without understanding what you said	208.94920390204126
I tried to open the door but it was locked inside then I called the sergeant	133.1387440887075
And here I am said the sergeant	427.43585352118345
Felton quite bewildered almost mad stood speechless	49406.46339597987
Milady plainly perceived that it was now her turn to take part in the scene	108.06039015530193
She ran to the table and seizing the knife which Felton had laid down exclaimed And by what right will you prevent me from dying	338.2221702656004
Great God exclaimed Felton on seeing the knife glitter in her hand	229.09057593152656
At that moment a burst of ironical laughter resounded through the corridor	441.7667200699293
The baron attracted by the noise in his chamber gown his sword under his arm stood in the doorway	201.25500692479412
Ah said he here we are at the last act of the tragedy	66.39750132386312
You see Felton the drama has gone through all the phases I named but be easy no blood will flow	819.9186620012374
Milady perceived that all was lost unless she gave Felton an immediate and terrible proof of her courage	744.3442363724463
You are mistaken my Lord blood will flow and may that blood fall back on those who cause it to flow	926.0987193610038
Felton uttered a cry and rushed toward her	211.0854721497265
He was too late Milady had stabbed herself	252.82749368832333
But the knife had fortunately we ought to say skillfully come in contact with the steel busk which at that period like a cuirass defended the chests of women	529.0287320717703
It had glided down it tearing the robe and had penetrated slantingly between the flesh and the ribs	1335.2011670592733
Miladys robe was not the less stained with blood in a second	226.00519659676795
Milady fell down and seemed to be in a swoon	112.76510788148374
See my Lord said he in a deep gloomy tone here is a woman who was under my guard and who has killed herself	124.10156746899885
Be at ease Felton said Lord de Winter	351.93373245243373
She is not dead demons do not die so easily	55.24627322604231
Be tranquil and go wait for me in my chamber	33.477122757320174
At this injunction from his superior Felton obeyed but in going out he put the knife into his bosom	352.307881630824
As to Lord de Winter he contented himself with calling the woman who waited on Milady and when she was come he recommended the prisoner who was still fainting to her care and left them alone	164.56241163505888
Meanwhile all things considered and notwithstanding his suspicions as the wound might be serious he immediately sent off a mounted man to find a physician	477.22227310305254
As Lord de Winter had thought Miladys wound was not dangerous	4180.421465477416
So soon as she was left alone with the woman whom the baron had summoned to her assistance she opened her eyes	69.88800288486273
It was however necessary to affect weakness and painnot a very difficult task for so finished an actress as Milady	1989.703869069251
Thus the poor woman was completely the dupe of the prisoner whom notwithstanding her hints she persisted in watching all night	374.0264276497648
But the presence of this woman did not prevent Milady from thinking	855.5336576786639
There was no longer a doubt that Felton was convinced Felton was hers	2870.2935553358493
If an angel appeared to that young man as an accuser of Milady he would take him in the mental disposition in which he now found himself for a messenger sent by the devil	146.16213559451074
Milady smiled at this thought for Felton was now her only hopeher only means of safety	1605.741645149543
But Lord de Winter might suspect him Felton himself might now be watched	1357.5838074427747
Toward four oclock in the morning the doctor arrived but since the time Milady stabbed herself however short the wound had closed	540.613987663779
The doctor could therefore measure neither the direction nor the depth of it he only satisfied himself by Miladys pulse that the case was not serious	354.43643015675076
In the morning Milady under the pretext that she had not slept well in the night and wanted rest sent away the woman who attended her	228.21905949575623
She had one hope which was that Felton would appear at the breakfast hour but Felton did not come	265.03475243970644
Were her fears realized Was Felton suspected by the baron about to fail her at the decisive moment She had only one day left	493.7416465739709
Lord de Winter had announced her embarkation for the twentythird and it was now the morning of the twentysecond	196.88832070225916
Nevertheless she still waited patiently till the hour for dinner	67.21228445636072
Although she had eaten nothing in the morning the dinner was brought in at its usual time	58.283211489248856
Milady then perceived with terror that the uniform of the soldiers who guarded her was changed	120.90853741534254
Then she ventured to ask what had become of Felton	413.8826405015669
She was told that he had left the castle an hour before on horseback	66.98562640939737
She inquired if the baron was still at the castle	64.27167711266138
The soldier replied that he was and that he had given orders to be informed if the prisoner wished to speak to him	43.8746465282359
Milady replied that she was too weak at present and that her only desire was to be left alone	152.74293516575062
The soldier went out leaving the dinner served	1454.1584883144662
This was the last blow to the prisoner	207.78520886874995
The bed which she had kept from prudence and that they might believe her seriously wounded burned her like a bed of fire	456.17700175043296
She cast a glance at the door the baron had had a plank nailed over the grating	168.02425839451098
He no doubt feared that by this opening she might still by some diabolical means corrupt her guards	1386.6350211615131
She was free now to give way to her transports without being observed	314.94259048054084
She traversed her chamber with the excitement of a furious maniac or of a tigress shut up in an iron cage	393.65322522299465
Certes if the knife had been left in her power she would now have thought not of killing herself but of killing the baron	183.40289135087582
At six oclock Lord de Winter came in	281.7982314664109
He was armed at all points	4322.93065144764
This man in whom Milady till that time had only seen a very simple gentleman had become an admirable jailer	259.3075987168193
He appeared to foresee all to divine all to anticipate all	1096.8808740150291
A single look at Milady apprised him of all that was passing in her mind	97.36899685694067
Ay said he I see but you shall not kill me today	41.75699923033526
You have no longer a weapon and besides I am on my guard	147.604843168455
You had begun to pervert my poor Felton	1148.7086901899372
He was yielding to your infernal influence but I will save him	177.89367295979955
He will never see you again all is over	64.39631861134647
I had fixed the embarkation for the twentyfourth but I have reflected that the more promptly the affair takes place the more sure it will be	171.66912216649882
Tomorrow by twelve oclock I shall have the order for your exile signed Buckingham	595.0055023010699
If you speak a single word to anyone before going aboard ship my sergeant will blow your brains out	1294.723242944225
He has orders to do so	2.053488511011816
If when on the ship you speak a single word to anyone before the captain permits you the captain will have you thrown into the sea	136.9957853739915
Au revoir then that is all I have to say today	47.10816953741427
Tomorrow I will see you again to take my leave	71.23523284068206
With these words the baron went out	120.28736803312606
Milady had listened to all this menacing tirade with a smile of disdain on her lips but rage in her heart	87.48118628256368
Milady felt that she stood in need of all her strength	100.51798445985365
She did not know what might take place during this night which approached so menacinglyfor large masses of cloud rolled over the face of the sky and distant lightning announced a storm	255.30883751215978
The storm broke about ten oclock	2.684546343340854
Milady felt a consolation in seeing nature partake of the disorder of her heart	300.81001133593725
The thunder growled in the air like the passion and anger in her thoughts	185.95923294332852
It appeared to her that the blast as it swept along disheveled her brow as it bowed the branches of the trees and bore away their leaves	502.5341965416619
She howled as the hurricane howled and her voice was lost in the great voice of nature which also seemed to groan with despair	191.1194191986397
All at once she heard a tap at her window and by the help of a flash of lightning she saw the face of a man appear behind the bars	102.90328772206468
She ran to the window and opened it	14.301656597602316
Yes said Felton but silence silence I must have time to file through these bars	587.5011846958387
Only take care that I am not seen through the wicket	173.71431670842122
Oh it is a proof that the Lord is on our side Felton replied Milady	1321.9958718085545
They have closed up the grating with a board	485.5392152817525
That is well God has made them senseless said Felton	3288.7602005211374
But what must I do asked Milady	14354.18953867378
Nothing nothing only shut the window	452.27384730339185
Go to bed or at least lie down in your clothes	161.72103566726278
As soon as I have done I will knock on one of the panes of glass	43.688595956277915
But will you be able to follow me	25.63622105383014
Gives me pain but will not prevent my walking	368.127053454162
Be ready then at the first signal	849.6969211904635
Milady shut the window extinguished the lamp and went as Felton had desired her to lie down on the bed	135.86442211886433
Amid the moaning of the storm she heard the grinding of the file upon the bars and by the light of every flash she perceived the shadow of Felton through the panes	179.99052661404377
She passed an hour without breathing panting with a cold sweat upon her brow and her heart oppressed by frightful agony at every movement she heard in the corridor	287.2433965637566
There are hours which last a year	177.69769285020138
At the expiration of an hour Felton tapped again	8837.763678354075
Milady sprang out of bed and opened the window	24.635816532709484
Two bars removed formed an opening for a man to pass through	68.84192634952399
Must I take anything with me	20.664354194550327
Yes fortunately they have left me all I had	35.061099845958076
So much the better for I have expended all mine in chartering a vessel	648.6888002257909
Here said Milady placing a bag full of louis in Feltons hands	906.5551054523526
Felton took the bag and threw it to the foot of the wall	22.139425153010222
Now said he will you come	248.2818304795265
Milady mounted upon a chair and passed the upper part of her body through the window	89.75858258902055
She saw the young officer suspended over the abyss by a ladder of ropes	579.69672084771
For the first time an emotion of terror reminded her that she was a woman	162.40753102099953
Its nothing its nothing said Milady	793927.4112520305
I will descend with my eyes shut	399.39766353598463
Have you confidence in me said Felton	6892.287894615433
Felton tied her two wrists together with his handkerchief and then with a cord over the handkerchief	85.02188250084423
What are you doing asked Milady with surprise	3789.7701406365677
Pass your arms around my neck and fear nothing	239.23959520490197
But I shall make you lose your balance and we shall both be dashed to pieces	212.5411661730447
Not a second was to be lost	33.64342496542504
Milady passed her two arms round Feltons neck and let herself slip out of the window	348.67585906802935
Felton began to descend the ladder slowly step by step	904.1779564745563
Despite the weight of two bodies the blast of the hurricane shook them in the air	256.197942492084
What is the matter asked Milady	1655742.8574800896
Silence said Felton I hear footsteps	4509432.970074683
There was a silence of several seconds	3165.003193933528
No said Felton it is nothing	413.0029212322928
But what then is the noise	416.23420417694894
That of the patrol going their rounds	11385.175422904198
No if it does not lighten	401233.1559613951
But they will run against the bottom of the ladder	32.73104189274032
Fortunately it is too short by six feet	552.3435366044741
Both remained suspended motionless and breathless within twenty paces of the ground while the patrol passed beneath them laughing and talking	411.1025164672812
This was a terrible moment for the fugitives	209.86144920310758
The noise of their retreating footsteps and the murmur of their voices soon died away	397.0905022588975
Now said Felton we are safe	9004.478404613148
Milady breathed a deep sigh and fainted	120.10374211611285
Near the bottom of the ladder when he found no more support for his feet he clung with his hands at length arrived at the last step he let himself hang by the strength of his wrists and touched the ground	142.80311691311465
He stooped down picked up the bag of money and placed it between his teeth	42.29865563461989
Then he took Milady in his arms and set off briskly in the direction opposite to that which the patrol had taken	141.76231139126025
He soon left the pathway of the patrol descended across the rocks and when arrived on the edge of the sea whistled	140.79373223938484
A similar signal replied to him and five minutes after a boat appeared rowed by four men	195.06810783901417
The boat approached as near as it could to the shore but there was not depth enough of water for it to touch land	213.28227839092654
Felton walked into the sea up to his middle being unwilling to trust his precious burden to anybody	709.2076116337909
Fortunately the storm began to subside but still the sea was disturbed	575.9953406423034
The little boat bounded over the waves like a nutshell	146.745151877228
To the sloop said Felton and row quickly	1740.372652407369
The four men bent to their oars but the sea was too high to let them get much hold of it	195.60406298596592
However they left the castle behind that was the principal thing	222.28164463814073
It was almost impossible to see the shore from the boat they would therefore be less likely to see the boat from the shore	88.36878187901306
A black point floated on the sea	43.47073147704622
While the boat was advancing with all the speed its four rowers could give it Felton untied the cord and then the handkerchief which bound Miladys hands together	926.9520473382428
When her hands were loosed he took some sea water and sprinkled it over her face	249.4506121629004
Milady breathed a sigh and opened her eyes	91.90429655760717
Yes there is the sky here is the sea The air I breathe is the air of liberty Ah thanks Felton thanks	1488.955702372142
The young man pressed her to his heart	42.92565850716522
But what is the matter with my hands asked Milady it seems as if my wrists had been crushed in a vice	212.418508070288
Milady held out her arms her wrists were bruised	6966.535056097052
Alas said Felton looking at those beautiful hands and shaking his head sorrowfully	186.17643927137112
Oh its nothing nothing cried Milady	3787243.8115551043
Milady looked around her as if in search of something	46.79314278471287
It is there said Felton touching the bag of money with his foot	117.94466290351855
They drew near to the sloop	19726.440943918857
A sailor on watch hailed the boat the boat replied	302.453070465961
What vessel is that asked Milady	756291.682046829
The one I have hired for you	21.432442155939178
Where you please after you have put me on shore at Portsmouth	428.56339225961176
What are you going to do at Portsmouth asked Milady	2423.066691170651
Accomplish the orders of Lord de Winter said Felton with a gloomy smile	165.14399361832616
You do not understand asked Felton	3910237.296218428
As he mistrusted me he determined to guard you himself and sent me in his place to get Buckingham to sign the order for your transportation	322.58912318750043
But if he mistrusted you how could he confide such an order to you	175.9611509480676
How could I know what I was the bearer of	34.581710614697535
That s true And you are going to Portsmouth	113.70285910863403
I have no time to lose	23.973064902861818
Tomorrow is the twentythird and Buckingham sets sail tomorrow with his fleet	4939.665053494452
He sets sail tomorrow Where for	67.88094199915102
He need not sail cried Milady forgetting her usual presence of mind	1734.4216058726477
Be satisfied replied Felton he will not sail	133.37202212720004
She could read to the depths of the heart of this young man the death of Buckingham was written there at full length	88.956312305725
Felton cried she you are as great as Judas Maccabeus If you die I will die with you that is all I can say to you	83.48193219484777
Silence cried Felton we are here	107.07623624468923
In fact they touched the sloop	22919.58898690044
Felton mounted the ladder first and gave his hand to Milady while the sailors supported her for the sea was still much agitated	189.11223798270555
An instant after they were on the deck	89.96237398203787
Captain said Felton this is the person of whom I spoke to you and whom you must convey safe and sound to France	93.07991373903256
For a thousand pistoles said the captain	84.74155290185229
I have paid you five hundred of them	54.49248321911401
That s correct said the captain	1408.6615792709154
And here are the other five hundred replied Milady placing her hand upon the bag of gold	254.31202047675384
No said the captain I make but one bargain and I have agreed with this young man that the other five hundred shall not be due to me till we arrive at Boulogne	196.10182913208664
Safe and sound as true as my names Jack Butler	3077.7939431110362
Well said Milady if you keep your word instead of five hundred I will give you a thousand pistoles	76.67198553497074
Hurrah for you then my beautiful lady cried the captain and may God often send me such passengers as your Ladyship	781.3215152778866
Meanwhile said Felton convey me to the little bay of you know it was agreed you should put in there	334.9978637853399
The captain replied by ordering the necessary maneuvers and toward seven oclock in the morning the little vessel cast anchor in the bay that had been named	244.71440777278283
During this passage Felton related everything to Miladyhow instead of going to London he had chartered the little vessel how he had returned how he had scaled the wall by fastening cramps in the interstices of the stones as he ascended to give him foothold and how when he had reached the bars he fastened his ladder	329.3872687811145
On her side Milady tried to encourage Felton in his project but at the first words which issued from her mouth she plainly saw that the young fanatic stood more in need of being moderated than urged	612.31950041796
It was agreed that Milady should wait for Felton till ten oclock if he did not return by ten oclock she was to sail	126.83723785324942
In that case and supposing he was at liberty he was to rejoin her in France at the convent of the Carmelites at Bthune	113.07698458135053
WHAT TOOK PLACE AT PORTSMOUTH AUGUST 23 1628	10015.606018827331
Felton took leave of Milady as a brother about to go for a mere walk takes leave of his sister kissing her hand	214.63972472467088
His whole body appeared in its ordinary state of calmness only an unusual fire beamed from his eyes like the effects of a fever his brow was more pale than it generally was his teeth were clenched and his speech had a short dry accent which indicated that something dark was at work within him	274.6407710377854
As long as he remained in the boat which conveyed him to land he kept his face toward Milady who standing on the deck followed him with her eyes	123.28931039155324
Both were free from the fear of pursuit nobody ever came into Miladys apartment before nine oclock and it would require three hours to go from the castle to London	433.17786124054226
Felton jumped onshore climbed the little ascent which led to the top of the cliff saluted Milady a last time and took his course toward the city	241.5023666637308
At the end of a hundred paces the ground began to decline and he could only see the mast of the sloop	130.63063764381747
He immediately ran in the direction of Portsmouth which he saw at nearly half a league before him standing out in the haze of the morning with its houses and towers	227.57503277811898
Beyond Portsmouth the sea was covered with vessels whose masts like a forest of poplars despoiled by the winter bent with each breath of the wind	665.4889770222152
Felton in his rapid walk reviewed in his mind all the accusations against the favorite of James I	439.01924329055095
furnished by two years of premature meditation and a long sojourn among the Puritans	1627.9903193882913
When he compared the public crimes of this ministerstartling crimes European crimes if so we may saywith the private and unknown crimes with which Milady had charged him Felton found that the more culpable of the two men which formed the character of Buckingham was the one of whom the public knew not the life	432.4494632233265
This was because his love so strange so new and so ardent made him view the infamous and imaginary accusations of Milady de Winter as through a magnifying glass one views as frightful monsters atoms in reality imperceptible by the side of an ant	757.0223830175363
The rapidity of his walk heated his blood still more the idea that he left behind him exposed to a frightful vengeance the woman he loved or rather whom he adored as a saint the emotion he had experienced present fatigueall together exalted his mind above human feeling	523.1624503880964
He entered Portsmouth about eight oclock in the morning	3.2765147015782023
The whole population was on foot drums were beating in the streets and in the port the troops about to embark were marching toward the sea	708.2891547475615
Felton arrived at the palace of the Admiralty covered with dust and streaming with perspiration	172.5343536629857
His countenance usually so pale was purple with heat and passion	459.81434835434925
The sentinel wanted to repulse him but Felton called to the officer of the post and drawing from his pocket the letter of which he was the bearer he said A pressing message from Lord de Winter	156.18720903687776
At the name of Lord de Winter who was known to be one of his Graces most intimate friends the officer of the post gave orders to let Felton pass who besides wore the uniform of a naval officer	242.28639920267796
At the moment he entered the vestibule another man was entering likewise dusty out of breath leaving at the gate a post horse which on reaching the palace tumbled on his foreknees	626.1204521578185
Felton and he addressed Patrick the dukes confidential lackey at the same moment	477.22465108289305
Felton named Lord de Winter the unknown would not name anybody and pretended that it was to the duke alone he would make himself known	283.32783315464525
Each was anxious to gain admission before the other	1042.9526657255342
Patrick who knew Lord de Winter was in affairs of the service and in relations of friendship with the duke gave the preference to the one who came in his name	122.7534567082102
The other was forced to wait and it was easily to be seen how he cursed the delay	174.32064699032793
The valet led Felton through a large hall in which waited the deputies from La Rochelle headed by the Prince de Soubise and introduced him into a closet where Buckingham just out of the bath was finishing his toilet upon which as at all times he bestowed extraordinary attention	511.0360950048203
Lieutenant Felton from Lord de Winter said Patrick	8930.047818362196
From Lord de Winter repeated Buckingham let him come in	382.0907733466235
At that moment Buckingham was throwing upon a couch a rich toilet robe worked with gold in order to put on a blue velvet doublet embroidered with pearls	349.0636132313071
Why did nt the baron come himself demanded Buckingham	10973.634264879576
He desired me to tell your Grace replied Felton that he very much regretted not having that honor but that he was prevented by the guard he is obliged to keep at the castle	242.74111503837145
Yes I know that said Buckingham he has a prisoner	460.19227533736506
It is of that prisoner that I wish to speak to your Grace replied Felton	230.96730320784602
That which I have to say of her can only be heard by yourself my Lord	156.42360811739832
Leave us Patrick said Buckingham but remain within sound of the bell	126.74549552431898
We are alone sir said Buckingham speak	185881.20107490863
My Lord said Felton the Baron de Winter wrote to you the other day to request you to sign an order of embarkation relative to a young woman named Charlotte Backson	313.29950087737404
Yes sir and I answered him to bring or send me that order and I would sign it	188.26588256926237
Give it to me said the duke	58.652446384331064
And taking it from Felton he cast a rapid glance over the paper and perceiving that it was the one that had been mentioned to him he placed it on the table took a pen and prepared to sign it	56.07108740955208
Pardon my Lord said Felton stopping the duke but does your Grace know that the name of Charlotte Backson is not the true name of this young woman	232.32156913821396
Yes sir I know it replied the duke dipping the quill in the ink	346.9573372319971
Then your Grace knows her real name asked Felton in a sharp tone	296.4926276111346
I know it and the duke put the quill to the paper	339.7896511985249
And knowing that real name my Lord replied Felton will you sign it all the same	648.7198055022308
Doubtless said Buckingham and rather twice than once	896.2952758572834
I can not believe continued Felton in a voice that became more sharp and rough that your Grace knows that it is to Milady de Winter this relates	572.4539154857423
I know it perfectly although I am astonished that you know it	33.72656316464644
And will your Grace sign that order without remorse	2201.835036377691
Buckingham looked at the young man haughtily	460.0112680604703
Do you know sir that you are asking me very strange questions and that I am very foolish to answer them	112.52082185378516
Reply to them my Lord said Felton the circumstances are more serious than you perhaps believe	301.3239274410377
Buckingham reflected that the young man coming from Lord de Winter undoubtedly spoke in his name and softened	661.9200996269238
The baron knows as well as myself that Milady de Winter is a very guilty woman and it is treating her very favorably to commute her punishment to transportation	493.9280526889648
The duke put his pen to the paper	27.554924361600964
You will not sign that order my Lord said Felton making a step toward the duke	984.1347895533415
I will not sign this order And why not	2109.339912023341
Because you will look into yourself and you will do justice to the lady	72.8267872835558
I should do her justice by sending her to Tyburn said Buckingham	934.9741195095098
My Lord Milady de Winter is an angel you know that she is and I demand her liberty of you	91.73491550266439
Bah Are you mad to talk to me thus said Buckingham	333.2982600297074
My Lord excuse me I speak as I can I restrain myself	154.32359838573979
But my Lord think of what you re about to do and beware of going too far	272.99884001458855
What do you say God pardon me cried Buckingham I really think he threatens me	397.3290452302154
No my Lord I still plead	38633.91643374373
And I say to you one drop of water suffices to make the full vase overflow one slight fault may draw down punishment upon the head spared despite many crimes	2381.0852072036905
Felton said Buckingham you will withdraw and place yourself at once under arrest	680.970109629071
You will hear me to the end my Lord	316.2109787510943
You have seduced this young girl you have outraged defiled her	758.726091599471
Repair your crimes toward her let her go free and I will exact nothing else from you	246.7018834351946
You will exact said Buckingham looking at Felton with astonishment and dwelling upon each syllable of the three words as he pronounced them	261.02713371726225
My Lord continued Felton becoming more excited as he spoke my Lord beware All England is tired of your iniquities my Lord you have abused the royal power which you have almost usurped my Lord you are held in horror by God and men	573.5883745946606
God will punish you hereafter but I will punish you here	52.70699524768321
Ah this is too much cried Buckingham making a step toward the door	284.79839078496184
I ask it humbly of you my Lord said he sign the order for the liberation of Milady de Winter	534.7068365345615
Remember that she is a woman whom you have dishonored	100.05522984733099
Withdraw sir said Buckingham or I will call my attendant and have you placed in irons	187.1263164252144
You shall not call said Felton throwing himself between the duke and the bell placed on a stand encrusted with silver	358.72695201010384
Beware my Lord you are in the hands of God	36.24507922816589
In the hands of the devil you mean cried Buckingham raising his voice so as to attract the notice of his people without absolutely shouting	473.5561869978449
Sign my Lord sign the liberation of Milady de Winter said Felton holding out a paper to the duke	618.7398696475645
By force You are joking Holloa Patrick	149899.28096716254
Help shouted the duke and at the same time he sprang toward his sword	41.3943380354807
But Felton did not give him time to draw it	88.34382175246772
He held the knife with which Milady had stabbed herself open in his bosom at one bound he was upon the duke	277.36318469232725
At that moment Patrick entered the room crying A letter from France my Lord	487.82839047388023
From France cried Buckingham forgetting everything in thinking from whom that letter came	703.3181282872029
Felton took advantage of this moment and plunged the knife into his side up to the handle	120.0490594016858
Ah traitor cried Buckingham you have killed me	33.30085153875933
Felton cast his eyes round for means of escape and seeing the door free he rushed into the next chamber in which as we have said the deputies from La Rochelle were waiting crossed it as quickly as possible and rushed toward the staircase but upon the first step he met Lord de Winter who seeing him pale confused livid and stained with blood both on his hands and face seized him by the throat crying I knew it I guessed it But too late by a minute unfortunate unfortunate that I am	188.9090453989562
Lord de Winter placed him in the hands of the guards who led him while awaiting further orders to a little terrace commanding the sea and then the baron hastened to the dukes chamber	218.91344411506995
At the cry uttered by the duke and the scream of Patrick the man whom Felton had met in the antechamber rushed into the chamber	255.06515035303033
He found the duke reclining upon a sofa with his hand pressed upon the wound	83.15813611915866
Laporte said the duke in a dying voice Laporte do you come from her	155.82926775281513
Yes monseigneur replied the faithful cloak bearer of Anne of Austria but too late perhaps	655.7741557439712
Silence Laporte you may be overheard	11174.100369055599
Oh I can not tell what she says to me My God I am dying	102.9305002006214
Meanwhile Lord de Winter the deputies the leaders of the expedition the officers of Buckinghams household had all made their way into the chamber	389.1067177553987
Cries of despair resounded on all sides	33.2861335585902
The news which filled the palace with tears and groans soon became known and spread itself throughout the city	1023.3006995892296
The report of a cannon announced that something new and unexpected had taken place	247.48251081130027
Lord de Winter tore his hair	1101.782330799374
Too late by a minute cried he too late by a minute Oh my God my God what a misfortune	161.62866462997135
He had been informed at seven oclock in the morning that a rope ladder floated from one of the windows of the castle he had hastened to Miladys chamber had found it empty the window open and the bars filed had remembered the verbal caution DArtagnan had transmitted to him by his messenger had trembled for the duke and running to the stable without taking time to have a horse saddled had jumped upon the first he found had galloped off like the wind had alighted below in the courtyard had ascended the stairs precipitately and on the top step as we have said had encountered Felton	292.4109977023704
The duke however was not dead	622.2577386595493
He recovered a little reopened his eyes and hope revived in all hearts	319.3410647287044
Gentlemen said he leave me alone with Patrick and Laporteah is that you De Winter You sent me a strange madman this morning See the state in which he has put me	390.65924098845375
Oh my Lord cried the baron I shall never console myself	214.3441449881855
And you would be quite wrong my dear De Winter said Buckingham holding out his hand to him	139.84486900489696
I do not know the man who deserves being regretted during the whole life of another man but leave us I pray you	185.46978776946526
There only remained in the closet of the wounded duke Laporte and Patrick	1828.0155954792913
A physician was sought for but none was yet found	1018.3132321793418
You will live my Lord you will live repeated the faithful servant of Anne of Austria on his knees before the dukes sofa	124.05389351393144
What has she written to me said Buckingham feebly streaming with blood and suppressing his agony to speak of her he loved what has she written to me Read me her letter	536.4619610068586
Obey Laporte do you not see I have no time to lose	20.151665856220724
Laporte broke the seal and placed the paper before the eyes of the duke but Buckingham in vain tried to make out the writing	162.49511895214366
Read said he read I can not see	27.40684837818328
Read then For soon perhaps I shall not hear and I shall die without knowing what she has written to me	59.6130779553128
Laporte made no further objection and read	262.3484697915713
MY LORD By that which since I have known you have suffered by you and for you I conjure you if you have any care for my repose to countermand those great armaments which you are preparing against France to put an end to a war of which it is publicly said religion is the ostensible cause and of which it is generally whispered your love for me is the concealed cause	246.97895801473788
This war may not only bring great catastrophes upon England and France but misfortune upon you my Lord for which I should never console myself	816.044461294807
Be careful of your life which is menaced and which will be dear to me from the moment I am not obliged to see an enemy in you	66.88153132368544
Buckingham collected all his remaining strength to listen to the reading of the letter then when it was ended as if he had met with a bitter disappointment he asked Have you nothing else to say to me by the living voice Laporte	93.65821088143456
The queen charged me to tell you to watch over yourself for she had advice that your assassination would be attempted	271.9180888212582
And is that allis that all replied Buckingham impatiently	3835.143704378694
She likewise charged me to tell you that she still loved you	58.926042954309196
Ah said Buckingham God be praised My death then will not be to her as the death of a stranger	150.92589991354913
Patrick said the duke bring me the casket in which the diamond studs were kept	367.67158523902987
Patrick brought the object desired which Laporte recognized as having belonged to the queen	601.731429203046
Now the scent bag of white satin on which her cipher is embroidered in pearls	619.8802591851434
Here Laporte said Buckingham these are the only tokens I ever received from herthis silver casket and these two letters	518.9960323437964
You will restore them to her Majesty and as a last memorialhe looked round for some valuable objectyou will add	748.9810009628673
He still sought but his eyes darkened by death encountered only the knife which had fallen from the hand of Felton still smoking with the blood spread over its blade	307.02021881055254
And you will add to them this knife said the duke pressing the hand of Laporte	244.49387033327312
He had just strength enough to place the scent bag at the bottom of the silver casket and to let the knife fall into it making a sign to Laporte that he was no longer able to speak then in a last convulsion which this time he had not the power to combat he slipped from the sofa to the floor	133.12621241143125
Buckingham tried to smile a last time but death checked his thought which remained engraved on his brow like a last kiss of love	454.75715445941677
At this moment the dukes surgeon arrived quite terrified he was already on board the admirals ship where they had been obliged to seek him	357.00147033285054
He approached the duke took his hand held it for an instant in his own and letting it fall All is useless said he he is dead	91.36835114100377
At this cry all the crowd reentered the apartment and throughout the palace and town there was nothing but consternation and tumult	394.1421913746169
As soon as Lord de Winter saw Buckingham was dead he ran to Felton whom the soldiers still guarded on the terrace of the palace	520.8408400896651
Wretch said he to the young man who since the death of Buckingham had regained that coolness and selfpossession which never after abandoned him wretch what have you done	247.37509208539717
I have avenged myself said he	14.255232645584634
Rather say that you have served as an instrument to that accursed woman but I swear to you that this crime shall be her last	156.51730053155097
I do nt know what you mean replied Felton quietly and I am ignorant of whom you are speaking my Lord	157.91403763952664
I killed the Duke of Buckingham because he twice refused you yourself to appoint me captain I have punished him for his injustice that is all	359.25699235461695
De Winter stupefied looked on while the soldiers bound Felton and could not tell what to think of such insensibility	580.5842123936434
One thing alone however threw a shade over the pallid brow of Felton	375.1536124234889
At every noise he heard the simple Puritan fancied he recognized the step and voice of Milady coming to throw herself into his arms to accuse herself and die with him	232.6148633938497
His eyes became fixed upon a point of the sea commanded by the terrace where he was	92.22050230906524
With the eagle glance of a sailor he had recognized there where another would have seen only a gull hovering over the waves the sail of a sloop which was directed toward the coast of France	239.8222767556405
He grew deadly pale placed his hand upon his heart which was breaking and at once perceived all the treachery	80.49219768381572
One last favor my Lord said he to the baron	66.99259368757915
The baron drew out his watch	96.07446405609286
It wants ten minutes to nine said he	259.8535281288723
Milady had hastened her departure by an hour and a half	49.63103363294704
As soon as she heard the cannon which announced the fatal event she had ordered the anchor to be weighed	251.53584955249548
The vessel was making way under a blue sky at great distance from the coast	267.63070911371403
God has so willed it said he with the resignation of a fanatic but without however being able to take his eyes from that ship on board of which he doubtless fancied he could distinguish the white outline of her to whom he had sacrificed his life	119.84109666177326
De Winter followed his look observed his feelings and guessed all	385.96817422572707
Be punished alone for the first miserable man said Lord de Winter to Felton who was being dragged away with his eyes turned toward the sea but I swear to you by the memory of my brother whom I have loved so much that your accomplice is not saved	106.73273882049338
Felton lowered his head without pronouncing a syllable	2252.245531183079
As to Lord de Winter he descended the stairs rapidly and went straight to the port	175.43024274177859
The first fear of the King of England Charles I	501.81726280716805
on learning of the death of the duke was that such terrible news might discourage the Rochellais he tried says Richelieu in his Memoirs to conceal it from them as long as possible closing all the ports of his kingdom and carefully keeping watch that no vessel should sail until the army which Buckingham was getting together had gone taking upon himself in default of Buckingham to superintend the departure	556.9269610268736
He carried the strictness of this order so far as to detain in England the ambassadors of Denmark who had taken their leave and the regular ambassador of Holland who was to take back to the port of Flushing the Indian merchantmen of which Charles I	237.0676354755649
had made restitution to the United Provinces	41190.86527499088
But as he did not think of giving this order till five hours after the eventthat is to say till two oclock in the afternoontwo vessels had already left the port the one bearing as we know Milady who already anticipating the event was further confirmed in that belief by seeing the black flag flying at the masthead of the admirals ship	577.8344487461741
As to the second vessel we will tell hereafter whom it carried and how it set sail	771.4983115759476
During this time nothing new occurred in the camp at La Rochelle only the king who was bored as always but perhaps a little more so in camp than elsewhere resolved to go incognito and spend the festival of St	764.0772082467254
Germain and asked the cardinal to order him an escort of only twenty Musketeers	587.9887054526001
The cardinal who sometimes became weary of the king granted this leave of absence with great pleasure to his royal lieutenant who promised to return about the fifteenth of September	324.17917043238106
de Trville being informed of this by his Eminence packed his portmanteau and as without knowing the cause he knew the great desire and even imperative need which his friends had of returning to Paris it goes without saying that he fixed upon them to form part of the escort	300.5881955152885
The four young men heard the news a quarter of an hour after M	64.10515194106647
de Trville for they were the first to whom he communicated it	116.37151163251077
It was then that DArtagnan appreciated the favor the cardinal had conferred upon him in making him at last enter the Musketeersfor without that circumstance he would have been forced to remain in the camp while his companions left it	241.18380367071094
It goes without saying that this impatience to return toward Paris had for a cause the danger which Mme	752.3278231241636
Bonacieux would run of meeting at the convent of Bthune with Milady her mortal enemy	917.5204554282924
Aramis therefore had written immediately to Marie Michon the seamstress at Tours who had such fine acquaintances to obtain from the queen authority for Mme	1151.569450005762
Bonacieux to leave the convent and to retire either into Lorraine or Belgium	737.3290229781094
They had not long to wait for an answer	93.12282349951397
Eight or ten days afterward Aramis received the following letter	678.982698177269
MY DEAR COUSIN Here is the authorization from my sister to withdraw our little servant from the convent of Bthune the air of which you think is bad for her	199.11719925717455
My sister sends you this authorization with great pleasure for she is very partial to the little girl to whom she intends to be more serviceable hereafter	356.34559698391524
To this letter was added an order conceived in these terms	1011.2726064575708
At the Louvre August 10 1628	39524.30272310182
The superior of the convent of Bthune will place in the hands of the person who shall present this note to her the novice who entered the convent upon my recommendation and under my patronage	183.19772370389876
It may be easily imagined how the relationship between Aramis and a seamstress who called the queen her sister amused the young men but Aramis after having blushed two or three times up to the whites of his eyes at the gross pleasantry of Porthos begged his friends not to revert to the subject again declaring that if a single word more was said to him about it he would never again implore his cousins to interfere in such affairs	310.56227310019756
There was no further question therefore about Marie Michon among the four Musketeers who besides had what they wanted that was the order to withdraw Mme	912.8063147863039
Bonacieux from the convent of the Carmelites of Bthune	691.4914071924645
It was true that this order would not be of great use to them while they were in camp at La Rochelle that is to say at the other end of France	98.8011528539754
Therefore DArtagnan was going to ask leave of absence of M	213.39218606391395
de Trville confiding to him candidly the importance of his departure when the news was transmitted to him as well as to his three friends that the king was about to set out for Paris with an escort of twenty Musketeers and that they formed part of the escort	97.93690387547326
The lackeys were sent on before with the baggage and they set out on the morning of the sixteenth	109.50993794468162
The cardinal accompanied his Majesty from Surgres to Mauzes and there the king and his minister took leave of each other with great demonstrations of friendship	261.9049812666597
The king however who sought distraction while traveling as fast as possiblefor he was anxious to be in Paris by the twentythirdstopped from time to time to fly the magpie a pastime for which the taste had been formerly inspired in him by de Luynes and for which he had always preserved a great predilection	320.3663239423712
Out of the twenty Musketeers sixteen when this took place rejoiced greatly at this relaxation but the other four cursed it heartily	1660.2185331463438
DArtagnan in particular had a perpetual buzzing in his ears which Porthos explained thus A very great lady has told me that this means that somebody is talking of you somewhere	674.8138409455881
At length the escort passed through Paris on the twentythird in the night	112.57768022799729
de Trville and permitted him to distribute furloughs for four days on condition that the favored parties should not appear in any public place under penalty of the Bastille	460.70065539401276
The first four furloughs granted as may be imagined were to our four friends	263.53853766518364
Still further Athos obtained of M	132.04080453221175
de Trville six days instead of four and introduced into these six days two more nightsfor they set out on the twentyfourth at five oclock in the evening and as a further kindness M	197.12137908158883
de Trville postdated the leave to the morning of the twentyfifth	115.98891201440014
Good Lord said DArtagnan who as we have often said never stumbled at anything	592.3976145661813
It appears to me that we are making a great trouble of a very simple thing	145.77198530616272
In two days and by using up two or three horses that s nothing I have plenty of money I am at Bthune	250.25206159456047
I present my letter from the queen to the superior and I bring back the dear treasure I go to seeknot into Lorraine not into Belgium but to Paris where she will be much better concealed particularly while the cardinal is at La Rochelle	462.37922270404067
Well once returned from the country half by the protection of her cousin half through what we have personally done for her we shall obtain from the queen what we desire	305.9760820046406
Remain then where you are and do not exhaust yourselves with useless fatigue	1341.8952190807895
Myself and Planchet are all that such a simple expedition requires	447.9410253475369
To this Athos replied quietly We also have money leftfor I have not yet drunk all my share of the diamond and Porthos and Aramis have not eaten all theirs	422.446444123166
We can therefore use up four horses as well as one	124.9075186068712
But consider DArtagnan added he in a tone so solemn that it made the young man shudder consider that Bthune is a city where the cardinal has given rendezvous to a woman who wherever she goes brings misery with her	203.87011360624516
If you had only to deal with four men DArtagnan I would allow you to go alone	190.93884139881322
You have to do with that woman We four will go and I hope to God that with our four lackeys we may be in sufficient number	492.15228607352884
You terrify me Athos cried DArtagnan	4108.973721899007
My God what do you fear	360.8461088724531
DArtagnan examined the countenances of his companions which like that of Athos wore an impression of deep anxiety and they continued their route as fast as their horses could carry them but without adding another word	226.15460438920041
On the evening of the twentyfifth as they were entering Arras and as DArtagnan was dismounting at the inn of the Golden Harrow to drink a glass of wine a horseman came out of the post yard where he had just had a relay started off at a gallop and with a fresh horse took the road to Paris	196.37799589835242
At the moment he passed through the gateway into the street the wind blew open the cloak in which he was wrapped although it was in the month of August and lifted his hat which the traveler seized with his hand the moment it had left his head pulling it eagerly over his eyes	168.6706991616598
DArtagnan who had his eyes fixed upon this man became very pale and let his glass fall	134.79326628380477
What is the matter monsieur said Planchet	331.7674789949375
Oh come gentlemen my master is ill	125.55106033526852
The three friends hastened toward DArtagnan who instead of being ill ran toward his horse	225.98154436922374
They stopped him at the door	4.791767300420145
Well where the devil are you going now cried Athos	164.66076161654485
It is he cried DArtagnan pale with anger and with the sweat on his brow it is he let me overtake him	91.33384084685945
That cursed man my evil genius whom I have always met with when threatened by some misfortune he who accompanied that horrible woman when I met her for the first time he whom I was seeking when I offended our Athos he whom I saw on the very morning Madame Bonacieux was abducted	229.20275768290892
I have seen him that is he I recognized him when the wind blew upon his cloak	268.2845705706821
To saddle gentlemen to saddle Let us pursue him and we shall overtake him	92.29697131959591
My dear friend said Aramis remember that he goes in an opposite direction from that in which we are going that he has a fresh horse and ours are fatigued so that we shall disable our own horses without even a chance of overtaking him	200.45807293065369
Let the man go DArtagnan let us save the woman	112.85241133288085
Monsieur monsieur cried a hostler running out and looking after the stranger monsieur here is a paper which dropped out of your hat Eh monsieur eh	574.6514985951309
Friend said DArtagnan a halfpistole for that paper	434.0713011188862
My faith monsieur with great pleasure Here it is	196.79512885621062
The hostler enchanted with the good days work he had done returned to the yard	228.00403139087888
Well eagerly demanded all his three friends	271.55678655695345
Nothing but one word said DArtagnan	3075.859475412373
Yes said Aramis but that one word is the name of some town or village	138.85991109462304
Armentires read Porthos Armentires I do nt know such a place	47.01949459471935
And that name of a town or village is written in her hand cried Athos	455.54719549935385
Come on come on said DArtagnan let us keep that paper carefully perhaps I have not thrown away my halfpistole	369.66523915297785
To horse my friends to horse	11558.38510006625
And the four friends flew at a gallop along the road to Bthune	133.93089907229748
Great criminals bear about them a kind of predestination which makes them surmount all obstacles which makes them escape all dangers up to the moment which a wearied Providence has marked as the rock of their impious fortunes	491.3724234711005
She escaped the cruisers of both nations and arrived at Boulogne without accident	716.2459007406588
When landing at Portsmouth Milady was an Englishwoman whom the persecutions of the French drove from La Rochelle when landing at Boulogne after a two days passage she passed for a Frenchwoman whom the English persecuted at Portsmouth out of their hatred for France	604.2359761625003
Milady had likewise the best of passportsher beauty her noble appearance and the liberality with which she distributed her pistoles	1017.4254155360281
Freed from the usual formalities by the affable smile and gallant manners of an old governor of the port who kissed her hand she only remained long enough at Boulogne to put into the post a letter conceived in the following terms	355.2840568209435
To his Eminence Monseigneur the Cardinal Richelieu in his camp before La Rochelle	1308.5735929943578
MONSEIGNEUR Let your Eminence be reassured	5169.490844584368
His Grace the Duke of Buckingham will not set out for France	165.84429156916707
According to the desire of your Eminence I report to the convent of the Carmelites at Bthune where I will await your orders	473.63091676008094
Accordingly that same evening Milady commenced her journey	3424.060982818735
Night overtook her she stopped and slept at an inn	119.28162266197606
At five oclock the next morning she again proceeded and in three hours after entered Bthune	274.4605724525585
She inquired for the convent of the Carmelites and went thither immediately	251.7526499145503
The superior met her Milady showed her the cardinals order	771.9266201919521
The abbess assigned her a chamber and had breakfast served	1369.8960224692578
All the past was effaced from the eyes of this woman and her looks fixed on the future beheld nothing but the high fortunes reserved for her by the cardinal whom she had so successfully served without his name being in any way mixed up with the sanguinary affair	237.60386174613896
The evernew passions which consumed her gave to her life the appearance of those clouds which float in the heavens reflecting sometimes azure sometimes fire sometimes the opaque blackness of the tempest and which leave no traces upon the earth behind them but devastation and death	529.1237368256193
After breakfast the abbess came to pay her a visit	37.70502166789849
There is very little amusement in the cloister and the good superior was eager to make the acquaintance of her new boarder	215.72639544844094
Milady wished to please the abbess	157207.59852888994
This was a very easy matter for a woman so really superior as she was	170.01679176492732
She tried to be agreeable and she was charming winning the good superior by her varied conversation and by the graces of her whole personality	539.4268732845014
The abbess who was the daughter of a noble house took particular delight in stories of the court which so seldom travel to the extremities of the kingdom and which above all have so much difficulty in penetrating the walls of convents at whose threshold the noise of the world dies away	295.6170686445669
Milady on the contrary was quite conversant with all aristocratic intrigues amid which she had constantly lived for five or six years	284.57418385497664
She made it her business therefore to amuse the good abbess with the worldly practices of the court of France mixed with the eccentric pursuits of the king she made for her the scandalous chronicle of the lords and ladies of the court whom the abbess knew perfectly by name touched lightly on the amours of the queen and the Duke of Buckingham talking a great deal to induce her auditor to talk a little	330.36102045012507
But the abbess contented herself with listening and smiling without replying a word	183.73248800783404
Milady however saw that this sort of narrative amused her very much and kept at it only she now let her conversation drift toward the cardinal	746.132420918202
She did not know whether the abbess was a royalist or a cardinalist she therefore confined herself to a prudent middle course	705.6514208050162
But the abbess on her part maintained a reserve still more prudent contenting herself with making a profound inclination of the head every time the fair traveler pronounced the name of his Eminence	792.1610429613849
Milady began to think she should soon grow weary of a convent life she resolved then to risk something in order that she might know how to act afterward	400.9889900637476
Desirous of seeing how far the discretion of the good abbess would go she began to tell a story obscure at first but very circumstantial afterward about the cardinal relating the amours of the minister with Mme	706.4322517159342
dAiguillon Marion de Lorme and several other gay women	15879.489917245191
The abbess listened more attentively grew animated by degrees and smiled	1301.9849244819848
Good thought Milady she takes a pleasure in my conversation	174.9195731556987
If she is a cardinalist she has no fanaticism at least	367.1948853115512
She then went on to describe the persecutions exercised by the cardinal upon his enemies	482.4181705695847
The abbess only crossed herself without approving or disapproving	8829.566567630653
This confirmed Milady in her opinion that the abbess was rather royalist than cardinalist	809.4241564519722
Milady therefore continued coloring her narrations more and more	941.3644745313152
I am very ignorant of these matters said the abbess at length but however distant from the court we may be however remote from the interests of the world we may be placed we have very sad examples of what you have related	220.03577557351247
And one of our boarders has suffered much from the vengeance and persecution of the cardinal	280.10594527487257
One of your boarders said Milady oh my God Poor woman I pity her then	1559.5661571766805
And you have reason for she is much to be pitied	201.96303520017065
Imprisonment menaces ill treatmentshe has suffered everything	991.2417445537515
But after all resumed the abbess Monsieur Cardinal has perhaps plausible motives for acting thus and though she has the look of an angel we must not always judge people by the appearance	717.1823179286754
Good said Milady to herself who knows I am about perhaps to discover something here I am in the vein	166.20096295219236
She tried to give her countenance an appearance of perfect candor	668.8352377038102
Alas said Milady I know it is so	17.51918190643413
It is said that we must not trust to the face but in what then shall we place confidence if not in the most beautiful work of the Lord As for me I shall be deceived all my life perhaps but I shall always have faith in a person whose countenance inspires me with sympathy	166.6232205905958
You would then be tempted to believe said the abbess that this young person is innocent	222.25739383354733
The cardinal pursues not only crimes said she there are certain virtues which he pursues more severely than certain offenses	1206.5099232076684
Permit me madame to express my surprise said the abbess	420.9580993762668
At what said Milady with the utmost ingenuousness	1239.362435781903
What do you find so astonishing in that language said Milady smiling	681.273211501415
You are the friend of the cardinal for he sends you hither and yet	317.4052790686804
And yet I speak ill of him replied Milady finishing the thought of the superior	648.3724260978979
At least you do nt speak well of him	257.789985228066
That is because I am not his friend said she sighing but his victim	262.86599015108465
But this letter in which he recommends you to me	151.4339657222566
Is an order for me to confine myself to a sort of prison from which he will release me by one of his satellites	120.1452046449902
But why have you not fled	24235.81499928431
Whither should I go Do you believe there is a spot on the earth which the cardinal can not reach if he takes the trouble to stretch forth his hand If I were a man that would barely be possible but what can a woman do This young boarder of yours has she tried to fly	287.03026735303365
No that is true but shethat is another thing I believe she is detained in France by some love affair	389.0629545393565
Ah said Milady with a sigh if she loves she is not altogether wretched	379.3553772422064
Then said the abbess looking at Milady with increasing interest I behold another poor victim	1455.2415496565743
The abbess looked at her for an instant with uneasiness as if a fresh thought suggested itself to her mind	154.7283289764056
You are not an enemy of our holy faith said she hesitatingly	650.370696436707
WhoI cried Milady I a Protestant Oh no I call to witness the God who hears us that on the contrary I am a fervent Catholic	215.89836419844934
Then madame said the abbess smiling be reassured the house in which you are shall not be a very hard prison and we will do all in our power to make you cherish your captivity	141.54503167367963
You will find here moreover the young woman of whom I spoke who is persecuted no doubt in consequence of some court intrigue	183.79320723237998
She was sent to me by someone of high rank under the name of Kitty	297.04625759717425
I have not tried to discover her other name	624.0360436301995
That she is called so Yes madame	7348.284447978971
Milady smiled to herself at the idea which had occurred to her that this might be her old chambermaid	169.056090196584
There was connected with the remembrance of this girl a remembrance of anger and a desire of vengeance disordered the features of Milady which however immediately recovered the calm and benevolent expression which this woman of a hundred faces had for a moment allowed them to lose	208.21612822270495
And when can I see this young lady for whom I already feel so great a sympathy asked Milady	379.30940183741563
Why this evening said the abbess today even	13775.734683201563
But you have been traveling these four days as you told me yourself	95.17118455890694
This morning you rose at five oclock you must stand in need of repose	155.75549398057174
Go to bed and sleep at dinnertime we will rouse you	627.9876241415216
Although Milady would very willingly have gone without sleep sustained as she was by all the excitements which a new adventure awakened in her heart ever thirsting for intrigues she nevertheless accepted the offer of the superior	522.457188846463
During the last fifteen days she had experienced so many and such various emotions that if her frame of iron was still capable of supporting fatigue her mind required repose	490.56116750974587
She therefore took leave of the abbess and went to bed softly rocked by the ideas of vengeance which the name of Kitty had naturally brought to her thoughts	181.51918783879177
She remembered that almost unlimited promise which the cardinal had given her if she succeeded in her enterprise	428.0726332219666
She had succeeded DArtagnan was then in her power	215.98111499471378
One thing alone frightened her that was the remembrance of her husband the Comte de la Fre whom she had believed dead or at least expatriated and whom she found again in Athosthe best friend of DArtagnan	207.4956860048393
But alas if he was the friend of DArtagnan he must have lent him his assistance in all the proceedings by whose aid the queen had defeated the project of his Eminence if he was the friend of DArtagnan he was the enemy of the cardinal and she doubtless would succeed in involving him in the vengeance by which she hoped to destroy the young Musketeer	190.70696671247634
All these hopes were so many sweet thoughts for Milady so rocked by them she soon fell asleep	866.920094374302
She was awakened by a soft voice which sounded at the foot of her bed	82.75089599040986
She opened her eyes and saw the abbess accompanied by a young woman with light hair and delicate complexion who fixed upon her a look full of benevolent curiosity	183.4794421327257
The face of the young woman was entirely unknown to her	81.38955848826211
Each examined the other with great attention while exchanging the customary compliments both were very handsome but of quite different styles of beauty	796.8022030731997
Milady however smiled in observing that she excelled the young woman by far in her high air and aristocratic bearing	632.7759259964363
It is true that the habit of a novice which the young woman wore was not very advantageous in a contest of this kind	325.12993547671294
The abbess introduced them to each other	45.842011170172825
When this formality was ended as her duties called her to chapel she left the two young women alone	311.02766278983836
The novice seeing Milady in bed was about to follow the example of the superior but Milady stopped her	165.96253607929992
How madame said she I have scarcely seen you and you already wish to deprive me of your company upon which I had counted a little I must confess for the time I have to pass here	94.958093036972
No madame replied the novice only I thought I had chosen my time ill you were asleep you are fatigued	271.7210231340931
Well said Milady what can those who sleep wish fora happy awakening This awakening you have given me allow me then to enjoy it at my ease and taking her hand she drew her toward the armchair by the bedside	369.3166945794905
How unfortunate I am said she I have been here six months without the shadow of recreation	108.42578202801744
You arrive and your presence was likely to afford me delightful company yet I expect in all probability to quit the convent at any moment	214.35816785611357
How you are going soon asked Milady	10489.14777601086
At least I hope so said the novice with an expression of joy which she made no effort to disguise	61.3146829496738
I think I learned you had suffered persecutions from the cardinal continued Milady that would have been another motive for sympathy between us	562.1842858050079
What I have heard then from our good mother is true you have likewise been a victim of that wicked priest	284.0429705063955
Hush said Milady let us not even here speak thus of him	312.27872668868406
All my misfortunes arise from my having said nearly what you have said before a woman whom I thought my friend and who betrayed me	101.17906671391175
Are you also the victim of a treachery	105.84186890491797
No said the novice but of my devotionof a devotion to a woman I loved for whom I would have laid down my life for whom I would give it still	111.66192548343538
And who has abandoned youis that it	165.5157715015558
I have been sufficiently unjust to believe so but during the last two or three days I have obtained proof to the contrary for which I thank Godfor it would have cost me very dear to think she had forgotten me	136.87026017065665
But you madame you appear to be free continued the novice and if you were inclined to fly it only rests with yourself to do so	174.16455706221632
Whither would you have me go without friends without money in a part of France with which I am unacquainted and where I have never been before	118.02111181899507
Oh cried the novice as to friends you would have them wherever you want you appear so good and are so beautiful	148.3016536002096
That does not prevent replied Milady softening her smile so as to give it an angelic expression my being alone or being persecuted	740.9384858705116
Hear me said the novice we must trust in heaven	211.76388354595733
There always comes a moment when the good you have done pleads your cause before God and see perhaps it is a happiness for you humble and powerless as I am that you have met with me for if I leave this place wellI have powerful friends who after having exerted themselves on my account may also exert themselves for you	219.74636142948742
Oh when I said I was alone said Milady hoping to make the novice talk by talking of herself it is not for want of friends in high places but these friends themselves tremble before the cardinal	413.9599484425521
The queen herself does not dare to oppose the terrible minister	194.5326433576057
I have proof that her Majesty notwithstanding her excellent heart has more than once been obliged to abandon to the anger of his Eminence persons who had served her	223.45636288788162
Trust me madame the queen may appear to have abandoned those persons but we must not put faith in appearances	307.35675230508065
The more they are persecuted the more she thinks of them and often when they least expect it they have proof of a kind remembrance	324.6889729317468
Alas said Milady I believe so the queen is so good	110.94470671596555
Oh you know her then that lovely and noble queen that you speak of her thus cried the novice with enthusiasm	515.4273226256165
That is to say replied Milady driven into her entrenchment that I have not the honor of knowing her personally but I know a great number of her most intimate friends	209.35803869193154
I am acquainted with Monsieur de Putange I met Monsieur Dujart in England I know Monsieur de Trville	476.59235282658733
Monsieur de Trville exclaimed the novice do you know Monsieur de Trville	295.43587035918074
The captain of the kings Musketeers	508495.0200387977
The captain of the kings Musketeers	508495.0200387977
Why then only see cried the novice we shall soon be well acquainted almost friends	375.7111200812498
If you know Monsieur de Trville you must have visited him	99.44227327397026
Often said Milady who having entered this track and perceiving that falsehood succeeded was determined to follow it to the end	365.591719421646
With him then you must have seen some of his Musketeers	131.80684601851806
All those he is in the habit of receiving replied Milady for whom this conversation began to have a real interest	281.1045163727113
Name a few of those whom you know and you will see if they are my friends	45.883958523630334
Well said Milady embarrassed I know Monsieur de Louvigny Monsieur de Courtivron Monsieur de Ferussac	776.9101070255094
The novice let her speak then seeing that she paused she said Do nt you know a gentleman named Athos	264.09112014303764
Milady became as pale as the sheets in which she was lying and mistress as she was of herself could not help uttering a cry seizing the hand of the novice and devouring her with looks	203.83150287589677
What is the matter Good God asked the poor woman have I said anything that has wounded you	145.7244144253206
No but the name struck me because I also have known that gentleman and it appeared strange to me to meet with a person who appears to know him well	94.76255280331712
Oh yes very well not only him but some of his friends Messieurs Porthos and Aramis	284.164488569284
Indeed you know them likewise I know them cried Milady who began to feel a chill penetrate her heart	306.9118374707461
Well if you know them you know that they are good and free companions	117.69726599264828
Why do you not apply to them if you stand in need of help	152.7968507231145
That is to say stammered Milady I am not really very intimate with any of them	154.2665050230678
I know them from having heard one of their friends Monsieur dArtagnan say a great deal about them	235.0257822888247
You know Monsieur dArtagnan cried the novice in her turn seizing the hands of Milady and devouring her with her eyes	140.35760954033594
Then remarking the strange expression of Miladys countenance she said Pardon me madame you know him by what title	241.3130501411423
Why replied Milady embarrassed why by the title of friend	83.25768897394241
You deceive me madame said the novice you have been his mistress	144.30980827807687
It is you who have been his mistress madame cried Milady in her turn	340.76400227021605
Yes you I know you now	156.81833652657693
The young woman drew back filled with surprise and terror	155.31561284554186
Oh do not deny it Answer continued Milady	83508.42430786636
Well yes madame said the novice Are we rivals	47749.82283513333
The countenance of Milady was illumined by so savage a joy that under any other circumstances Mme	775.0346046194046
Bonacieux would have fled in terror but she was absorbed by jealousy	236.70843380384937
Bonacieux with an energy of which she might not have been believed capable	120.75836101749856
Have you been or are you his mistress	461.78584233697865
Oh no cried Milady with an accent that admitted no doubt of her truth	164.084444725497
Bonacieux but why then did you cry out so	128.2552149075407
Do you not understand said Milady who had already overcome her agitation and recovered all her presence of mind	411.0013766567495
How can I understand I know nothing	84.33528873982392
Can you not understand that Monsieur dArtagnan being my friend might take me into his confidence	208.58413586177232
Do you not perceive that I know allyour abduction from the little house at St	729.3208315132462
Germain his despair that of his friends and their useless inquiries up to this moment How could I help being astonished when without having the least expectation of such a thing I meet you face to faceyou of whom we have so often spoken together you whom he loves with all his soul you whom he had taught me to love before I had seen you Ah dear Constance I have found you then I see you at last	206.79755270564795
And Milady stretched out her arms to Mme	487.8156614464622
Bonacieux who convinced by what she had just said saw nothing in this woman whom an instant before she had believed her rival but a sincere and devoted friend	222.36738231859846
Oh pardon me pardon me cried she sinking upon the shoulders of Milady	627.3139536179232
Pardon me I love him so much	14.679515004644841
These two women held each other for an instant in a close embrace	102.42639062601049
Certainly if Miladys strength had been equal to her hatred Mme	761.0581560051099
Bonacieux would never have left that embrace alive	16629.295108366878
But not being able to stifle her she smiled upon her	220.03042385034914
Oh you beautiful good little creature said Milady	4327.893754943707
How delighted I am to have found you Let me look at you and while saying these words she absolutely devoured her by her looks	356.83588832526345
Oh yes it is you indeed From what he has told me I know you now	98.58029232072481
The poor young woman could not possibly suspect what frightful cruelty was behind the rampart of that pure brow behind those brilliant eyes in which she read nothing but interest and compassion	566.0994336092604
Then you know what I have suffered said Mme	350.4077724194444
Bonacieux since he has told you what he has suffered but to suffer for him is happiness	68.09087133178295
Milady replied mechanically Yes that is happiness	291.47574609945514
She was thinking of something else	628.9157991527013
Bonacieux my punishment is drawing to a close	193.80302065533462
Tomorrow this evening perhaps I shall see him again and then the past will no longer exist	52.95275905026322
This evening asked Milady roused from her reverie by these words	83.5504567970966
What do you mean Do you expect news from him	145.26168128865422
But that s impossible He is at the siege of La Rochelle with the cardinal	111.09172370222421
He will not return till after the taking of the city	68.48942711769442
Ah you fancy so But is there anything impossible for my DArtagnan the noble and loyal gentleman	618.8062576732186
Oh I can not believe you	10.797235227595282
Well read then said the unhappy young woman in the excess of her pride and joy presenting a letter to Milady	333.75373232566824
The writing of Madame de Chevreuse said Milady to herself	1117.316734470648
Ah I always thought there was some secret understanding in that quarter And she greedily read the following few lines	375.61276451151156
MY DEAR CHILD Hold yourself ready	245098122.77520645
Our friend will see you soon and he will only see you to release you from that imprisonment in which your safety required you should be concealed	270.6144111635708
Prepare then for your departure and never despair of us	244.9397771971514
Our charming Gascon has just proved himself as brave and faithful as ever	237.9381205768811
Tell him that certain parties are grateful for the warning he has given	99.58335518209883
Yes yes said Milady the letter is precise	522.1733696903253
Do you know what that warning was	3734.1474105974817
No I only suspect he has warned the queen against some fresh machinations of the cardinal	442.0542320121548
Yes that s it no doubt said Milady returning the letter to Mme	1029.1260272149054
Bonacieux and letting her head sink pensively upon her bosom	1036.892467562849
At that moment they heard the gallop of a horse	69.08619145084819
Bonacieux darting to the window can it be he	469.6769000115997
Milady remained still in bed petrified by surprise so many unexpected things happened to her all at once that for the first time she was at a loss	145.1199601757046
He he murmured she can it be he And she remained in bed with her eyes fixed	99.05404535054063
Bonacieux it is a man I do nt know although he seems to be coming here	90.3915100196707
Yes he checks his pace he stops at the gate he rings	347.0197792078574
You are sure it is not he said she	74.12077310220434
Perhaps you did not see well	2350.8768807511765
Oh if I were to see the plume of his hat the end of his cloak I should know him	85.8624929014357
Milady was dressing herself all the time	41.88709239909958
It is for you or me	204.69787477600008
My God how agitated you seem	394.58147319292914
I have not your confidence I fear the cardinal	127.50144057161175
Immediately the door opened and the superior entered	563.8389229943243
Did you come from Boulogne demanded she of Milady	2746.574163635538
Yes replied she trying to recover her selfpossession	1864.5441736180578
A man who will not tell his name but who comes from the cardinal	107.14240790195016
And who wishes to speak with me	8.664964878769954
Who wishes to speak to a lady recently come from Boulogne	3010.2251480224627
Then let him come in if you please	98.94326805662458
Oh my God my God cried Mme	2571.371125919356
I will leave you with this stranger but as soon as he is gone if you will permit me I will return	56.94959250706206
Milady remained alone with her eyes fixed upon the door	9.705255694603864
An instant later the jingling of spurs was heard upon the stairs steps drew near the door opened and a man appeared	63.66917997692755
Milady uttered a cry of joy this man was the Comte de Rochefortthe demoniacal tool of his Eminence	590.8909527476309
Ah cried Milady and Rochefort together it is you	301.5266940100718
Dead or desperately wounded as I left without having been able to hear anything of him	74.26409861446024
A fanatic has just assassinated him	25.970216921649747
Ah said Rochefort with a smile this is a fortunate chanceone that will delight his Eminence Have you informed him of it	412.8013609798774
I wrote to him from Boulogne	313344.01437570347
His Eminence was uneasy and sent me to find you	95.7561647539932
And what have you been doing since yesterday	863.807682973791
I have not lost my time	358.8474533001365
Oh I do nt doubt that	25.641689975200645
Do you know whom I have encountered here	321.4532441951261
That young woman whom the queen took out of prison	223.07637255962678
The mistress of that fellow DArtagnan	13531.54947226985
Yes Madame Bonacieux with whose retreat the cardinal was unacquainted	1965.8156159559223
Well well said Rochefort here is a chance which may pair off with the other Monsieur Cardinal is indeed a privileged man	300.47431552881636
Imagine my astonishment continued Milady when I found myself face to face with this woman	151.72767283859162
Then she looks upon you as a stranger	71.84967632624317
Upon my honor said Rochefort it takes you my dear countess to perform such miracles	586.1519457824178
And it is well I can Chevalier said Milady for do you know what is going on here	175.0212573476294
They will come for her tomorrow or the day after with an order from the queen	129.86598201092912
Indeed they will go so far that we shall be obliged to send them to the Bastille	44.12581420028231
Why is it not done already	9110.707232724177
What would you The cardinal has a weakness for these men which I can not comprehend	96.19636655476549
Well then tell him this Rochefort	199333.57311950377
Tell him that our conversation at the inn of the Red Dovecot was overheard by these four men tell him that after his departure one of them came up to me and took from me by violence the safeconduct which he had given me tell him they warned Lord de Winter of my journey to England that this time they nearly foiled my mission as they foiled the affair of the studs tell him that among these four men two only are to be fearedDArtagnan and Athos tell him that the third Aramis is the lover of Madame de Chevreusehe may be left alone we know his secret and it may be useful as to the fourth Porthos he is a fool a simpleton a blustering booby not worth troubling himself about	296.014529871479
But these four men must be now at the siege of La Rochelle	109.1749464035597
I thought so too but a letter which Madame Bonacieux has received from Madame the Constable and which she has had the imprudence to show me leads me to believe that these four men on the contrary are on the road hither to take her away	213.69004279727687
The devil What s to be done	53.49638805344905
What did the cardinal say about me	68.31981837904198
I was to take your dispatches written or verbal and return by post and when he shall know what you have done he will advise what you have to do	198.09639063710242
You can not take me with you	12.787399156314628
Near the camp you might be recognized and your presence you must be aware would compromise the cardinal	198.25407495429297
Then I must wait here or in the neighborhood	107.91054931575954
Only tell me beforehand where you will wait for intelligence from the cardinal let me know always where to find you	195.3649771186756
Observe it is probable that I may not be able to remain here	23.162408527724544
You forget that my enemies may arrive at any minute	366.9293402961432
That s true but is this little woman then to escape his Eminence	400.7422921486511
Bah said Milady with a smile that belonged only to herself you forget that I am her best friend	179.35084901395902
Ah that s true I may then tell the cardinal with respect to this little woman	219.3874771168542
That he may be at ease	1464.7951357692593
He will know what that means	10015.166653658383
Now then what had I better do	544.8743563005596
It appears to me that the news you bear is worth the trouble of a little diligence	269.27939334055895
My chaise broke down coming into Lilliers	4970.683346727174
And how shall I travel then	127.45623810135288
You talk very comfortablya hundred and eighty leagues	926.5505293782882
Afterward Why in passing through Lilliers you will send me your chaise with an order to your servant to place himself at my disposal	134.6862610416919
You have no doubt some order from the cardinal about you	320.25577645713486
Show it to the abbess and tell her that someone will come and fetch me either today or tomorrow and that I am to follow the person who presents himself in your name	97.41964524797476
Do nt forget to treat me harshly in speaking of me to the abbess	499.6638971117596
I am a victim of the cardinal	199.3702465379989
It is necessary to inspire confidence in that poor little Madame Bonacieux	1642.6146104299246
Now will you make me a report of all that has happened	52.01479735688856
Why I have related the events to you	98.53128110114243
You have a good memory repeat what I have told you	81.79530906750142
You are right only let me know where to find you that I may not run needlessly about the neighborhood	201.376685569035
Oh I know this country marvelously	1076778.6447318753
It is worth something you see to have been brought up somewhere	257.08611137393
You will wait for me then	106.96371267846786
Let me reflect a little Ay that will doat Armentires	8742.405057321712
A little town on the Lys I shall only have to cross the river and I shall be in a foreign country	175.87371493359592
Capital but it is understood you will only cross the river in case of danger	169.68662755999105
And in that case how shall I know where you are	30.813274703466977
You do not want your lackey	24850.83112763619
I will leave him at the place I quit and he will conduct you to me	64.32018277889807
And you say you will wait for me at Armentires	233.23660346732774
Write that name on a bit of paper lest I should forget it	149.80064942615687
There is nothing compromising in the name of a town	31.11824372578191
Eh who knows Never mind said Milady writing the name on half a sheet of paper I will compromise myself	269.57948815908765
Well said Rochefort taking the paper from Milady folding it and placing it in the lining of his hat you may be easy	243.16637262136075
I will do as children do for fear of losing the paperrepeat the name along the route	429.7910665867844
Let us see Buckingham dead or grievously wounded your conversation with the cardinal overheard by the four Musketeers Lord de Winter warned of your arrival at Portsmouth DArtagnan and Athos to the Bastille Aramis the lover of Madame de Chevreuse Porthos an ass Madame Bonacieux found again to send you the chaise as soon as possible to place my lackey at your disposal to make you out a victim of the cardinal in order that the abbess may entertain no suspicion Armentires on the banks of the Lys	450.84332436835047
In truth my dear Chevalier you are a miracle of memory	75.91141548776329
I saw some very pretty woods which almost touch the convent garden	5156.710474147151
Say that I am permitted to walk in those woods	478.5227455573386
Who knows Perhaps I shall stand in need of a back door for retreat	826.2189444021583
To ask me if I want money	212.4458057302591
I have five hundred pistoles or thereabouts	2512.978820791792
With a thousand pistoles one may face everything	3475.273276371052
In an hourtime to eat a morsel during which I shall send for a post horse	264.0507027765507
Milady and Rochefort exchanged a smile and separated	849.0240027116334
An hour afterward Rochefort set out at a grand gallop five hours after that he passed through Arras	239.20482084424088
Our readers already know how he was recognized by DArtagnan and how that recognition by inspiring fear in the four Musketeers had given fresh activity to their journey	753.5787319307027
Rochefort had scarcely departed when Mme	1723135.8094781432
She found Milady with a smiling countenance	1044.2717975674193
Well said the young woman what you dreaded has happened	342.0163397193265
This evening or tomorrow the cardinal will send someone to take you away	520.9095570400261
Who told you that my dear asked Milady	3793.4156153171602
I heard it from the mouth of the messenger himself	86.49320402401905
Come and sit down close to me said Milady	570.7639938002665
Wait till I assure myself that nobody hears us	1874.552498983412
Milady arose went to the door opened it looked in the corridor and then returned and seated herself close to Mme	127.27764619543801
Then said she he has well played his part	909.1542592745391
He who just now presented himself to the abbess as a messenger from the cardinal	95.17402531992686
It was then a part he was playing	141.82317317102374
That man said Milady lowering her voice is my brother	121.67121070665692
No one must know this secret my dear but yourself	180.6940271972098
If you reveal it to anyone in the world I shall be lost and perhaps yourself likewise	155.37060491231975
This is what has happened My brother who was coming to my assistance to take me away by force if it were necessary met with the emissary of the cardinal who was coming in search of me	115.88068206565535
At a solitary and retired part of the road he drew his sword and required the messenger to deliver up to him the papers of which he was the bearer	107.18525136270588
The messenger resisted my brother killed him	265.914530681992
Remember that was the only means	457.15408665920097
Then my brother determined to substitute cunning for force	19480.511752007675
He took the papers and presented himself here as the emissary of the cardinal and in an hour or two a carriage will come to take me away by the orders of his Eminence	111.89662241126415
It is your brother who sends this carriage	1835.6823199553567
Exactly but that is not all	112.784738545172
That letter you have received and which you believe to be from Madame de Chevreuse	85.91273966982307
Yes a forgery it is a snare to prevent your making any resistance when they come to fetch you	171.8654484881514
But it is DArtagnan that will come	137.21781939083218
DArtagnan and his friends are detained at the siege of La Rochelle	219.41355132186933
My brother met some emissaries of the cardinal in the uniform of Musketeers	155.7209247422444
You would have been summoned to the gate you would have believed yourself about to meet friends you would have been abducted and conducted back to Paris	143.97533728025448
Oh my God My senses fail me amid such a chaos of iniquities	1970.4576031349102
I feel if this continues said Mme	15439.704212414314
Bonacieux raising her hands to her forehead I shall go mad	88.53834984582079
I hear a horses steps it is my brother setting off again	709.5332900103938
I should like to offer him a last salute	404.9970992547785
Milady opened the window and made a sign to Mme	118.54347657347542
The chevalier raised his head saw the two young women and without stopping waved his hand in a friendly way to Milady	273.52227600407576
The good George said she closing the window with an expression of countenance full of affection and melancholy	73.77432382300016
And she resumed her seat as if plunged in reflections entirely personal	2160.8336150760897
Bonacieux pardon me for interrupting you but what do you advise me to do Good heaven You have more experience than I have	98.24680884610434
In the first place said Milady it is possible I may be deceived and that DArtagnan and his friends may really come to your assistance	172.5081621739367
Oh that would be too much cried Mme	2209.7534515980788
Bonacieux so much happiness is not in store for me	92.76779426391809
Then you comprehend it would be only a question of time a sort of race which should arrive first	138.91605630762515
If your friends are the more speedy you are to be saved if the satellites of the cardinal you are lost	177.692626162026
Oh yes yes lost beyond redemption What then to do What to do	1028.9392617590715
There would be a very simple means very natural	458.70628392744
To wait concealed in the neighborhood and assure yourself who are the men who come to ask for you	79.89860863505817
Oh there is no difficulty in that	25.135610924282776
I shall stop and conceal myself a few leagues hence until my brother can rejoin me	401.45213101908075
Well I take you with me we conceal ourselves and wait together	480.3335598100633
But I shall not be allowed to go I am almost a prisoner	109.73026267067024
As they believe that I go in consequence of an order from the cardinal no one will believe you anxious to follow me	170.92830725751332
Well The carriage is at the door you bid me adieu you mount the step to embrace me a last time my brothers servant who comes to fetch me is told how to proceed he makes a sign to the postillion and we set off at a gallop	211.91611542800825
But DArtagnan DArtagnan if he comes	1201.0368152782978
We will send my brothers servant back to Bthune whom as I told you we can trust	572.0611271051755
He shall assume a disguise and place himself in front of the convent	113.44229620182922
If the emissaries of the cardinal arrive he will take no notice if it is Monsieur dArtagnan and his friends he will bring them to us	124.75715560902093
Has he not seen Monsieur dArtagnan at my house	84.881869276615
Oh yes yes you are right	44.372956481660104
Thus all may go wellall may be for the best but we do not go far from this place	75.65346843829293
Seven or eight leagues at the most	30.366277524321998
We will keep on the frontiers for instance and at the first alarm we can leave France	395.47252266939216
And what can we do there	352.539562298757
My brothers carriage will be here first	438.6594214616231
If I should happen to be any distance from you when the carriage comes for youat dinner or supper for instance	388.25156226888737
Tell your good superior that in order that we may be as much together as possible you ask her permission to share my repast	178.47080788224505
Oh delightful In this way we shall not be separated for an instant	47.08822668191477
Well go down to her then to make your request	153.86539580031734
I feel my head a little confused I will take a turn in the garden	83.9633948706626
Go and where shall I find you	31.095840529502034
Oh you are so kind and I am so grateful	49.79834157771224
How can I avoid interesting myself for one who is so beautiful and so amiable Are you not the beloved of one of my best friends	92.65017279576348
Dear DArtagnan Oh how he will thank you	49.66569855809412
Now then all is agreed let us go down	32.90914759781834
You are going into the garden	45.49936995411529
Go along this corridor down a little staircase and you are in it	46.55641573777458
And the two women parted exchanging charming smiles	21151.336017071975
Milady had told the truthher head was confused for her illarranged plans clashed one another like chaos	4281.3083710984865
She required to be alone that she might put her thoughts a little into order	384.1707782393373
She saw vaguely the future but she stood in need of a little silence and quiet to give all her ideas as yet confused a distinct form and a regular plan	309.4817648874127
What was most pressing was to get Mme	1370.7564055718021
Bonacieux away and convey her to a place of safety and there if matters required make her a hostage	708.8228107703345
Milady began to have doubts of the issue of this terrible duel in which her enemies showed as much perseverance as she did animosity	310.6262621414204
Besides she felt as we feel when a storm is coming onthat this issue was near and could not fail to be terrible	351.51682159887457
The principal thing for her then was as we have said to keep Mme	217.546499625655
Bonacieux was the very life of DArtagnan	173.57428457323763
This was more than his life the life of the woman he loved this was in case of ill fortune a means of temporizing and obtaining good conditions	244.0797127225953
Now this point was settled Mme	3443536.5996155203
Bonacieux without any suspicion accompanied her	57.42128417646125
Once concealed with her at Armentires it would be easy to make her believe that DArtagnan had not come to Bthune	179.03722065648324
In fifteen days at most Rochefort would be back besides during that fifteen days she would have time to think how she could best avenge herself on the four friends	327.6528137529118
She would not be weary thank God for she should enjoy the sweetest pastime such events could accord a woman of her characterperfecting a beautiful vengeance	1193.450280648707
Revolving all this in her mind she cast her eyes around her and arranged the topography of the garden in her head	79.88835243905837
Milady was like a good general who contemplates at the same time victory and defeat and who is quite prepared according to the chances of the battle to march forward or to beat a retreat	250.99854034243188
At the end of an hour she heard a soft voice calling her it was Mme	251.97201520850808
The good abbess had naturally consented to her request and as a commencement they were to sup together	296.91932776886625
On reaching the courtyard they heard the noise of a carriage which stopped at the gate	36.693467191068535
Do you hear anything said she	104.2027936756571
Yes the rolling of a carriage	417.0057989987076
It is the one my brother sends for us	583.7425150324635
The bell of the convent gate was sounded Milady was not mistaken	1045.3234585716
Go to your chamber said she to Mme	1949.9333601855176
Bonacieux you have perhaps some jewels you would like to take	198.8157003390131
I have his letters said she	71.56502792148868
Well go and fetch them and come to my apartment	82.00716422248816
We will snatch some supper we shall perhaps travel part of the night and must keep our strength up	249.6310362765588
Bonacieux placing her hand upon her bosom my heart beats so I can not walk	104.5641544563943
Courage courage remember that in a quarter of an hour you will be safe and think that what you are about to do is for his sake	36.9370236137679
You have restored my courage by a single word go I will rejoin you	91.28371360331803
Milady ran up to her apartment quickly she there found Rocheforts lackey and gave him his instructions	1048.7561006558387
He was to wait at the gate if by chance the Musketeers should appear the carriage was to set off as fast as possible pass around the convent and go and wait for Milady at a little village which was situated at the other side of the wood	146.13904948567426
In this case Milady would cross the garden and gain the village on foot	215.48907127715958
As we have already said Milady was admirably acquainted with this part of France	656.3242001118005
If the Musketeers did not appear things were to go on as had been agreed Mme	681.4223896475976
Bonacieux was to get into the carriage as if to bid her adieu and she was to take away Mme	160.75691485803046
Bonacieux came in and to remove all suspicion if she had any Milady repeated to the lackey before her the latter part of her instructions	247.71524203838558
Milady asked some questions about the carriage	43.72467104126247
It was a chaise drawn by three horses driven by a postillion Rocheforts lackey would precede it as courier	1214.8179783596574
Milady was wrong in fearing that Mme	5807.771033836384
The poor young woman was too pure to suppose that any female could be guilty of such perfidy besides the name of the Comtesse de Winter which she had heard the abbess pronounce was wholly unknown to her and she was even ignorant that a woman had had so great and so fatal a share in the misfortune of her life	179.73963513024262
You see said she when the lackey had gone out everything is ready	395.2268059425982
The abbess suspects nothing and believes that I am taken by order of the cardinal	145.92498169844478
This man goes to give his last orders take the least thing drink a finger of wine and let us be gone	221.10981182373436
Bonacieux mechanically yes let us be gone	93.6015555802311
Milady made her a sign to sit down opposite poured her a small glass of Spanish wine and helped her to the wing of a chicken	207.88727275755025
See said she if everything does not second us Here is night coming on by daybreak we shall have reached our retreat and nobody can guess where we are	416.9348115695899
Bonacieux ate a few mouthfuls mechanically and just touched the glass with her lips	96.3006945212089
Come come said Milady lifting hers to her mouth do as I do	142.4615081274371
But at the moment the glass touched her lips her hand remained suspended she heard something on the road which sounded like the rattling of a distant gallop	299.13351971877677
Then it grew nearer and it seemed to her almost at the same time that she heard the neighing of horses	77.22237039340585
This noise acted upon her joy like the storm which awakens the sleeper in the midst of a happy dream she grew pale and ran to the window while Mme	140.68421592637964
Bonacieux rising all in a tremble supported herself upon her chair to avoid falling	1456.2163074990951
Nothing was yet to be seen only they heard the galloping draw nearer	811.591141389083
That of either our friends or our enemies said Milady with her terrible coolness	338.50606377558546
Stay where you are I will tell you	9.997392360547288
Bonacieux remained standing mute motionless and pale as a statue	40.617911406226035
The noise became louder the horses could not be more than a hundred and fifty paces distant	83.68056908056376
If they were not yet to be seen it was because the road made an elbow	205.2656630594933
The noise became so distinct that the horses might be counted by the rattle of their hoofs	157.04544844338798
Milady gazed with all the power of her attention it was just light enough for her to see who was coming	91.4264283593846
All at once at the turning of the road she saw the glitter of laced hats and the waving of feathers she counted two then five then eight horsemen	548.9512211667395
One of them preceded the rest by double the length of his horse	170.41264528431768
In the first horseman she recognized DArtagnan	4531.273896656604
Oh my God my God cried Mme	2571.371125919356
It is the uniform of the cardinals Guards	2414.5128745959387
Not an instant to be lost Fly fly	31401.978477264616
Yes yes let us fly repeated Mme	144499.87152008986
Bonacieux but without being able to make a step glued as she was to the spot by terror	154.7580125817599
They heard the horsemen pass under the windows	61.13519198778923
Come then come then cried Milady trying to drag the young woman along by the arm	347.9939284308376
Thanks to the garden we yet can flee I have the key but make haste in five minutes it will be too late	187.66848619315488
Bonacieux tried to walk made two steps and sank upon her knees	146.2315530572773
Milady tried to raise and carry her but could not do it	137.4772920878786
At this moment they heard the rolling of the carriage which at the approach of the Musketeers set off at a gallop	72.84988251906525
Then three or four shots were fired	154.4241644302179
For the last time will you come cried Milady	1740.0337508929852
Oh my God my God you see my strength fails me you see plainly I can not walk	342.68691505100566
Flee alone and leave you here No no never cried Milady	2138.243777961886
All at once she paused a livid flash darted from her eyes she ran to the table emptied into Mme	539.1195710144821
Bonacieuxs glass the contents of a ring which she opened with singular quickness	332.4625417507543
It was a grain of a reddish color which dissolved immediately	376.77912566007194
Then taking the glass with a firm hand she said Drink	405.0024261187608
This wine will give you strength drink And she put the glass to the lips of the young woman who drank mechanically	121.41733416377963
This is not the way that I wished to avenge myself said Milady replacing the glass upon the table with an infernal smile but my faith we do what we can And she rushed out of the room	125.7082144119958
Bonacieux saw her go without being able to follow her she was like people who dream they are pursued and who in vain try to walk	268.36609806325936
A few moments passed a great noise was heard at the gate	25.409267180233638
Bonacieux expected to see Milady but she did not return	47.96581826186147
Several times with terror no doubt the cold sweat burst from her burning brow	176.5676977102667
At length she heard the grating of the hinges of the opening gates the noise of boots and spurs resounded on the stairs	158.14055507571504
There was a great murmur of voices which continued to draw near amid which she seemed to hear her own name pronounced	188.9586216226462
All at once she uttered a loud cry of joy and darted toward the door she had recognized the voice of DArtagnan	57.999897194642244
DArtagnan DArtagnan cried she is it you This way this way	393.9554584815434
Constance Constance replied the young man where are you where are you My God	205.007044059879
At the same moment the door of the cell yielded to a shock rather than opened several men rushed into the chamber	330.36577569483205
Bonacieux had sunk into an armchair without the power of moving	91.33035189376737
DArtagnan threw down a yetsmoking pistol which he held in his hand and fell on his knees before his mistress	22.289474338053928
Athos replaced his in his belt Porthos and Aramis who held their drawn swords in their hands returned them to their scabbards	434.17478585234403
Oh DArtagnan my beloved DArtagnan You have come then at last You have not deceived me It is indeed thee	105.7792045473641
Oh it was in vain she told me you would not come I hoped in silence	191.21954890350887
I was not willing to fly	733.7790419959723
Oh I have done well How happy I am	314.52716254870757
At this word she Athos who had seated himself quietly started up	244.31675804521396
She who out of friendship for me wished to take me from my persecutors	148.78601858512468
She who mistaking you for the cardinals Guards has just fled away	1014.306722749676
Your companion cried DArtagnan becoming more pale than the white veil of his mistress	68.34328494343616
Of what companion are you speaking dear Constance	7251.684971123802
Of her whose carriage was at the gate of a woman who calls herself your friend of a woman to whom you have told everything	70.41108554360025
Her name her name cried DArtagnan	6227.092267146605
My God can you not remember her name	215.97934704435428
Yes it was pronounced in my hearing once	433.96044228080024
Stopbutit is very strangeoh my God my head swims I can not see	247.74195683251386
Help help my friends her hands are icy cold cried DArtagnan	3110.7357086518527
She is ill Great God she is losing her senses	481.7784194913269
While Porthos was calling for help with all the power of his strong voice Aramis ran to the table to get a glass of water but he stopped at seeing the horrible alteration that had taken place in the countenance of Athos who standing before the table his hair rising from his head his eyes fixed in stupor was looking at one of the glasses and appeared a prey to the most horrible doubt	106.78253879776871
Oh said Athos oh no it is impossible God would not permit such a crime	116.2087497548889
Oh poor woman poor woman murmured Athos in a broken voice	154.6631972166328
Bonacieux opened her eyes under the kisses of DArtagnan	245.69284133493616
She revives cried the young man	3.6683290599383542
Oh my God my God I thank thee	282.8641540216091
Madame said Athos madame in the name of heaven whose empty glass is this	134.0741656524564
Mine monsieur said the young woman in a dying voice	84.04115743017927
But who poured the wine for you that was in this glass	128.39308189455576
The four friends uttered one and the same cry but that of Athos dominated all the rest	271.3605153890155
At that moment the countenance of Mme	1027.9167624336383
Bonacieux became livid a fearful agony pervaded her frame and she sank panting into the arms of Porthos and Aramis	208.82970617847582
DArtagnan seized the hands of Athos with an anguish difficult to be described	411.7883898932686
And what do you believe His voice was stifled by sobs	474.83224932470057
I believe everything said Athos biting his lips till the blood sprang to avoid sighing	381.3851328474361
Bonacieux where art thou Do not leave me You see I am dying	46.32043484968896
DArtagnan released the hands of Athos which he still held clasped in both his own and hastened to her	230.77413423210515
Her beautiful face was distorted with agony her glassy eyes had no longer their sight a convulsive shuddering shook her whole body the sweat rolled from her brow	367.82874966081425
In the name of heaven run call Aramis Porthos Call for help	9886.394523575835
Useless said Athos useless For the poison which she pours there is no antidote	539.1096481171768
Yes yes Help help murmured Mme	1078493.8990940826
Then collecting all her strength she took the head of the young man between her hands looked at him for an instant as if her whole soul passed into that look and with a sobbing cry pressed her lips to his	89.54110121066334
A sigh escaped from the mouth of Mme	748.8468094490897
Bonacieux and dwelt for an instant on the lips of DArtagnan	31.038101881296264
That sigh was the soul so chaste and so loving which reascended to heaven	1022.362928887041
DArtagnan pressed nothing but a corpse in his arms	45.98895539393215
The young man uttered a cry and fell by the side of his mistress as pale and as icy as herself	92.93170360898651
Porthos wept Aramis pointed toward heaven Athos made the sign of the cross	156.22412724546848
At that moment a man appeared in the doorway almost as pale as those in the chamber	81.63792261619602
He looked around him and saw Mme	19129.640035991695
Bonacieux dead and DArtagnan in a swoon	1142.3161692412186
He appeared just at that moment of stupor which follows great catastrophes	1681.1983739162933
I was not deceived said he here is Monsieur dArtagnan and you are his friends Messieurs Athos Porthos and Aramis	298.6704989159687
The persons whose names were thus pronounced looked at the stranger with astonishment	142.32490510076775
It seemed to all three that they knew him	118.57489219732022
Gentlemen resumed the newcomer you are as I am in search of a woman who added he with a terrible smile must have passed this way for I see a corpse	61.669754012780444
The three friends remained mutefor although the voice as well as the countenance reminded them of someone they had seen they could not remember under what circumstances	267.18588842455495
Gentlemen continued the stranger since you do not recognize a man who probably owes his life to you twice I must name myself	94.79911731292744
I am Lord de Winter brotherinlaw of that woman	666.1791720497915
The three friends uttered a cry of surprise	10.955988139007724
Athos rose and offering him his hand Be welcome my Lord said he you are one of us	262.65442724497524
I set out five hours after her from Portsmouth said Lord de Winter	732.2836812846427
I arrived three hours after her at Boulogne	571.386948259303
I missed her by twenty minutes at St	857.7722165429808
Finally at Lilliers I lost all trace of her	128.12960485963006
I was going about at random inquiring of everybody when I saw you gallop past	1282.5194410082909
I called to you but you did not answer me I wished to follow you but my horse was too much fatigued to go at the same pace with yours	59.90771893781414
And yet it appears in spite of all your diligence you have arrived too late	144.2567911543019
You see said Athos pointing to Mme	4560.905775987357
Bonacieux dead and to DArtagnan whom Porthos and Aramis were trying to recall to life	283.58773001186483
Are they both dead asked Lord de Winter sternly	3665.7581210306016
No replied Athos fortunately Monsieur dArtagnan has only fainted	542.7822497766447
Ah indeed so much the better said Lord de Winter	237.146748618644
At that moment DArtagnan opened his eyes	5.442147550404835
He tore himself from the arms of Porthos and Aramis and threw himself like a madman on the corpse of his mistress	74.32829927102551
Athos rose walked toward his friend with a slow and solemn step embraced him tenderly and as he burst into violent sobs he said to him with his noble and persuasive voice Friend be a man Women weep for the dead men avenge them	501.0858301865958
Oh yes cried DArtagnan yes If it be to avenge her I am ready to follow you	78.87298001227991
Athos profited by this moment of strength which the hope of vengeance restored to his unfortunate friend to make a sign to Porthos and Aramis to go and fetch the superior	130.52419431447214
The two friends met her in the corridor greatly troubled and much upset by such strange events she called some of the nuns who against all monastic custom found themselves in the presence of five men	384.63742576911085
Madame said Athos passing his arm under that of DArtagnan we abandon to your pious care the body of that unfortunate woman	574.1650789348856
She was an angel on earth before being an angel in heaven	254.52499538318148
Treat her as one of your sisters	1467.8201801304026
We will return someday to pray over her grave	1827.830021810743
DArtagnan concealed his face in the bosom of Athos and sobbed aloud	224.95563297997396
Weep said Athos weep heart full of love youth and life Alas would I could weep like you	733.7502840371078
And he drew away his friend as affectionate as a father as consoling as a priest noble as a man who has suffered much	147.84009596498905
All five followed by their lackeys leading their horses took their way to the town of Bthune whose outskirts they perceived and stopped before the first inn they came to	229.17863878148466
But said DArtagnan shall we not pursue that woman	349.6422007201921
She will escape us replied the young man she will escape us and it will be your fault Athos	69.49551593401702
I will be accountable for her said Athos	364.1490054835471
DArtagnan had so much confidence in the word of his friend that he lowered his head and entered the inn without reply	80.50165990503885
Porthos and Aramis regarded each other not understanding this assurance of Athos	426.0012996923535
Lord de Winter believed he spoke in this manner to soothe the grief of DArtagnan	137.7149278753156
Now gentlemen said Athos when he had ascertained there were five chambers free in the htel let everyone retire to his own apartment	595.5149438151498
DArtagnan needs to be alone to weep and to sleep	104.89826346542705
I take charge of everything be easy	7926.8320624470925
It appears however said Lord de Winter if there are any measures to take against the countess it concerns me she is my sisterinlaw	277.75642280491195
And me said Athos she is my wife	58.867678617748595
DArtagnan smiledfor he understood that Athos was sure of his vengeance when he revealed such a secret	169.48337551286775
Porthos and Aramis looked at each other and grew pale	161.33328579956188
Lord de Winter thought Athos was mad	213.10117514309522
Now retire to your chambers said Athos and leave me to act	70.51494584115396
You must perceive that in my quality of a husband this concerns me	551.7593497882989
Only DArtagnan if you have not lost it give me the paper which fell from that mans hat upon which is written the name of the village of	94.69386734373651
Ah said DArtagnan I comprehend that name written in her hand	245.30829173291335
You see then said Athos there is a god in heaven still	222.38927416778284
THE MAN IN THE RED CLOAK	9692.01931631826
The despair of Athos had given place to a concentrated grief which only rendered more lucid the brilliant mental faculties of that extraordinary man	719.7597337282092
Possessed by one single thoughtthat of the promise he had made and of the responsibility he had takenhe retired last to his chamber begged the host to procure him a map of the province bent over it examined every line traced upon it perceived that there were four different roads from Bthune to Armentires and summoned the lackeys	465.1881960844097
Planchet Grimaud Bazin and Mousqueton presented themselves and received clear positive and serious orders from Athos	1381.4423957500442
They must set out the next morning at daybreak and go to Armentireseach by a different route	394.0660487383875
Planchet the most intelligent of the four was to follow that by which the carriage had gone upon which the four friends had fired and which was accompanied as may be remembered by Rocheforts servant	166.11799091680606
Athos set the lackeys to work first because since these men had been in the service of himself and his friends he had discovered in each of them different and essential qualities	189.41053722536336
Then lackeys who ask questions inspire less mistrust than masters and meet with more sympathy among those to whom they address themselves	1120.5806404928749
Besides Milady knew the masters and did not know the lackeys on the contrary the lackeys knew Milady perfectly	432.7108812061164
All four were to meet the next day at eleven oclock	17.217748501337326
If they had discovered Miladys retreat three were to remain on guard the fourth was to return to Bthune in order to inform Athos and serve as a guide to the four friends	253.3018458768127
These arrangements made the lackeys retired	3706.6793211695776
Athos then arose from his chair girded on his sword enveloped himself in his cloak and left the htel	223.45550048189148
At ten oclock in the evening it is well known the streets in provincial towns are very little frequented	492.28905785114273
Athos nevertheless was visibly anxious to find someone of whom he could ask a question	68.64148780937813
At length he met a belated passenger went up to him and spoke a few words to him	117.76406454667736
The man he addressed recoiled with terror and only answered the few words of the Musketeer by pointing	222.8860885574364
Athos offered the man half a pistole to accompany him but the man refused	219.21656739607093
Athos then plunged into the street the man had indicated with his finger but arriving at four crossroads he stopped again visibly embarrassed	603.8442172082229
Nevertheless as the crossroads offered him a better chance than any other place of meeting somebody he stood still	323.04990307407473
In a few minutes a night watch passed	4640.769797966758
Athos repeated to him the same question he had asked the first person he met	86.96225728791065
The night watch evinced the same terror refused in his turn to accompany Athos and only pointed with his hand to the road he was to take	127.65357871723295
Athos walked in the direction indicated and reached the suburb situated at the opposite extremity of the city from that by which he and his friends had entered it	191.1716239483498
There he again appeared uneasy and embarrassed and stopped for the third time	73.52467004942014
Fortunately a mendicant passed who coming up to Athos to ask charity Athos offered him half a crown to accompany him where he was going	360.7506104735264
The mendicant hesitated at first but at the sight of the piece of silver which shone in the darkness he consented and walked on before Athos	141.80928097123498
Arrived at the angle of a street he pointed to a small house isolated solitary and dismal	471.6405354983914
Athos went toward the house while the mendicant who had received his reward left as fast as his legs could carry him	191.98939741159936
Athos went round the house before he could distinguish the door amid the red color in which the house was painted	125.38088011999913
No light appeared through the chinks of the shutters no noise gave reason to believe that it was inhabited	256.0866612397616
It was dark and silent as the tomb	51.04932214214194
Three times Athos knocked without receiving an answer	617.5132375341007
At the third knock however steps were heard inside	1236.882828525508
The door at length was opened and a man appeared of high stature pale complexion and black hair and beard	127.20983190368185
Athos and he exchanged some words in a low voice then the tall man made a sign to the Musketeer that he might come in	46.61640492221598
Athos immediately profited by the permission and the door was closed behind him	41.57817443691114
The man whom Athos had come so far to seek and whom he had found with so much trouble introduced him into his laboratory where he was engaged in fastening together with iron wire the dry bones of a skeleton	203.42033568867456
All the frame was adjusted except the head which lay on the table	106.52493913091898
All the rest of the furniture indicated that the dweller in this house occupied himself with the study of natural science	247.90899212166192
There were large bottles filled with serpents ticketed according to their species dried lizards shone like emeralds set in great squares of black wood and bunches of wild odoriferous herbs doubtless possessed of virtues unknown to common men were fastened to the ceiling and hung down in the corners of the apartment	620.368423873956
There was no family no servant the tall man alone inhabited this house	880.952215720306
Athos cast a cold and indifferent glance upon the objects we have described and at the invitation of him whom he came to seek sat down near him	131.27800257063882
Then he explained to him the cause of his visit and the service he required of him	58.427941230480734
But scarcely had he expressed his request when the unknown who remained standing before the Musketeer drew back with signs of terror and refused	159.92025010539615
Then Athos took from his pocket a small paper on which two lines were written accompanied by a signature and a seal and presented them to him who had made too prematurely these signs of repugnance	120.34943235071502
The tall man had scarcely read these lines seen the signature and recognized the seal when he bowed to denote that he had no longer any objection to make and that he was ready to obey	149.27176118250603
He arose bowed went out returned by the same way he came reentered the htel and went to his apartment	159.79875386357978
At daybreak DArtagnan entered the chamber and demanded what was to be done	123.05628582740908
Some minutes after the superior of the convent sent to inform the Musketeers that the burial would take place at midday	242.66115196806416
As to the poisoner they had heard no tidings of her whatever only that she must have made her escape through the garden on the sand of which her footsteps could be traced and the door of which had been found shut	104.68977283616066
As to the key it had disappeared	73.50181603750805
At the hour appointed Lord de Winter and the four friends repaired to the convent the bells tolled the chapel was open the grating of the choir was closed	262.09334680809894
In the middle of the choir the body of the victim clothed in her novitiate dress was exposed	905.247940552246
On each side of the choir and behind the gratings opening into the convent was assembled the whole community of the Carmelites who listened to the divine service and mingled their chant with the chant of the priests without seeing the profane or being seen by them	329.25774174986884
At the door of the chapel DArtagnan felt his courage fall anew and returned to look for Athos but Athos had disappeared	1087.4159247115565
Faithful to his mission of vengeance Athos had requested to be conducted to the garden and there upon the sand following the light steps of this woman who left sharp tracks wherever she went he advanced toward the gate which led into the wood and causing it to be opened he went out into the forest	218.44327749491106
Then all his suspicions were confirmed the road by which the carriage had disappeared encircled the forest	177.60579558688633
Athos followed the road for some time his eyes fixed upon the ground slight stains of blood which came from the wound inflicted upon the man who accompanied the carriage as a courier or from one of the horses dotted the road	135.70722195031072
At the end of threequarters of a league within fifty paces of Festubert a larger bloodstain appeared the ground was trampled by horses	554.6632629872912
Between the forest and this accursed spot a little behind the trampled ground was the same track of small feet as in the garden the carriage had stopped here	313.4112761153671
At this spot Milady had come out of the wood and entered the carriage	42.46963472745644
Satisfied with this discovery which confirmed all his suspicions Athos returned to the htel and found Planchet impatiently waiting for him	573.0162927770947
Everything was as Athos had foreseen	1269.8694613324838
Planchet had followed the road like Athos he had discovered the stains of blood like Athos he had noted the spot where the horses had halted	305.18674544342144
But he had gone farther than Athosfor at the village of Festubert while drinking at an inn he had learned without needing to ask a question that the evening before at halfpast eight a wounded man who accompanied a lady traveling in a postchaise had been obliged to stop unable to go further	302.22869585660027
The accident was set down to the account of robbers who had stopped the chaise in the wood	146.25317321508933
The man remained in the village the woman had had a relay of horses and continued her journey	379.3218944138322
Planchet went in search of the postillion who had driven her and found him	152.15321181547182
He had taken the lady as far as Fromelles and from Fromelles she had set out for Armentires	492.96419325679943
Planchet took the crossroad and by seven oclock in the morning he was at Armentires	83.50416430211055
There was but one tavern the Post	2660.506281787823
Planchet went and presented himself as a lackey out of a place who was in search of a situation	117.15087237868677
He had not chatted ten minutes with the people of the tavern before he learned that a woman had come there alone about eleven oclock the night before had engaged a chamber had sent for the master of the htel and told him she desired to remain some time in the neighborhood	123.42704403757622
Planchet had no need to learn more	936.2662319020336
He hastened to the rendezvous found the lackeys at their posts placed them as sentinels at all the outlets of the htel and came to find Athos who had just received this information when his friends returned	306.83096745782063
All their countenances were melancholy and gloomy even the mild countenance of Aramis	230.25403465547583
What is to be done asked DArtagnan	329.77985204020814
Each retired to his own apartment	147.95895300661
At eight oclock in the evening Athos ordered the horses to be saddled and Lord de Winter and his friends notified that they must prepare for the expedition	348.0577798074134
In an instant all five were ready	965.5669803196354
Each examined his arms and put them in order	191.8940629486963
Athos came down last and found DArtagnan already on horseback and growing impatient	1357.5463023285233
Patience cried Athos one of our party is still wanting	123.30911209131413
The four horsemen looked round them with astonishment for they sought vainly in their minds to know who this other person could be	237.18724616081494
At this moment Planchet brought out Athoss horse the Musketeer leaped lightly into the saddle	765.2868451709955
Wait for me cried he I will soon be back and he set off at a gallop	87.48704461931557
In a quarter of an hour he returned accompanied by a tall man masked and wrapped in a large red cloak	147.23219794955634
Lord de Winter and the three Musketeers looked at one another inquiringly	796.2703191072151
Neither could give the others any information for all were ignorant who this man could be nevertheless they felt convinced that all was as it should be as it was done by the order of Athos	166.55458085327416
At nine oclock guided by Planchet the little cavalcade set out taking the route the carriage had taken	487.12259582344655
It was a melancholy sightthat of these six men traveling in silence each plunged in his own thoughts sad as despair gloomy as chastisement	915.3180399990187
It was a stormy and dark night vast clouds covered the heavens concealing the stars the moon would not rise till midnight	938.8813334048607
Occasionally by the light of a flash of lightning which gleamed along the horizon the road stretched itself before them white and solitary the flash extinct all remained in darkness	572.7633223502723
Every minute Athos was forced to restrain DArtagnan constantly in advance of the little troop and to beg him to keep in the line which in an instant he again departed from	169.53942878532678
He had but one thoughtto go forward and he went	231.4811938919056
They passed in silence through the little village of Festubert where the wounded servant was and then skirted the wood of Richebourg	563.9609337593686
At Herlier Planchet who led the column turned to the left	192.60314520990775
Several times Lord de Winter Porthos or Aramis tried to talk with the man in the red cloak but to every interrogation which they put to him he bowed without response	402.0260686111561
The travelers then comprehended that there must be some reason why the unknown preserved such a silence and ceased to address themselves to him	201.00766947167295
The storm increased the flashes succeeded one another more rapidly the thunder began to growl and the wind the precursor of a hurricane whistled in the plumes and the hair of the horsemen	259.016087778792
The cavalcade trotted on more sharply	37791.90612434501
A little before they came to Fromelles the storm burst	823.7696648075847
There remained three leagues to travel and they did it amid torrents of rain	727.5121185969936
DArtagnan took off his hat and could not be persuaded to make use of his cloak	72.71086238187624
He found pleasure in feeling the water trickle over his burning brow and over his body agitated by feverish shudders	423.8979728741464
The moment the little troop passed Goskal and were approaching the Post a man sheltered beneath a tree detached himself from the trunk with which he had been confounded in the darkness and advanced into the middle of the road putting his finger on his lips	175.25241443333624
What s the manner cried Athos	9669.972075364893
Grimaud made a sign in the affirmative	19.951825519807525
I have charged myself with this affair	49.02247712079735
It is for me then to interrogate Grimaud	6380.490889764469
Grimaud extended his hands in the direction of the Lys	47.39492103828441
Grimaud showed his master his forefinger bent	16677.64778686049
Gentlemen said Athos she is alone within half a league of us in the direction of the river	104.77563849739788
Grimaud took his course across the country and acted as guide to the cavalcade	279.33436904890584
At the end of five hundred paces more or less they came to a rivulet which they forded	484.28445237026887
By the aid of the lightning they perceived the village of Erquinheim	579.1515237370003
Is she there Grimaud asked Athos	2762.9550414879373
And the troop continued their route	13504.682802846266
Another flash illuminated all around them	57.08663174375544
Grimaud extended his arm and by the bluish splendor of the fiery serpent they distinguished a little isolated house on the banks of the river within a hundred paces of a ferry	245.44294299355934
At this moment a man who had been crouching in a ditch jumped up and came towards them	167.67858541297582
He pointed his finger to the lighted window	709.6011328148302
While I watched the window he guarded the door	98.30607542839047
You are good and faithful servants	1359.7024029471922
Athos sprang from his horse gave the bridle to Grimaud and advanced toward the window after having made a sign to the rest of the troop to go toward the door	63.85431390349788
The little house was surrounded by a low quickset hedge two or three feet high	213.8450008908903
Athos sprang over the hedge and went up to the window which was without shutters but had the halfcurtains closely drawn	215.03972047995254
He mounted the skirting stone that his eyes might look over the curtain	132.8151194182786
By the light of a lamp he saw a woman wrapped in a dark mantle seated upon a stool near a dying fire	174.76257405677853
Her elbows were placed upon a mean table and she leaned her head upon her two hands which were white as ivory	237.86590776206776
He could not distinguish her countenance but a sinister smile passed over the lips of Athos	77.67937288013904
He was not deceived it was she whom he sought	102.55564663190796
At this moment a horse neighed	434349.8219587074
Milady raised her head saw close to the panes the pale face of Athos and screamed	332.1044729114963
Athos perceiving that she knew him pushed the window with his knee and hand	102.21138949584359
The squares were broken to shivers and Athos like the spectre of vengeance leaped into the room	238.0930325218519
Milady rushed to the door and opened it	12.016860681893096
More pale and menacing than Athos DArtagnan stood on the threshold	377.45758661445603
DArtagnan believing she might have means of flight and fearing she should escape drew a pistol from his belt but Athos raised his hand	190.88962630055005
Put back that weapon DArtagnan said he this woman must be tried not assassinated	156.60299851483742
Wait an instant my friend and you shall be satisfied	24.012445283207498
DArtagnan obeyed for Athos had the solemn voice and the powerful gesture of a judge sent by the Lord himself	231.96735009673282
Behind DArtagnan entered Porthos Aramis Lord de Winter and the man in the red cloak	101.23866316839111
The four lackeys guarded the door and the window	33.748160267077175
Milady had sunk into a chair with her hands extended as if to conjure this terrible apparition	113.9190764081587
Perceiving her brotherinlaw she uttered a terrible cry	42.5903830746243
What do you want screamed Milady	215247.30953897137
We want said Athos Charlotte Backson who first was called Comtesse de la Fre and afterwards Milady de Winter Baroness of Sheffield	1896.8089821668239
That is I that is I murmured Milady in extreme terror what do you want	389.136930970766
We wish to judge you according to your crime said Athos you shall be free to defend yourself	111.9456266888019
dArtagnan it is for you to accuse her first	273.1053338929324
Before God and before men said he I accuse this woman of having poisoned Constance Bonacieux who died yesterday evening	1009.5368875367197
He turned towards Porthos and Aramis	562.5322594196093
We bear witness to this said the two Musketeers with one voice	394.84095165421616
DArtagnan continued Before God and before men I accuse this woman of having attempted to poison me in wine which she sent me from Villeroy with a forged letter as if that wine came from my friends	424.2197239783244
God preserved me but a man named Brisemont died in my place	293.2374604369083
We bear witness to this said Porthos and Aramis in the same manner as before	68.91322112445687
Before God and before men I accuse this woman of having urged me to the murder of the Baron de Wardes but as no one else can attest the truth of this accusation I attest it myself	257.63365959121654
And DArtagnan passed to the other side of the room with Porthos and Aramis	48.98698125676516
Your turn my Lord said Athos	3315.7989878969106
Before God and before men said he I accuse this woman of having caused the assassination of the Duke of Buckingham	150.42589789073492
The Duke of Buckingham assassinated cried all present with one voice	3416.346514852705
On receiving the warning letter you wrote to me I had this woman arrested and gave her in charge to a loyal servant	224.21427354636313
She corrupted this man she placed the poniard in his hand she made him kill the duke	170.58632216923723
And at this moment perhaps Felton is paying with his head for the crime of this fury	286.47989867350657
A shudder crept through the judges at the revelation of these unknown crimes	545.4411946774019
That is not all resumed Lord de Winter	1542.3863434758848
My brother who made you his heir died in three hours of a strange disorder which left livid traces all over the body	251.27027181079805
My sister how did your husband die	1692.5877393584149
Assassin of Buckingham assassin of Felton assassin of my brother I demand justice upon you and I swear that if it be not granted to me I will execute it myself	141.9681026113118
And Lord de Winter ranged himself by the side of DArtagnan leaving the place free for another accuser	212.13213484326243
Milady let her head sink between her two hands and tried to recall her ideas whirling in a mortal vertigo	334.2445582246857
My turn said Athos himself trembling as the lion trembles at the sight of the serpentmy turn	351.0317759953853
I married that woman when she was a young girl I married her in opposition to the wishes of all my family I gave her my wealth I gave her my name and one day I discovered that this woman was brandedthis woman was marked with a fleurdelis on her left shoulder	121.66125852973587
Oh said Milady raising herself I defy you to find any tribunal which pronounced that infamous sentence against me	826.5837131124239
I defy you to find him who executed it	187.44138964436863
It is for me to reply to that And the man in the red cloak came forward in his turn	131.60640000772707
What man is that What man is that cried Milady suffocated by terror her hair loosening itself and rising above her livid countenance as if alive	608.9805220893667
All eyes were turned towards this manfor to all except Athos he was unknown	1311.9854301891546
Even Athos looked at him with as much stupefaction as the others for he knew not how he could in any way find himself mixed up with the horrible drama then unfolded	236.94535195853507
After approaching Milady with a slow and solemn step so that the table alone separated them the unknown took off his mask	265.20762439448924
Milady for some time examined with increasing terror that pale face framed with black hair and whiskers the only expression of which was icy impassibility	221.09978347667015
Then she suddenly cried Oh no no rising and retreating to the very wall	601.6858651829112
No no it is an infernal apparition It is not he Help help screamed she turning towards the wall as if she would tear an opening with her hands	415.1730559396594
Who are you then cried all the witnesses of this scene	114.1408752772888
Ask that woman said the man in the red cloak for you may plainly see she knows me	275.6960346097145
The executioner of Lille the executioner of Lille cried Milady a prey to insensate terror and clinging with her hands to the wall to avoid falling	583.1595468390785
Everyone drew back and the man in the red cloak remained standing alone in the middle of the room	66.42217415444725
Oh grace grace pardon cried the wretch falling on her knees	46.29919581738312
The unknown waited for silence and then resumed I told you well that she would know me	80.06001878504804
Yes I am the executioner of Lille and this is my history	240.7765925093387
All eyes were fixed upon this man whose words were listened to with anxious attention	241.04950491121596
That woman was once a young girl as beautiful as she is today	77.82100357671453
She was a nun in the convent of the Benedictines of Templemar	144.07442652945954
A young priest with a simple and trustful heart performed the duties of the church of that convent	492.8692183300216
She undertook his seduction and succeeded she would have seduced a saint	1069.8294826048696
Their vows were sacred and irrevocable	433951.1032524778
Their connection could not last long without ruining both	3553.363862000578
She prevailed upon him to leave the country but to leave the country to fly together to reach another part of France where they might live at ease because unknown money was necessary	234.04120119145784
The priest stole the sacred vases and sold them but as they were preparing to escape together they were both arrested	216.16966496084328
Eight days later she had seduced the son of the jailer and escaped	244.49654697200194
The young priest was condemned to ten years of imprisonment and to be branded	261.27274046773124
I was executioner of the city of Lille as this woman has said	325.7314786623167
I was obliged to brand the guilty one and he gentlemen was my brother	393.54060630488567
I then swore that this woman who had ruined him who was more than his accomplice since she had urged him to the crime should at least share his punishment	151.25784132313652
I suspected where she was concealed	1691.673554799304
I followed her I caught her I bound her and I imprinted the same disgraceful mark upon her that I had imprinted upon my poor brother	344.25992876569114
The day after my return to Lille my brother in his turn succeeded in making his escape I was accused of complicity and was condemned to remain in his place till he should be again a prisoner	134.68089397785502
My poor brother was ignorant of this sentence	253.4307487957709
He rejoined this woman they fled together into Berry and there he obtained a little curacy	1174.628410491998
This woman passed for his sister	269.6246049832488
The Lord of the estate on which the chapel of the curacy was situated saw this pretend sister and became enamoured of heramorous to such a degree that he proposed to marry her	434.093611322244
Then she quitted him she had ruined for him she was destined to ruin and became the Comtesse de la Fre	184.09782058841986
All eyes were turned towards Athos whose real name that was and who made a sign with his head that all was true which the executioner had said	105.44208309337408
Then resumed he mad desperate determined to get rid of an existence from which she had stolen everything honor and happiness my poor brother returned to Lille and learning the sentence which had condemned me in his place surrendered himself and hanged himself that same night from the iron bar of the loophole of his prison	273.1032329569806
To do justice to them who had condemned me they kept their word	238.74581121709667
As soon as the identity of my brother was proved I was set at liberty	132.29494841990092
That is the crime of which I accuse her that is the cause for which she was branded	183.81391808354437
Monsieur dArtagnan said Athos what is the penalty you demand against this woman	242.47822942961292
The punishment of death replied DArtagnan	1452.0611479388538
My Lord de Winter continued Athos what is the penalty you demand against this woman	430.13323962935607
The punishment of death replied Lord de Winter	936.493351912957
Messieurs Porthos and Aramis repeated Athos you who are her judges what is the sentence you pronounce upon this woman	487.30793186296523
The punishment of death replied the Musketeers in a hollow voice	153.35075557787349
Milady uttered a frightful shriek and dragged herself along several paces upon her knees toward her judges	341.12677124258977
Athos stretched out his hand toward her	94.72097900114092
Charlotte Backson Comtesse de la Fre Milady de Winter said he your crimes have wearied men on earth and God in heaven	835.1515075670839
If you know a prayer say itfor you are condemned and you shall die	227.92122383657767
At these words which left no hope Milady raised herself in all her pride and wished to speak but her strength failed her	241.8123408928282
She felt that a powerful and implacable hand seized her by the hair and dragged her away as irrevocably as fatality drags humanity	896.6126608698179
She did not therefore even attempt the least resistance and went out of the cottage	211.64477947103
Lord de Winter DArtagnan Athos Porthos and Aramis went out close behind her	263.32920192694894
The lackeys followed their masters and the chamber was left solitary with its broken window its open door and its smoky lamp burning sadly on the table	388.81973405159664
It was near midnight the moon lessened by its decline and reddened by the last traces of the storm arose behind the little town of Armentires which showed against its pale light the dark outline of its houses and the skeleton of its high belfry	297.6863250330948
In front of them the Lys rolled its waters like a river of molten tin while on the other side was a black mass of trees profiled on a stormy sky invaded by large coppery clouds which created a sort of twilight amid the night	418.1116311635629
On the left was an old abandoned mill with its motionless wings from the ruins of which an owl threw out its shrill periodical and monotonous cry	1017.6660922471978
On the right and on the left of the road which the dismal procession pursued appeared a few low stunted trees which looked like deformed dwarfs crouching down to watch men traveling at this sinister hour	791.3980009360749
From time to time a broad sheet of lightning opened the horizon in its whole width darted like a serpent over the black mass of trees and like a terrible scimitar divided the heavens and the waters into two parts	322.68926562635704
Not a breath of wind now disturbed the heavy atmosphere	607.9807428398063
A deathlike silence oppressed all nature	5908.092005418243
The soil was humid and glittering with the rain which had recently fallen and the refreshed herbs sent forth their perfume with additional energy	755.7574614871577
Two lackeys dragged Milady whom each held by one arm	248.31150078684496
The executioner walked behind them and Lord de Winter DArtagnan Porthos and Aramis walked behind the executioner	670.8336077464975
The two lackeys conducted Milady to the bank of the river	32.891605989792026
Her mouth was mute but her eyes spoke with their inexpressible eloquence supplicating by turns each of those on whom she looked	563.2802222837973
Being a few paces in advance she whispered to the lackeys A thousand pistoles to each of you if you will assist my escape but if you deliver me up to your masters I have near at hand avengers who will make you pay dearly for my death	180.94345245111734
Mousqueton trembled in all his members	3094.8704770387326
Athos who heard Miladys voice came sharply up	4381.348395190891
Lord de Winter did the same	12.056135700605505
Change these lackeys said he she has spoken to them	69.27602313265898
Planchet and Bazin were called and took the places of Grimaud and Mousqueton	205.90529203589645
On the bank of the river the executioner approached Milady and bound her hands and feet	618.447123367125
Then she broke the silence to cry out You are cowards miserable assassinsten men combined to murder one woman	1193.6397286680167
Beware If I am not saved I shall be avenged	143.03749165232898
You are not a woman said Athos coldly and sternly	927.1170193108113
You do not belong to the human species you are a demon escaped from hell whither we send you back again	496.7369040916917
Ah you virtuous men said Milady please to remember that he who shall touch a hair of my head is himself an assassin	413.8811477358255
The executioner may kill without being on that account an assassin said the man in the red cloak rapping upon his immense sword	220.67450602714106
This is the last judge that is all	63.15227165365588
Nachrichter as say our neighbors the Germans	3630.739825754381
And as he bound her while saying these words Milady uttered two or three savage cries which produced a strange and melancholy effect in flying away into the night and losing themselves in the depths of the woods	320.9964560155887
If I am guilty if I have committed the crimes you accuse me of shrieked Milady take me before a tribunal	293.12171367981745
You are not judges You can not condemn me	60.16262112679572
I offered you Tyburn said Lord de Winter	1306.9188144917557
Why did you not accept it	23.11271194283689
Because I am not willing to die cried Milady struggling	1621.0005012948902
Because I am too young to die	94.16191607833557
The woman you poisoned at Bthune was still younger than you madame and yet she is dead said DArtagnan	315.5792667857293
I will enter a cloister I will become a nun said Milady	495.81100187638236
You were in a cloister said the executioner and you left it to ruin my brother	86.92465631873489
Milady uttered a cry of terror and sank upon her knees	51.29215768317452
The executioner took her up in his arms and was carrying her toward the boat	97.056146681295
Oh my God cried she my God are you going to drown me	72.85504706827045
These cries had something so heartrending in them that M	333.962231861936
dArtagnan who had been at first the most eager in pursuit of Milady sat down on the stump of a tree and hung his head covering his ears with the palms of his hands and yet notwithstanding he could still hear her cry and threaten	185.69317508297823
DArtagnan was the youngest of all these men	55.556596147273694
Oh I can not behold this frightful spectacle said he	215.01170995067648
I can not consent that this woman should die thus	164.89427769284904
Milady heard these few words and caught at a shadow of hope	167.81799853562046
DArtagnan DArtagnan cried she remember that I loved you	20.235215217165333
The young man rose and took a step toward her	74.64237873877714
But Athos rose likewise drew his sword and placed himself in the way	24.057347772509296
If you take one step farther DArtagnan said he we shall cross swords together	828.5053773044315
DArtagnan sank on his knees and prayed	123.86805997104622
Come continued Athos executioner do your duty	73.96860328418002
Willingly monseigneur said the executioner for as I am a good Catholic I firmly believe I am acting justly in performing my functions on this woman	595.657780011054
Athos made a step toward Milady	9522991.486986669
I pardon you said he the ill you have done me	121.45699733342893
I pardon you for my blasted future my lost honor my defiled love and my salvation forever compromised by the despair into which you have cast me	988.9508304534623
Lord de Winter advanced in his turn	22.944184562757854
I pardon you said he for the poisoning of my brother and the assassination of his Grace Lord Buckingham	489.17429794783453
I pardon you for the death of poor Felton I pardon you for the attempts upon my own person	210.56265531347069
Pardon me madame for having by a trick unworthy of a gentleman provoked your anger and I in exchange pardon you the murder of my poor love and your cruel vengeance against me	271.2883973984242
I pardon you and I weep for you	301.41514803211913
I am lost murmured Milady in English	875.634977907759
Then she arose of herself and cast around her one of those piercing looks which seemed to dart from an eye of flame	304.1498814992273
She saw nothing she listened and she heard nothing	69.37899030521393
Where am I to die said she	22.829684757359445
On the other bank replied the executioner	191.7205617209888
Then he placed her in the boat and as he was going to set foot in it himself Athos handed him a sum of silver	125.93341800900579
Here said he is the price of the execution that it may be plain we act as judges	411.6306442885501
That is correct said the executioner and now in her turn let this woman see that I am not fulfilling my trade but my debt	213.8195725483852
And he threw the money into the river	23.820353690082154
The boat moved off toward the lefthand shore of the Lys bearing the guilty woman and the executioner all the others remained on the righthand bank where they fell on their knees	200.62242268482282
The boat glided along the ferry rope under the shadow of a pale cloud which hung over the water at that moment	140.9695218424557
The troop of friends saw it gain the opposite bank the figures were defined like black shadows on the redtinted horizon	807.72585675157
Milady during the passage had contrived to untie the cord which fastened her feet	423.75557353886785
On coming near the bank she jumped lightly on shore and took to flight	438.73712304719726
But the soil was moist on reaching the top of the bank she slipped and fell upon her knees	72.74731506775984
She was struck no doubt with a superstitious idea she conceived that heaven denied its aid and she remained in the attitude in which she had fallen her head drooping and her hands clasped	309.91773565706274
Then they saw from the other bank the executioner raise both his arms slowly a moonbeam fell upon the blade of the large sword	509.149938581859
The two arms fell with a sudden force they heard the hissing of the scimitar and the cry of the victim then a truncated mass sank beneath the blow	258.59199261708716
The executioner then took off his red cloak spread it upon the ground laid the body in it threw in the head tied all up by the four corners lifted it on his back and entered the boat again	232.74201783293324
In the middle of the stream he stopped the boat and suspending his burden over the water cried in a loud voice Let the justice of God be done and he let the corpse drop into the depths of the waters which closed over it	188.34312299165393
Three days afterward the four Musketeers were in Paris they had not exceeded their leave of absence and that same evening they went to pay their customary visit to M	202.1576333500076
Well gentlemen said the brave captain I hope you have been well amused during your excursion	254.5296430320832
Prodigiously replied Athos in the name of himself and his comrades	127.74796801559216
On the sixth of the following month the king in compliance with the promise he had made the cardinal to return to La Rochelle left his capital still in amazement at the news which began to spread itself of Buckinghams assassination	293.0691701043572
Although warned that the man she had loved so much was in great danger the queen when his death was announced to her would not believe the fact and even imprudently exclaimed it is false he has just written to me	163.6923987417163
But the next day she was obliged to believe this fatal intelligence Laporte detained in England as everyone else had been by the orders of Charles I	258.0885182175682
arrived and was the bearer of the dukes dying gift to the queen	354.9368235671116
The joy of the king was lively	2232.0968122736176
He did not even give himself the trouble to dissemble and displayed it with affectation before the queen	375.1342341959199
like every weak mind was wanting in generosity	1185.6969905012493
But the king soon again became dull and indisposed his brow was not one of those that long remain clear	368.7984593022373
He felt that in returning to camp he should reenter slavery nevertheless he did return	1987.7325699212245
The cardinal was for him the fascinating serpent and himself the bird which flies from branch to branch without power to escape	987.5500438379357
The return to La Rochelle therefore was profoundly dull	4121.115845429553
Our four friends in particular astonished their comrades they traveled together side by side with sad eyes and heads lowered	2156.782584448699
Athos alone from time to time raised his expansive brow a flash kindled in his eyes and a bitter smile passed over his lips then like his comrades he sank again into reverie	192.00159592026392
As soon as the escort arrived in a city when they had conducted the king to his quarters the four friends either retired to their own or to some secluded cabaret where they neither drank nor played they only conversed in a low voice looking around attentively to see that no one overheard them	238.7148463662546
One day when the king had halted to fly the magpie and the four friends according to their custom instead of following the sport had stopped at a cabaret on the high road a man coming from la Rochelle on horseback pulled up at the door to drink a glass of wine and darted a searching glance into the room where the four Musketeers were sitting	187.1187589017483
Holloa Monsieur dArtagnan said he is not that you whom I see yonder	238.1394371738746
DArtagnan raised his head and uttered a cry of joy	15.033922501124964
It was the man he called his phantom it was his stranger of Meung of the Rue des Fossoyeurs and of Arras	396.4905170870188
DArtagnan drew his sword and sprang toward the door	49.78810140726263
But this time instead of avoiding him the stranger jumped from his horse and advanced to meet DArtagnan	235.81756388142134
Ah monsieur said the young man I meet you then at last This time you shall not escape me	68.84818592295737
Neither is it my intention monsieur for this time I was seeking you in the name of the king I arrest you	74.37804335844937
How what do you say cried DArtagnan	1932.5396720841845
I say that you must surrender your sword to me monsieur and that without resistance	374.12433159465405
This concerns your head I warn you	49.43320112043783
Who are you then demanded DArtagnan lowering the point of his sword but without yet surrendering it	536.5788701138483
I am the Chevalier de Rochefort answered the other the equerry of Monsieur le Cardinal Richelieu and I have orders to conduct you to his Eminence	317.19653071816583
We are returning to his Eminence monsieur the Chevalier said Athos advancing and you will please to accept the word of Monsieur dArtagnan that he will go straight to La Rochelle	384.6030118599718
I must place him in the hands of guards who will take him into camp	147.3341498424927
We will be his guards monsieur upon our word as gentlemen but likewise upon our word as gentlemen added Athos knitting his brow Monsieur dArtagnan shall not leave us	1044.2439388084053
The Chevalier de Rochefort cast a glance backward and saw that Porthos and Aramis had placed themselves between him and the gate he understood that he was completely at the mercy of these four men	116.49056807895532
Gentlemen said he if Monsieur dArtagnan will surrender his sword to me and join his word to yours I shall be satisfied with your promise to convey Monsieur dArtagnan to the quarters of Monseigneur the Cardinal	197.00118595706493
You have my word monsieur and here is my sword	222.92738578075551
This suits me the better said Rochefort as I wish to continue my journey	133.7005339739289
If it is for the purpose of rejoining Milady said Athos coolly it is useless you will not find her	377.1215752772536
What has become of her then asked Rochefort eagerly	1958.8595144506103
Return to camp and you shall know	38.14515184589624
Rochefort remained for a moment in thought then as they were only a days journey from Surgres whither the cardinal was to come to meet the king he resolved to follow the advice of Athos and go with them	146.10514330482877
Besides this return offered him the advantage of watching his prisoner	125.92878976087178
On the morrow at three oclock in the afternoon they arrived at Surgres	63.751431213226546
The cardinal there awaited Louis XIII	202.37549827157994
The minister and the king exchanged numerous caresses felicitating each other upon the fortunate chance which had freed France from the inveterate enemy who set all Europe against her	1109.7681711880068
After which the cardinal who had been informed that DArtagnan was arrested and who was anxious to see him took leave of the king inviting him to come the next day to view the work already done upon the dyke	134.94450591304738
On returning in the evening to his quarters at the bridge of La Pierre the cardinal found standing before the house he occupied DArtagnan without his sword and the three Musketeers armed	380.5012768992878
This time as he was well attended he looked at them sternly and made a sign with his eye and hand for DArtagnan to follow him	194.47411428272244
We shall wait for you DArtagnan said Athos loud enough for the cardinal to hear him	422.69684019546855
His Eminence bent his brow stopped for an instant and then kept on his way without uttering a single word	78.0912309724437
DArtagnan entered after the cardinal and behind DArtagnan the door was guarded	568.5441404450111
His Eminence entered the chamber which served him as a study and made a sign to Rochefort to bring in the young Musketeer	130.69289947474192
DArtagnan remained alone in front of the cardinal this was his second interview with Richelieu and he afterward confessed that he felt well assured it would be his last	270.51989480869065
Richelieu remained standing leaning against the mantelpiece a table was between him and DArtagnan	247.4105620932037
Monsieur said the cardinal you have been arrested by my orders	54.18569685107583
No monseigneur for the only thing for which I could be arrested is still unknown to your Eminence	146.4844560158022
Richelieu looked steadfastly at the young man	13.882847449569079
Holloa said he what does that mean	213.4872024184389
If Monseigneur will have the goodness to tell me in the first place what crimes are imputed to me I will then tell him the deeds I have really done	107.65945799731244
Crimes are imputed to you which had brought down far loftier heads than yours monsieur said the cardinal	776.0298813380859
What monseigneur said DArtagnan with a calmness which astonished the cardinal himself	159.74744267060757
You are charged with having corresponded with the enemies of the kingdom you are charged with having surprised state secrets you are charged with having tried to thwart the plans of your general	276.07519238093283
And who charges me with this monseigneur said DArtagnan who had no doubt the accusation came from Milady a woman branded by the justice of the country a woman who has espoused one man in France and another in England a woman who poisoned her second husband and who attempted both to poison and assassinate me	293.39960339773785
What do you say monsieur cried the cardinal astonished and of what woman are you speaking thus	260.5341141770747
Of Milady de Winter replied DArtagnan yes of Milady de Winter of whose crimes your Eminence is doubtless ignorant since you have honored her with your confidence	570.382723998513
Monsieur said the cardinal if Milady de Winter has committed the crimes you lay to her charge she shall be punished	597.6777140780165
Dead repeated the cardinal who could not believe what he heard dead Did you not say she was dead	99.81334664450219
Three times she attempted to kill me and I pardoned her but she murdered the woman I loved	201.4187982926471
Then my friends and I took her tried her and condemned her	251.9509566006415
DArtagnan then related the poisoning of Mme	528.8156568656888
Bonacieux in the convent of the Carmelites at Bthune the trial in the isolated house and the execution on the banks of the Lys	212.51093560462462
A shudder crept through the body of the cardinal who did not shudder readily	173.7467478771066
But all at once as if undergoing the influence of an unspoken thought the countenance of the cardinal till then gloomy cleared up by degrees and recovered perfect serenity	689.600442245296
So said the cardinal in a tone that contrasted strongly with the severity of his words you have constituted yourselves judges without remembering that they who punish without license to punish are assassins	941.2023076856008
Monseigneur I swear to you that I never for an instant had the intention of defending my head against you	128.59311868463806
I willingly submit to any punishment your Eminence may please to inflict upon me	887.3309944036411
I do not hold life dear enough to be afraid of death	145.46719267323888
Yes I know you are a man of a stout heart monsieur said the cardinal with a voice almost affectionate I can therefore tell you beforehand you shall be tried and even condemned	146.8966388253688
Another might reply to your Eminence that he had his pardon in his pocket	203.802937290937
I content myself with saying Command monseigneur I am ready	1682.070208124606
And signed by whomby the king And the cardinal pronounced these words with a singular expression of contempt	146.61914423345908
By me You are insane monsieur	22480.67862268949
Monseigneur will doubtless recognize his own handwriting	1542.2493075236523
And DArtagnan presented to the cardinal the precious piece of paper which Athos had forced from Milady and which he had given to DArtagnan to serve him as a safeguard	179.90217503615742
His Eminence took the paper and read in a slow voice dwelling upon every syllable	417.7417573502003
It is by my order and for the good of the state that the bearer of this has done what he has done	85.04559503719429
The cardinal after having read these two lines sank into a profound reverie but he did not return the paper to DArtagnan	138.3171248673983
He is meditating by what sort of punishment he shall cause me to die said the Gascon to himself	120.61424254953269
Well my faith he shall see how a gentleman can die	200.08665735650158
The young Musketeer was in excellent disposition to die heroically	2694.1197048533318
Richelieu still continued thinking rolling and unrolling the paper in his hands	78.96509493026312
At length he raised his head fixed his eagle look upon that loyal open and intelligent countenance read upon that face furrowed with tears all the sufferings its possessor had endured in the course of a month and reflected for the third or fourth time how much there was in that youth of twentyone years before him and what resources his activity his courage and his shrewdness might offer to a good master	384.15153699124954
On the other side the crimes the power and the infernal genius of Milady had more than once terrified him	398.427984897112
He felt something like a secret joy at being forever relieved of this dangerous accomplice	910.0635202328538
Richelieu slowly tore the paper which DArtagnan had generously relinquished	3083.218993172104
I am lost said DArtagnan to himself	57.416917136518364
And he bowed profoundly before the cardinal like a man who says Lord Thy will be done	199.20653884901637
The cardinal approached the table and without sitting down wrote a few lines upon a parchment of which twothirds were already filled and affixed his seal	395.07157048173883
That is my condemnation thought DArtagnan he will spare me the ennui of the Bastille or the tediousness of a trial	218.86901534028524
That s very kind of him	440.79152237805334
Here monsieur said the cardinal to the young man	8.669663498750968
I have taken from you one carte blanche to give you another	888.9694347090366
The name is wanting in this commission you can write it yourself	275.3615726701784
DArtagnan took the paper hesitatingly and cast his eyes over it it was a lieutenants commission in the Musketeers	225.9238129807123
DArtagnan fell at the feet of the cardinal	35.4731437460022
Monseigneur said he my life is yours henceforth dispose of it	533.0213675792577
But this favor which you bestow upon me I do not merit	120.4934018403189
I have three friends who are more meritorious and more worthy	658.5649507553582
You are a brave youth DArtagnan interrupted the cardinal tapping him familiarly on the shoulder charmed at having vanquished this rebellious nature	2026.7630620244845
Do with this commission what you will only remember though the name be blank it is to you I give it	185.4631532059359
I shall never forget it replied DArtagnan	789.1845855630742
Your Eminence may be certain of that	36.32201513814175
The cardinal turned and said in a loud voice Rochefort The chevalier who no doubt was near the door entered immediately	168.66919104507204
Rochefort said the cardinal you see Monsieur dArtagnan	650.6996480613889
I receive him among the number of my friends	56.23676019865064
Greet each other then and be wise if you wish to preserve your heads	206.89573650831636
Rochefort and DArtagnan coolly greeted each other with their lips but the cardinal was there observing them with his vigilant eye	216.42112749361544
They left the chamber at the same time	4.21311953158216
We shall meet again shall we not monsieur	257.5415529996021
An opportunity will come replied Rochefort	62118.163234335996
Hey said the cardinal opening the door	9.020729774660389
The two men smiled at each other shook hands and saluted his Eminence	356.86880028240313
We were beginning to grow impatient said Athos	4266.50279817739
Here I am my friends replied DArtagnan not only free but in favor	309.31523451761626
This evening but for the moment let us separate	144.82844535670142
Accordingly that same evening DArtagnan repaired to the quarters of Athos whom he found in a fair way to empty a bottle of Spanish winean occupation which he religiously accomplished every night	378.53091355842986
DArtagnan related what had taken place between the cardinal and himself and drawing the commission from his pocket said Here my dear Athos this naturally belongs to you	168.41770134193985
Athos smiled with one of his sweet and expressive smiles	357.3147678421483
Friend said he for Athos this is too much for the Comte de la Fre it is too little	61.53204471623968
Keep the commission it is yours	1637.7712057416015
Alas you have purchased it dearly enough	21133.018158678515
DArtagnan left Athoss chamber and went to that of Porthos	171.88013546933658
He found him clothed in a magnificent dress covered with splendid embroidery admiring himself before a glass	403.5677445097642
Ah ah is that you dear friend exclaimed Porthos	2723.4055180380683
How do you think these garments fit me	8165.718233365905
Wonderfully said DArtagnan but I come to offer you a dress which will become you still better	129.31021142357557
That of a lieutenant of Musketeers	78655.65272715848
DArtagnan related to Porthos the substance of his interview with the cardinal and said taking the commission from his pocket Here my friend write your name upon it and become my chief	254.7410237413266
Porthos cast his eyes over the commission and returned it to DArtagnan to the great astonishment of the young man	62.2026906951174
Yes said he yes that would flatter me very much but I should not have time enough to enjoy the distinction	110.56775735201364
During our expedition to Bthune the husband of my duchess died so my dear the coffer of the defunct holding out its arms to me I shall marry the widow	298.5721570498164
Look here I was trying on my wedding suit	395.3825625103906
Keep the lieutenancy my dear keep it	412.9428603824001
The young man then entered the apartment of Aramis	115.4106344342363
He found him kneeling before a priedieu with his head leaning on an open prayer book	383.49460830253634
He described to him his interview with the cardinal and said for the third time drawing his commission from his pocket You our friend our intelligence our invisible protector accept this commission	471.50218661180156
You have merited it more than any of us by your wisdom and your counsels always followed by such happy results	310.92865941629884
Alas dear friend said Aramis our late adventures have disgusted me with military life	1368.5268450998922
This time my determination is irrevocably taken	13307.756411672168
After the siege I shall enter the house of the Lazarists	84.20173934989674
Keep the commission DArtagnan the profession of arms suits you	1256.4272037449534
You will be a brave and adventurous captain	1853.9026857132521
DArtagnan his eye moist with gratitude though beaming with joy went back to Athos whom he found still at table contemplating the charms of his last glass of Malaga by the light of his lamp	290.5990609977246
Well said he they likewise have refused me	118.76013756720988
That dear friend is because nobody is more worthy than yourself	357.9680981156596
He took a quill wrote the name of DArtagnan in the commission and returned it to him	82.02234093596256
I shall then have no more friends said the young man	33.92549621261642
And he let his head sink upon his hands while two large tears rolled down his cheeks	52.74025414333019
You are young replied Athos and your bitter recollections have time to change themselves into sweet remembrances	1048.9542158846514
La Rochelle deprived of the assistance of the English fleet and of the diversion promised by Buckingham surrendered after a siege of a year	411.950734023504

DArtagnan fought three times with Rochefort and wounded him three times	561.5608431970824
I shall probably kill you the fourth said he to him holding out his hand to assist him to rise	60.228182985017625
It is much better both for you and for me to stop where we are answered the wounded man	110.7644565192776
Corbleu I am more your friend than you thinkfor after our very first encounter I could by saying a word to the cardinal have had your throat cut	700.9573905260961

The cardinal had him informed that he would provide for him so that he should never want for anything in future	104.47305291027594
Bonacieux having left his house at seven oclock in the evening to go to the Louvre never appeared again in the Rue des Fossoyeurs the opinion of those who seemed to be best informed was that he was fed and lodged in some royal castle at the expense of his generous Eminence	164.97211926181072
