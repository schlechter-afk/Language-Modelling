Athos and DArtagnan with the activity of two soldiers and the knowledge of two connoisseurs hardly required three hours to purchase the entire equipment of the Musketeer	119.84903717041016
Besides Athos was very easy and a noble to his fingers ends	163.0994110107422
When a thing suited him he paid the price demanded without thinking to ask for any abatement	445.6932067871094
DArtagnan would have remonstrated at this but Athos put his hand upon his shoulder with a smile and DArtagnan understood that it was all very well for such a little Gascon gentleman as himself to drive a bargain but not for a man who had the bearing of a prince	141.86378479003906
The Musketeer met with a superb Andalusian horse black as jet nostrils of fire legs clean and elegant rising six years	467.6019287109375
He examined him and found him sound and without blemish	396.80621337890625
They asked a thousand livres for him	262.6474609375
He might perhaps have been bought for less but while DArtagnan was discussing the price with the dealer Athos was counting out the money on the table	213.50155639648438
Grimaud had a stout short Picard cob which cost three hundred livres	290.48480224609375
But when the saddle and arms for Grimaud were purchased Athos had not a sou left of his hundred and fifty pistoles	276.33935546875
DArtagnan offered his friend a part of his share which he should return when convenient	114.72347259521484
But Athos only replied to this proposal by shrugging his shoulders	411.7969055175781
How much did the Jew say he would give for the sapphire if he purchased it said Athos	177.2628631591797
Five hundred pistoles	51.9201774597168
That is to say two hundred morea hundred pistoles for you and a hundred pistoles for me	83.07160949707031
Well now that would be a real fortune to us my friend let us go back to the Jews again	44.39640808105469
What will you	16.259939193725586
This ring would certainly only recall very bitter remembrances then we shall never be masters of three hundred pistoles to redeem it so that we really should lose two hundred pistoles by the bargain	820.9624633789062
Go and tell him the ring is his DArtagnan and bring back the two hundred pistoles with you	110.0118179321289
Reflect Athos	21.805540084838867
Ready money is needful for the present time and we must learn how to make sacrifices	174.0991668701172
Go DArtagnan go Grimaud will accompany you with his musketoon	105.44156646728516
A half hour afterward DArtagnan returned with the two thousand livres and without having met with any accident	53.64326095581055
It was thus Athos found at home resources which he did not expect	119.87561798095703
Chapter XXXIX	2.000459671020508
A VISION	20632.59765625
At four oclock the four friends were all assembled with Athos	45.826839447021484
Their anxiety about their outfits had all disappeared and each countenance only preserved the expression of its own secret disquietfor behind all present happiness is concealed a fear for the future	770.3638916015625
Suddenly Planchet entered bringing two letters for DArtagnan	177.95986938476562
The one was a little billet genteelly folded with a pretty seal in green wax on which was impressed a dove bearing a green branch	515.5582275390625
The other was a large square epistle resplendent with the terrible arms of his Eminence the cardinal duke	270.1869201660156
At the sight of the little letter the heart of DArtagnan bounded for he believed he recognized the handwriting and although he had seen that writing but once the memory of it remained at the bottom of his heart	73.72205352783203
He therefore seized the little epistle and opened it eagerly	337.4636535644531
Be said the letter on Thursday next at from six to seven oclock in the evening on the road to Chaillot and look carefully into the carriages that pass but if you have any consideration for your own life or that of those who love you do not speak a single word do not make a movement which may lead anyone to believe you have recognized her who exposes herself to everything for the sake of seeing you but for an instant	161.01724243164062
No signature	2060803.75
That s a snare said Athos do nt go DArtagnan	35.65660095214844
And yet replied DArtagnan I think I recognize the writing	63.30887222290039
It may be counterfeit said Athos	17.16594886779785
Between six and seven oclock the road of Chaillot is quite deserted you might as well go and ride in the forest of Bondy	194.4288330078125
But suppose we all go said DArtagnan what the devil They wo nt devour us all four four lackeys horses arms and all	155.9889373779297
And besides it will be a chance for displaying our new equipments said Porthos	235.30581665039062
But if it is a woman who writes said Aramis and that woman desires not to be seen remember you compromise her DArtagnan which is not the part of a gentleman	87.72399139404297
We will remain in the background said Porthos and he will advance alone	73.90624237060547
Yes but a pistol shot is easily fired from a carriage which goes at a gallop	401.5075378417969
Bah said DArtagnan they will miss me if they fire we will ride after the carriage and exterminate those who may be in it	83.3228530883789
They must be enemies	383.82684326171875
He is right said Porthos battle	155.01123046875
Besides we must try our own arms	190.3675537109375
Bah let us enjoy that pleasure said Aramis with his mild and careless manner	166.962890625
As you please said Athos	12.77023696899414
Gentlemen said DArtagnan it is half past four and we have scarcely time to be on the road of Chaillot by six	42.728294372558594
Besides if we go out too late nobody will see us said Porthos and that will be a pity	76.89905548095703
Let us get ready gentlemen	163.27813720703125
But this second letter said Athos you forget that it appears to me however that the seal denotes that it deserves to be opened	51.90201950073242
For my part I declare DArtagnan I think it of much more consequence than the little piece of waste paper you have so cunningly slipped into your bosom	164.569580078125
DArtagnan blushed	492.2210388183594
Well said he let us see gentlemen what are his Eminences commands and DArtagnan unsealed the letter and read	70.19512176513672
dArtagnan of the kings Guards company Dessessart is expected at the PalaisCardinal this evening at eight oclock	68.17288208007812
LA HOUDINIERE Captain of the Guards	84.17588806152344
The devil said Athos heres a rendezvous much more serious than the other	134.96815490722656
I will go to the second after attending the first said DArtagnan	206.34288024902344
One is for seven oclock and the other for eight there will be time for both	36.36670684814453
Hum I would not go at all said Aramis	402.9060974121094
A gallant knight can not decline a rendezvous with a lady but a prudent gentleman may excuse himself from not waiting on his Eminence particularly when he has reason to believe he is not invited to make his compliments	47.89164352416992
I am of Aramiss opinion said Porthos	29.065187454223633
Gentlemen replied DArtagnan I have already received by Monsieur de Cavois a similar invitation from his Eminence	399.5661315917969
I neglected it and on the morrow a serious misfortune happened to meConstance disappeared	135.89796447753906
Whatever may ensue I will go	41.43121337890625
If you are determined said Athos do so	21.01510238647461
But the Bastille said Aramis	64.76058197021484
Bah you will get me out if they put me there said DArtagnan	63.05487060546875
To be sure we will replied Aramis and Porthos with admirable promptness and decision as if that were the simplest thing in the world to be sure we will get you out but meantime as we are to set off the day after tomorrow you would do much better not to risk this Bastille	49.76001739501953
Let us do better than that said Athos do not let us leave him during the whole evening	291.5904541015625
Let each of us wait at a gate of the palace with three Musketeers behind him if we see a close carriage at all suspicious in appearance come out let us fall upon it	40.16715621948242
It is a long time since we have had a skirmish with the Guards of Monsieur the Cardinal Monsieur de Trville must think us dead	71.00556182861328
To a certainty Athos said Aramis you were meant to be a general of the army What do you think of the plan gentlemen	43.36117172241211
Admirable replied the young men in chorus	80.5512466430664
Well said Porthos I will run to the htel and engage our comrades to hold themselves in readiness by eight oclock the rendezvous the Place du PalaisCardinal	153.90176391601562
Meantime you see that the lackeys saddle the horses	42.902278900146484
I have no horse said DArtagnan but that is of no consequence I can take one of Monsieur de Trvilles	50.486907958984375
That is not worth while said Aramis you can have one of mine	105.0267333984375
One of yours how many have you then asked DArtagnan	99.68260955810547
Three replied Aramis smiling	43.238407135009766
Certes cried Athos you are the bestmounted poet of France or Navarre	63.26194763183594
Well my dear Aramis you do nt want three horses I can not comprehend what induced you to buy three	86.3490982055664
Therefore I only purchased two said Aramis	241.29693603515625
The third then fell from the clouds I suppose	215.8761444091797
No the third was brought to me this very morning by a groom out of livery who would not tell me in whose service he was and who said he had received orders from his master	548.622802734375
Or his mistress interrupted DArtagnan	229.60125732421875
That makes no difference said Aramis coloring and who affirmed as I said that he had received orders from his master or mistress to place the horse in my stable without informing me whence it came	297.4678955078125
It is only to poets that such things happen said Athos gravely	183.490966796875
Well in that case we can manage famously said DArtagnan which of the two horses will you ridethat which you bought or the one that was given to you	362.18536376953125
That which was given to me assuredly	92.51612091064453
You can not for a moment imagine DArtagnan that I would commit such an offense toward	1905.6063232421875
The unknown giver interrupted DArtagnan	80.72601318359375
Or the mysterious benefactress said Athos	556.7670288085938
The one you bought will then become useless to you	129.92930603027344
Nearly so	479.82427978515625
And you selected it yourself	181.0092010498047
With the greatest care	469.2232666015625
The safety of the horseman you know depends almost always upon the goodness of his horse	323.1797790527344
Well transfer it to me at the price it cost you	45.80196762084961
I was going to make you the offer my dear DArtagnan giving you all the time necessary for repaying me such a trifle	56.77915573120117
How much did it cost you	225.03887939453125
Eight hundred livres	174.61312866210938
Here are forty double pistoles my dear friend said DArtagnan taking the sum from his pocket I know that is the coin in which you were paid for your poems	23.046873092651367
You are rich then said Aramis	231.7529754638672
Rich Richest my dear fellow	191.92202758789062
And DArtagnan chinked the remainder of his pistoles in his pocket	50.97234344482422
Send your saddle then to the htel of the Musketeers and your horse can be brought back with ours	110.40715789794922
Very well but it is already five oclock so make haste	15.295746803283691
A quarter of an hour afterward Porthos appeared at the end of the Rue Frou on a very handsome genet	640.4857788085938
Mousqueton followed him upon an Auvergne horse small but very handsome	305.2951965332031
Porthos was resplendent with joy and pride	27.867063522338867
At the same time Aramis made his appearance at the other end of the street upon a superb English charger	798.7273559570312
Bazin followed him upon a roan holding by the halter a vigorous Mecklenburg horse this was DArtagnans mount	48.75233459472656
The two Musketeers met at the gate	86.78044128417969
Athos and DArtagnan watched their approach from the window	65.13463592529297
The devil cried Aramis you have a magnificent horse there Porthos	33.97746658325195
Yes replied Porthos it is the one that ought to have been sent to me at first	536.4923095703125
A bad joke of the husbands substituted the other but the husband has been punished since and I have obtained full satisfaction	189.3058319091797
Planchet and Grimaud appeared in their turn leading their masters steeds	96.6200180053711
DArtagnan and Athos put themselves into saddle with their companions and all four set forward Athos upon a horse he owed to a woman Aramis on a horse he owed to his mistress Porthos on a horse he owed to his procurators wife and DArtagnan on a horse he owed to his good fortunethe best mistress possible	1611.154052734375
The lackeys followed	86.09977722167969
As Porthos had foreseen the cavalcade produced a good effect and if Mme	153.96517944335938
Coquenard had met Porthos and seen what a superb appearance he made upon his handsome Spanish genet she would not have regretted the bleeding she had inflicted upon the strongbox of her husband	76.51780700683594
Near the Louvre the four friends met with M	30.959381103515625
de Trville who was returning from St	160.51620483398438
Germain he stopped them to offer his compliments upon their appointments which in an instant drew round them a hundred gapers	120.45589447021484
DArtagnan profited by the circumstance to speak to M	136.7888946533203
de Trville of the letter with the great red seal and the cardinals arms	41.10166931152344
It is well understood that he did not breathe a word about the other	167.9349365234375
de Trville approved of the resolution he had adopted and assured him that if on the morrow he did not appear he himself would undertake to find him let him be where he might	1.0454856157302856
At this moment the clock of La Samaritaine struck six the four friends pleaded an engagement and took leave of M	149.8509521484375
de Trville	471.88775634765625
A short gallop brought them to the road of Chaillot the day began to decline carriages were passing and repassing	133.0301055908203
DArtagnan keeping at some distance from his friends darted a scrutinizing glance into every carriage that appeared but saw no face with which he was acquainted	334.48101806640625
At length after waiting a quarter of an hour and just as twilight was beginning to thicken a carriage appeared coming at a quick pace on the road of Svres	305.0741271972656
A presentiment instantly told DArtagnan that this carriage contained the person who had appointed the rendezvous the young man was himself astonished to find his heart beat so violently	59.29572296142578
Almost instantly a female head was put out at the window with two fingers placed upon her mouth either to enjoin silence or to send him a kiss	285.1004638671875
DArtagnan uttered a slight cry of joy this woman or rather this apparitionfor the carriage passed with the rapidity of a visionwas Mme	312.2271728515625
By an involuntary movement and in spite of the injunction given DArtagnan put his horse into a gallop and in a few strides overtook the carriage but the window was hermetically closed the vision had disappeared	710.9259643554688
DArtagnan then remembered the injunction If you value your own life or that of those who love you remain motionless and as if you had seen nothing	225.35757446289062
He stopped therefore trembling not for himself but for the poor woman who had evidently exposed herself to great danger by appointing this rendezvous	14.875149726867676
The carriage pursued its way still going at a great pace till it dashed into Paris and disappeared	271.6134033203125
DArtagnan remained fixed to the spot astounded and not knowing what to think	357.9628601074219
If it was Mme	434.43572998046875
Bonacieux and if she was returning to Paris why this fugitive rendezvous why this simple exchange of a glance why this lost kiss If on the other side it was not shewhich was still quite possiblefor the little light that remained rendered a mistake easymight it not be the commencement of some plot against him through the allurement of this woman for whom his love was known	107.14441680908203
His three companions joined him	77.3732681274414
All had plainly seen a womans head appear at the window but none of them except Athos knew Mme	103.35353088378906
The opinion of Athos was that it was indeed she but less preoccupied by that pretty face than DArtagnan he had fancied he saw a second head a mans head inside the carriage	52.29674530029297
If that be the case said DArtagnan they are doubtless transporting her from one prison to another	68.9942398071289
But what can they intend to do with the poor creature and how shall I ever meet her again	175.30958557128906
Friend said Athos gravely remember that it is the dead alone with whom we are not likely to meet again on this earth	427.6643371582031
You know something of that as well as I do I think	107.7971420288086
Now if your mistress is not dead if it is she we have just seen you will meet with her again some day or other	83.37126159667969
And perhaps my God added he with that misanthropic tone which was peculiar to him perhaps sooner than you wish	64.93987274169922
Half past seven had sounded	30.820314407348633
The carriage had been twenty minutes behind the time appointed	334.83990478515625
DArtagnans friends reminded him that he had a visit to pay but at the same time bade him observe that there was yet time to retract	24.497684478759766
But DArtagnan was at the same time impetuous and curious	408.0307312011719
He had made up his mind that he would go to the PalaisCardinal and that he would learn what his Eminence had to say to him	276.0887451171875
Nothing could turn him from his purpose	249.04638671875
They reached the Rue St	841.5016479492188
Honor and in the Place du PalaisCardinal they found the twelve invited Musketeers walking about in expectation of their comrades	324.9345397949219
There only they explained to them the matter in hand	440.4526062011719
DArtagnan was well known among the honorable corps of the kings Musketeers in which it was known he would one day take his place he was considered beforehand as a comrade	44.898311614990234
It resulted from these antecedents that everyone entered heartily into the purpose for which they met besides it would not be unlikely that they would have an opportunity of playing either the cardinal or his people an ill turn and for such expeditions these worthy gentlemen were always ready	416.7311096191406
Athos divided them into three groups assumed the command of one gave the second to Aramis and the third to Porthos and then each group went and took their watch near an entrance	195.88389587402344
DArtagnan on his part entered boldly at the principal gate	107.06714630126953
Although he felt himself ably supported the young man was not without a little uneasiness as he ascended the great staircase step by step	351.8709716796875
His conduct toward Milady bore a strong resemblance to treachery and he was very suspicious of the political relations which existed between that woman and the cardinal	524.4147338867188
Still further De Wardes whom he had treated so ill was one of the tools of his Eminence and DArtagnan knew that while his Eminence was terrible to his enemies he was strongly attached to his friends	136.75245666503906
If De Wardes has related all our affair to the cardinal which is not to be doubted and if he has recognized me as is probable I may consider myself almost as a condemned man said DArtagnan shaking his head	221.11260986328125
But why has he waited till now That s all plain enough	236.021728515625
Milady has laid her complaints against me with that hypocritical grief which renders her so interesting and this last offense has made the cup overflow	236.3161163330078
Fortunately added he my good friends are down yonder and they will not allow me to be carried away without a struggle	101.28429412841797
Nevertheless Monsieur de Trvilles company of Musketeers alone can not maintain a war against the cardinal who disposes of the forces of all France and before whom the queen is without power and the king without will	184.2238006591797
DArtagnan my friend you are brave you are prudent you have excellent qualities but the women will ruin you	265.4862365722656
He came to this melancholy conclusion as he entered the antechamber	233.248779296875
He placed his letter in the hands of the usher on duty who led him into the waiting room and passed on into the interior of the palace	53.07976531982422
In this waiting room were five or six of the cardinals Guards who recognized DArtagnan and knowing that it was he who had wounded Jussac they looked upon him with a smile of singular meaning	80.9793472290039
This smile appeared to DArtagnan to be of bad augury	190.2679901123047
Only as our Gascon was not easily intimidatedor rather thanks to a great pride natural to the men of his country he did not allow one easily to see what was passing in his mind when that which was passing at all resembled fearhe placed himself haughtily in front of Messieurs the Guards and waited with his hand on his hip in an attitude by no means deficient in majesty	305.59521484375
The usher returned and made a sign to DArtagnan to follow him	88.1874771118164
It appeared to the young man that the Guards on seeing him depart chuckled among themselves	214.11907958984375
He traversed a corridor crossed a grand saloon entered a library and found himself in the presence of a man seated at a desk and writing	103.38167572021484
The usher introduced him and retired without speaking a word	124.99423217773438
DArtagnan remained standing and examined this man	69.44647216796875
DArtagnan at first believed that he had to do with some judge examining his papers but he perceived that the man at the desk wrote or rather corrected lines of unequal length scanning the words on his fingers	2.000459671020508
He saw then that he was with a poet	9409.7333984375
At the end of an instant the poet closed his manuscript upon the cover of which was written Mirame a Tragedy in Five Acts and raised his head	217.84115600585938
DArtagnan recognized the cardinal	78.54331970214844
Chapter XL	179.26722717285156
A TERRIBLE VISION	27.83744239807129
The cardinal leaned his elbow on his manuscript his cheek upon his hand and looked intently at the young man for a moment	22.487232208251953
No one had a more searching eye than the Cardinal de Richelieu and DArtagnan felt this glance run through his veins like a fever	250.80873107910156
He however kept a good countenance holding his hat in his hand and awaiting the good pleasure of his Eminence without too much assurance but also without too much humility	165.7771453857422
Monsieur said the cardinal are you a DArtagnan from Barn	26.563438415527344
Yes monseigneur replied the young man	73.55484771728516
There are several branches of the DArtagnans at Tarbes and in its environs said the cardinal to which do you belong	14848.8486328125
I am the son of him who served in the Religious Wars under the great King Henry the father of his gracious Majesty	670.5245971679688
That is well	213.7919921875
It is you who set out seven or eight months ago from your country to seek your fortune in the capital	36.309688568115234
Yes monseigneur	30.629474639892578
You came through Meung where something befell you	51.73402786254883
I do nt very well know what but still something	334.4491271972656
Monseigneur said DArtagnan this was what happened to me	167.08212280273438
Never mind never mind resumed the cardinal with a smile which indicated that he knew the story as well as he who wished to relate it	225.38336181640625
You were recommended to Monsieur de Trville were you not	325.11041259765625
Yes monseigneur but in that unfortunate affair at Meung	92.31067657470703
The letter was lost replied his Eminence yes I know that	99.48197937011719
But Monsieur de Trville is a skilled physiognomist who knows men at first sight and he placed you in the company of his brotherinlaw Monsieur Dessessart leaving you to hope that one day or other you should enter the Musketeers	100.95867919921875
Monseigneur is correctly informed said DArtagnan	64.99703979492188
Since that time many things have happened to you	210.70230102539062
You were walking one day behind the Chartreux when it would have been better if you had been elsewhere	625.5692749023438
Then you took with your friends a journey to the waters of Forges they stopped on the road but you continued yours	122.61754608154297
That is all very simple you had business in England	335.2485656738281
Monseigneur said DArtagnan quite confused I went	185.50088500976562
Hunting at Windsor or elsewherethat concerns nobody	105.92822265625
I know because it is my office to know everything	120.23622131347656
On your return you were received by an august personage and I perceive with pleasure that you preserve the souvenir she gave you	141.14244079589844
DArtagnan placed his hand upon the queens diamond which he wore and quickly turned the stone inward but it was too late	760.8568115234375
The day after that you received a visit from Cavois resumed the cardinal	454.2986755371094
He went to desire you to come to the palace	144.0828399658203
You have not returned that visit and you were wrong	82.75244140625
Monseigneur I feared I had incurred disgrace with your Eminence	108.66747283935547
How could that be monsieur Could you incur my displeasure by having followed the orders of your superiors with more intelligence and courage than another would have done It is the people who do not obey that I punish and not those who like you obeybut too well	302.4725036621094
As a proof remember the date of the day on which I had you bidden to come to me and seek in your memory for what happened to you that very night	58.31853103637695
That was the very evening when the abduction of Mme	85.31575775146484
Bonacieux took place	63.73887634277344
DArtagnan trembled and he likewise recollected that during the past half hour the poor woman had passed close to him without doubt carried away by the same power that had caused her disappearance	181.39637756347656
In short continued the cardinal as I have heard nothing of you for some time past I wished to know what you were doing	170.70166015625
Besides you owe me some thanks	172.00054931640625
You must yourself have remarked how much you have been considered in all the circumstances	107.12230682373047
DArtagnan bowed with respect	106.67063903808594
That continued the cardinal arose not only from a feeling of natural equity but likewise from a plan I have marked out with respect to you	192.60621643066406
DArtagnan became more and more astonished	44.17531204223633
I wished to explain this plan to you on the day you received my first invitation but you did not come	132.69989013671875
Fortunately nothing is lost by this delay and you are now about to hear it	889.4668579101562
Sit down there before me DArtagnan you are gentleman enough not to listen standing	56.447303771972656
And the cardinal pointed with his finger to a chair for the young man who was so astonished at what was passing that he awaited a second sign from his interlocutor before he obeyed	612.3477172851562
You are brave Monsieur dArtagnan continued his Eminence you are prudent which is still better	281.1369934082031
I like men of head and heart	88.97777557373047
Do nt be afraid said he smiling	88.93022155761719
By men of heart I mean men of courage	118.28777313232422
But young as you are and scarcely entering into the world you have powerful enemies if you do not take great heed they will destroy you	168.75912475585938
Alas monseigneur replied the young man very easily no doubt for they are strong and well supported while I am alone	288.9564514160156
Yes that s true but alone as you are you have done much already and will do still more I do nt doubt	157.8975372314453
Yet you have need I believe to be guided in the adventurous career you have undertaken for if I mistake not you came to Paris with the ambitious idea of making your fortune	19750.572265625
I am at the age of extravagant hopes monseigneur said DArtagnan	63.95558166503906
There are no extravagant hopes but for fools monsieur and you are a man of understanding	31.88286018371582
Now what would you say to an ensigns commission in my Guards and a company after the campaign	52.060211181640625
Ah monseigneur	154.52157592773438
You accept it do you not	144.47201538085938
Monseigneur replied DArtagnan with an embarrassed air	302.8865966796875
How You refuse cried the cardinal with astonishment	302.8367614746094
I am in his Majestys Guards monseigneur and I have no reason to be dissatisfied	548.0606689453125
But it appears to me that my Guardsmineare also his Majestys Guards and whoever serves in a French corps serves the king	257.8909912109375
Monseigneur your Eminence has ill understood my words	449.15753173828125
You want a pretext do you not I comprehend	2167.105224609375
Well you have this excuse advancement the opening campaign the opportunity which I offer youso much for the world	59.340782165527344
As regards yourself the need of protection for it is fit you should know Monsieur dArtagnan that I have received heavy and serious complaints against you	262.0221252441406
You do not consecrate your days and nights wholly to the kings service	3098.44970703125
DArtagnan colored	109.99010467529297
In fact said the cardinal placing his hand upon a bundle of papers I have here a whole pile which concerns you	3866.216796875
I know you to be a man of resolution and your services well directed instead of leading you to ill might be very advantageous to you	2675.647705078125
Come reflect and decide	49.076446533203125
Your goodness confounds me monseigneur replied DArtagnan and I am conscious of a greatness of soul in your Eminence that makes me mean as an earthworm but since Monseigneur permits me to speak freely	97.14102172851562
DArtagnan paused	60.16450881958008
Yes speak	212.82217407226562
Then I will presume to say that all my friends are in the kings Musketeers and Guards and that by an inconceivable fatality my enemies are in the service of your Eminence I should therefore be ill received here and ill regarded there if I accepted what Monseigneur offers me	59.33263397216797
Do you happen to entertain the haughty idea that I have not yet made you an offer equal to your value asked the cardinal with a smile of disdain	1611.0157470703125
Monseigneur your Eminence is a hundred times too kind to me and on the contrary I think I have not proved myself worthy of your goodness	94.26065826416016
The siege of La Rochelle is about to be resumed monseigneur	38.412837982177734
I shall serve under the eye of your Eminence and if I have the good fortune to conduct myself at the siege in such a manner as merits your attention then I shall at least leave behind me some brilliant action to justify the protection with which you honor me	48.113914489746094
Everything is best in its time monseigneur	118.7083969116211
Hereafter perhaps I shall have the right of giving myself at present I shall appear to sell myself	58.986812591552734
That is to say you refuse to serve me monsieur said the cardinal with a tone of vexation through which however might be seen a sort of esteem remain free then and guard your hatreds and your sympathies	203.62399291992188
Well well said the cardinal I do nt wish you any ill but you must be aware that it is quite trouble enough to defend and recompense our friends	43.82666778564453
We owe nothing to our enemies and let me give you a piece of advice take care of yourself Monsieur dArtagnan for from the moment I withdraw my hand from behind you I would not give an obolus for your life	71.2015380859375
I will try to do so monseigneur replied the Gascon with a noble confidence	279.7976379394531
Remember at a later period and at a certain moment if any mischance should happen to you said Richelieu significantly that it was I who came to seek you and that I did all in my power to prevent this misfortune befalling you	830.046142578125
I shall entertain whatever may happen said DArtagnan placing his hand upon his breast and bowing an eternal gratitude toward your Eminence for that which you now do for me	26.3614444732666
Well let it be then as you have said Monsieur dArtagnan we shall see each other again after the campaign	646.6030883789062
I will have my eye upon you for I shall be there replied the cardinal pointing with his finger to a magnificent suit of armor he was to wear and on our return wellwe will settle our account	123.28802490234375
Ah monseigneur cried DArtagnan spare me the weight of your displeasure	105.00173950195312
Remain neutral monseigneur if you find that I act as becomes a gallant man	69.2308349609375
Young man said Richelieu if I shall be able to say to you at another time what I have said to you today I promise you to do so	178.990478515625
This last expression of Richelieus conveyed a terrible doubt it alarmed DArtagnan more than a menace would have done for it was a warning	217.79225158691406
The cardinal then was seeking to preserve him from some misfortune which threatened him	53.508358001708984
He opened his mouth to reply but with a haughty gesture the cardinal dismissed him	123.26045989990234
DArtagnan went out but at the door his heart almost failed him and he felt inclined to return	47.26902389526367
Then the noble and severe countenance of Athos crossed his mind if he made the compact with the cardinal which he required Athos would no more give him his handAthos would renounce him	46.79497528076172
It was this fear that restrained him so powerful is the influence of a truly great character on all that surrounds it	42.49369812011719
DArtagnan descended by the staircase at which he had entered and found Athos and the four Musketeers waiting his appearance and beginning to grow uneasy	243.1798095703125
With a word DArtagnan reassured them and Planchet ran to inform the other sentinels that it was useless to keep guard longer as his master had come out safe from the PalaisCardinal	54.033809661865234
Returned home with Athos Aramis and Porthos inquired eagerly the cause of the strange interview but DArtagnan confined himself to telling them that M	150.44024658203125
de Richelieu had sent for him to propose to him to enter into his guards with the rank of ensign and that he had refused	163.75025939941406
And you were right cried Aramis and Porthos with one voice	129.26783752441406
Athos fell into a profound reverie and answered nothing	1.0454856157302856
But when they were alone he said You have done that which you ought to have done DArtagnan but perhaps you have been wrong	64.8322982788086
DArtagnan sighed deeply for this voice responded to a secret voice of his soul which told him that great misfortunes awaited him	134.10992431640625
The whole of the next day was spent in preparations for departure	346.2737121582031
DArtagnan went to take leave of M	117.70262908935547
de Trville	134.48953247070312
At that time it was believed that the separation of the Musketeers and the Guards would be but momentary the king holding his Parliament that very day and proposing to set out the day after	613.676513671875
de Trville contented himself with asking DArtagnan if he could do anything for him but DArtagnan answered that he was supplied with all he wanted	826.2366333007812
That night brought together all those comrades of the Guards of M	147.5491943359375
Dessessart and the company of Musketeers of M	75.99173736572266
de Trville who had been accustomed to associate together	75.84168243408203
They were parting to meet again when it pleased God and if it pleased God	345.4754638671875
That night then was somewhat riotous as may be imagined	64.3488540649414
In such cases extreme preoccupation is only to be combated by extreme carelessness	167.4874267578125
At the first sound of the morning trumpet the friends separated the Musketeers hastening to the htel of M	349.0113525390625
de Trville the Guards to that of M	197.5169219970703
Each of the captains then led his company to the Louvre where the king held his review	1213.525390625
The king was dull and appeared ill which detracted a little from his usual lofty bearing	683.8314208984375
In fact the evening before a fever had seized him in the midst of the Parliament while he was holding his Bed of Justice	180.18087768554688
He had not the less decided upon setting out that same evening and in spite of the remonstrances that had been offered to him he persisted in having the review hoping by setting it at defiance to conquer the disease which began to lay hold upon him	132.126708984375
The review over the Guards set forward alone on their march the Musketeers waiting for the king which allowed Porthos time to go and take a turn in his superb equipment in the Rue aux Ours	984.7312622070312
The procurators wife saw him pass in his new uniform and on his fine horse	227.23448181152344
She loved Porthos too dearly to allow him to part thus she made him a sign to dismount and come to her	217.49273681640625
Porthos was magnificent his spurs jingled his cuirass glittered his sword knocked proudly against his ample limbs	534.7135620117188
This time the clerks evinced no inclination to laugh such a real ear clipper did Porthos appear	197.86741638183594
The Musketeer was introduced to M	8.998068809509277
Coquenard whose little gray eyes sparkled with anger at seeing his cousin all blazing new	214.32257080078125
Nevertheless one thing afforded him inward consolation it was expected by everybody that the campaign would be a severe one	239.07472229003906
He whispered a hope to himself that this beloved relative might be killed in the field	18986.498046875
Porthos paid his compliments to M	90.05332946777344
Coquenard and bade him farewell	244.78541564941406
Coquenard wished him all sorts of prosperities	5730.4658203125
As to Mme	70.15691375732422
Coquenard she could not restrain her tears but no evil impressions were taken from her grief as she was known to be very much attached to her relatives about whom she was constantly having serious disputes with her husband	460.9129638671875
But the real adieux were made in Mme	26.007295608520508
Coquenards chamber they were heartrending	58.78242874145508
As long as the procurators wife could follow him with her eyes she waved her handkerchief to him leaning so far out of the window as to lead people to believe she wished to precipitate herself	51.73292922973633
Porthos received all these attentions like a man accustomed to such demonstrations only on turning the corner of the street he lifted his hat gracefully and waved it to her as a sign of adieu	130.96316528320312
On his part Aramis wrote a long letter	149.8655242919922
To whom Nobody knew	85.99555969238281
Kitty who was to set out that evening for Tours was waiting in the next chamber	4629.2373046875
Athos sipped the last bottle of his Spanish wine	2.000459671020508
In the meantime DArtagnan was defiling with his company	70.95757293701172
Arriving at the Faubourg St	85.49662017822266
Antoine he turned round to look gaily at the Bastille but as it was the Bastille alone he looked at he did not observe Milady who mounted upon a light chestnut horse designated him with her finger to two illlooking men who came close up to the ranks to take notice of him	258.38494873046875
To a look of interrogation which they made Milady replied by a sign that it was he	131.11424255371094
Then certain that there could be no mistake in the execution of her orders she started her horse and disappeared	1578.5306396484375
The two men followed the company and on leaving the Faubourg St	278.1470642089844
Antoine mounted two horses properly equipped which a servant without livery had waiting for them	310.1420593261719
Chapter XLI	424.17559814453125
THE SIEGE OF LA ROCHELLE	131.55914306640625
The Siege of La Rochelle was one of the great political events of the reign of Louis XIII	1598.6700439453125
and one of the great military enterprises of the cardinal	109.13311004638672
It is then interesting and even necessary that we should say a few words about it particularly as many details of this siege are connected in too important a manner with the story we have undertaken to relate to allow us to pass it over in silence	67.65496826171875
The political plans of the cardinal when he undertook this siege were extensive	35.56068420410156
Let us unfold them first and then pass on to the private plans which perhaps had not less influence upon his Eminence than the others	38.99053192138672
Of the important cities given up by Henry IV	17.38953971862793
to the Huguenots as places of safety there only remained La Rochelle	144.95069885253906
It became necessary therefore to destroy this last bulwark of Calvinisma dangerous leaven with which the ferments of civil revolt and foreign war were constantly mingling	668.4869384765625
Spaniards Englishmen and Italian malcontents adventurers of all nations and soldiers of fortune of every sect flocked at the first summons under the standard of the Protestants and organized themselves like a vast association whose branches diverged freely over all parts of Europe	314.7388916015625
La Rochelle which had derived a new importance from the ruin of the other Calvinist cities was then the focus of dissensions and ambition	42.63971710205078
Moreover its port was the last in the kingdom of France open to the English and by closing it against England our eternal enemy the cardinal completed the work of Joan of Arc and the Duc de Guise	175.6241912841797
Thus Bassompierre who was at once Protestant and CatholicProtestant by conviction and Catholic as commander of the order of the Holy Ghost Bassompierre who was a German by birth and a Frenchman at heartin short Bassompierre who had a distinguished command at the siege of La Rochelle said in charging at the head of several other Protestant nobles like himself You will see gentlemen that we shall be fools enough to take La Rochelle	160.46676635742188
And Bassompierre was right	969.566162109375
The cannonade of the Isle of R presaged to him the dragonnades of the Cvennes the taking of La Rochelle was the preface to the revocation of the Edict of Nantes	324.84576416015625
We have hinted that by the side of these views of the leveling and simplifying minister which belong to history the chronicler is forced to recognize the lesser motives of the amorous man and jealous rival	618.4515991210938
Richelieu as everyone knows had loved the queen	113.88085174560547
Was this love a simple political affair or was it naturally one of those profound passions which Anne of Austria inspired in those who approached her That we are not able to say but at all events we have seen by the anterior developments of this story that Buckingham had the advantage over him and in two or three circumstances particularly that of the diamond studs had thanks to the devotedness of the three Musketeers and the courage and conduct of DArtagnan cruelly mystified him	205.07431030273438
It was then Richelieus object not only to get rid of an enemy of France but to avenge himself on a rival but this vengeance must be grand and striking and worthy in every way of a man who held in his hand as his weapon for combat the forces of a kingdom	285.5735168457031
Richelieu knew that in combating England he combated Buckingham that in triumphing over England he triumphed over Buckinghamin short that in humiliating England in the eyes of Europe he humiliated Buckingham in the eyes of the queen	1.0454856157302856
On his side Buckingham in pretending to maintain the honor of England was moved by interests exactly like those of the cardinal	239.75833129882812
Buckingham also was pursuing a private vengeance	110.81049346923828
Buckingham could not under any pretense be admitted into France as an ambassador he wished to enter it as a conqueror	117.10004425048828
It resulted from this that the real stake in this game which two most powerful kingdoms played for the good pleasure of two amorous men was simply a kind look from Anne of Austria	226.50059509277344
The first advantage had been gained by Buckingham	92.88737487792969
Arriving unexpectedly in sight of the Isle of R with ninety vessels and nearly twenty thousand men he had surprised the Comte de Toiras who commanded for the king in the Isle and he had after a bloody conflict effected his landing	516.8958740234375
Allow us to observe in passing that in this fight perished the Baron de Chantal that the Baron de Chantal left a little orphan girl eighteen months old and that this little girl was afterward Mme	1179.4151611328125
de Svign	194.31068420410156
The Comte de Toiras retired into the citadel St	178.91964721679688
Martin with his garrison and threw a hundred men into a little fort called the fort of La Pre	335.6369323730469
This event had hastened the resolutions of the cardinal and till the king and he could take the command of the siege of La Rochelle which was determined he had sent Monsieur to direct the first operations and had ordered all the troops he could dispose of to march toward the theater of war	24.57379722595215
It was of this detachment sent as a vanguard that our friend DArtagnan formed a part	46.804473876953125
The king as we have said was to follow as soon as his Bed of Justice had been held but on rising from his Bed of Justice on the twentyeighth of June he felt himself attacked by fever	563.9559326171875
He was notwithstanding anxious to set out but his illness becoming more serious he was forced to stop at Villeroy	236.20819091796875
Now whenever the king halted the Musketeers halted	65.48735809326172
It followed that DArtagnan who was as yet purely and simply in the Guards found himself for the time at least separated from his good friendsAthos Porthos and Aramis	552.271728515625
This separation which was no more than an unpleasant circumstance would have certainly become a cause of serious uneasiness if he had been able to guess by what unknown dangers he was surrounded	114.00048828125
He however arrived without accident in the camp established before La Rochelle on the tenth of the month of September of the year 1627	167.36488342285156
Everything was in the same state	9.744902610778809
The Duke of Buckingham and his English masters of the Isle of R continued to besiege but without success the citadel St	106.67404174804688
Martin and the fort of La Pre and hostilities with La Rochelle had commenced two or three days before about a fort which the Duc dAngoulme had caused to be constructed near the city	225.78350830078125
The Guards under the command of M	69.28836059570312
Dessessart took up their quarters at the Minimes but as we know DArtagnan possessed with ambition to enter the Musketeers had formed but few friendships among his comrades and he felt himself isolated and given up to his own reflections	123.00123596191406
His reflections were not very cheerful	190.41676330566406
From the time of his arrival in Paris he had been mixed up with public affairs but his own private affairs had made no great progress either in love or fortune	118.3700942993164
As to love the only woman he could have loved was Mme	137.23028564453125
Bonacieux and Mme	188.2527313232422
Bonacieux had disappeared without his being able to discover what had become of her	553.8395385742188
As to fortune he had madehe humble as he wasan enemy of the cardinal that is to say of a man before whom trembled the greatest men of the kingdom beginning with the king	418.711181640625
That man had the power to crush him and yet he had not done so	301.9581604003906
For a mind so perspicuous as that of DArtagnan this indulgence was a light by which he caught a glimpse of a better future	139.05821228027344
Then he had made himself another enemy less to be feared he thought but nevertheless he instinctively felt not to be despised	128.14503479003906
This enemy was Milady	109.11083984375
In exchange for all this he had acquired the protection and good will of the queen but the favor of the queen was at the present time an additional cause of persecution and her protection as it was known protected badlyas witness Chalais and Mme	72.19038391113281
What he had clearly gained in all this was the diamond worth five or six thousand livres which he wore on his finger and even this diamondsupposing that DArtagnan in his projects of ambition wished to keep it to make it someday a pledge for the gratitude of the queenhad not in the meanwhile since he could not part with it more value than the gravel he trod under his feet	111.38542938232422
We say the gravel he trod under his feet for DArtagnan made these reflections while walking solitarily along a pretty little road which led from the camp to the village of Angoutin	56.53722381591797
Now these reflections had led him further than he intended and the day was beginning to decline when by the last ray of the setting sun he thought he saw the barrel of a musket glitter from behind a hedge	266.756591796875
DArtagnan had a quick eye and a prompt understanding	283.98486328125
He comprehended that the musket had not come there of itself and that he who bore it had not concealed himself behind a hedge with any friendly intentions	49.50222396850586
He determined therefore to direct his course as clear from it as he could when on the opposite side of the road from behind a rock he perceived the extremity of another musket	69.82001495361328
This was evidently an ambuscade	123.7868423461914
The young man cast a glance at the first musket and saw with a certain degree of inquietude that it was leveled in his direction but as soon as he perceived that the orifice of the barrel was motionless he threw himself upon the ground	135.0316925048828
At the same instant the gun was fired and he heard the whistling of a ball pass over his head	646.8812866210938
No time was to be lost	35.18507385253906
DArtagnan sprang up with a bound and at the same instant the ball from the other musket tore up the gravel on the very spot on the road where he had thrown himself with his face to the ground	76.21614837646484
DArtagnan was not one of those foolhardy men who seek a ridiculous death in order that it may be said of them that they did not retreat a single step	183.38180541992188
Besides courage was out of the question here DArtagnan had fallen into an ambush	261.7062072753906
If there is a third shot said he to himself I am a lost man	190.3195343017578
He immediately therefore took to his heels and ran toward the camp with the swiftness of the young men of his country so renowned for their agility but whatever might be his speed the first who fired having had time to reload fired a second shot and this time so well aimed that it struck his hat and carried it ten paces from him	76.90506744384766
As he however had no other hat he picked up this as he ran and arrived at his quarters very pale and quite out of breath	80.47220611572266
He sat down without saying a word to anybody and began to reflect	76.52040100097656
This event might have three causes	324.99200439453125
The first and the most natural was that it might be an ambuscade of the Rochellais who might not be sorry to kill one of his Majestys Guards because it would be an enemy the less and this enemy might have a wellfurnished purse in his pocket	118.15084838867188
DArtagnan took his hat examined the hole made by the ball and shook his head	230.025146484375
The ball was not a musket ballit was an arquebus ball	100.93292999267578
The accuracy of the aim had first given him the idea that a special weapon had been employed	217.4610137939453
This could not then be a military ambuscade as the ball was not of the regular caliber	161.90139770507812
This might be a kind remembrance of Monsieur the Cardinal	3394.243408203125
It may be observed that at the very moment when thanks to the ray of the sun he perceived the gun barrel he was thinking with astonishment on the forbearance of his Eminence with respect to him	1815.51953125
But DArtagnan again shook his head	898.5036010742188
For people toward whom he had but to put forth his hand his Eminence had rarely recourse to such means	178.3065948486328
It might be a vengeance of Milady that was most probable	293.8827209472656
He tried in vain to remember the faces or dress of the assassins he had escaped so rapidly that he had not had leisure to notice anything	29.291404724121094
Ah my poor friends murmured DArtagnan where are you And that you should fail me	152.683349609375
DArtagnan passed a very bad night	82.23920440673828
Three or four times he started up imagining that a man was approaching his bed for the purpose of stabbing him	71.53374481201172
Nevertheless day dawned without darkness having brought any accident	49.17961502075195
But DArtagnan well suspected that that which was deferred was not relinquished	80.3507308959961
DArtagnan remained all day in his quarters assigning as a reason to himself that the weather was bad	220.86056518554688
At nine oclock the next morning the drums beat to arms	90.35118103027344
The Duc dOrlans visited the posts	45.4132080078125
The guards were under arms and DArtagnan took his place in the midst of his comrades	354.8071594238281
Monsieur passed along the front of the line then all the superior officers approached him to pay their compliments M	86.04704284667969
Dessessart captain of the Guards as well as the others	171.64340209960938
At the expiration of a minute or two it appeared to DArtagnan that M	283.7149963378906
Dessessart made him a sign to approach	309.46240234375
He waited for a fresh gesture on the part of his superior for fear he might be mistaken but this gesture being repeated he left the ranks and advanced to receive orders	217.73699951171875
Monsieur is about to ask for some men of good will for a dangerous mission but one which will do honor to those who shall accomplish it and I made you a sign in order that you might hold yourself in readiness	270.6934509277344
Thanks my captain replied DArtagnan who wished for nothing better than an opportunity to distinguish himself under the eye of the lieutenant general	104.1343994140625
In fact the Rochellais had made a sortie during the night and had retaken a bastion of which the royal army had gained possession two days before	98.43688201904297
The matter was to ascertain by reconnoitering how the enemy guarded this bastion	82.7452621459961
At the end of a few minutes Monsieur raised his voice and said I want for this mission three or four volunteers led by a man who can be depended upon	131.09524536132812
As to the man to be depended upon I have him under my hand monsieur said M	151.37750244140625
Dessessart pointing to DArtagnan and as to the four or five volunteers Monsieur has but to make his intentions known and the men will not be wanting	540.3184204101562
Four men of good will who will risk being killed with me said DArtagnan raising his sword	579.3721923828125
Two of his comrades of the Guards immediately sprang forward and two other soldiers having joined them the number was deemed sufficient	805.1922607421875
DArtagnan declined all others being unwilling to take the first chance from those who had the priority	268.4981384277344
It was not known whether after the taking of the bastion the Rochellais had evacuated it or left a garrison in it the object then was to examine the place near enough to verify the reports	963.1758422851562
DArtagnan set out with his four companions and followed the trench the two Guards marched abreast with him and the two soldiers followed behind	158.67359924316406
They arrived thus screened by the lining of the trench till they came within a hundred paces of the bastion	66.8423843383789
There on turning round DArtagnan perceived that the two soldiers had disappeared	61.68376541137695
He thought that beginning to be afraid they had stayed behind and he continued to advance	150.730712890625
At the turning of the counterscarp they found themselves within about sixty paces of the bastion	343.1318359375
They saw no one and the bastion seemed abandoned	115.05271911621094
The three composing our forlorn hope were deliberating whether they should proceed any further when all at once a circle of smoke enveloped the giant of stone and a dozen balls came whistling around DArtagnan and his companions	71.11620330810547
They knew all they wished to know the bastion was guarded	100.38053131103516
A longer stay in this dangerous spot would have been useless imprudence	109.7755355834961
DArtagnan and his two companions turned their backs and commenced a retreat which resembled a flight	1463.5643310546875
On arriving at the angle of the trench which was to serve them as a rampart one of the Guardsmen fell	76.91155242919922
A ball had passed through his breast	187.73316955566406
The other who was safe and sound continued his way toward the camp	939.2649536132812
DArtagnan was not willing to abandon his companion thus and stooped to raise him and assist him in regaining the lines but at this moment two shots were fired	164.45497131347656
One ball struck the head of the alreadywounded guard and the other flattened itself against a rock after having passed within two inches of DArtagnan	1734.663330078125
The young man turned quickly round for this attack could not have come from the bastion which was hidden by the angle of the trench	172.35752868652344
The idea of the two soldiers who had abandoned him occurred to his mind and with them he remembered the assassins of two evenings before	430.1328125
He resolved this time to know with whom he had to deal and fell upon the body of his comrade as if he were dead	159.6326141357422
He quickly saw two heads appear above an abandoned work within thirty paces of him they were the heads of the two soldiers	312.10675048828125
DArtagnan had not been deceived these two men had only followed for the purpose of assassinating him hoping that the young mans death would be placed to the account of the enemy	235.34251403808594
As he might be only wounded and might denounce their crime they came up to him with the purpose of making sure	154.88873291015625
Fortunately deceived by DArtagnans trick they neglected to reload their guns	149.4654541015625
When they were within ten paces of him DArtagnan who in falling had taken care not to let go his sword sprang up close to them	49.54838943481445
The assassins comprehended that if they fled toward the camp without having killed their man they should be accused by him therefore their first idea was to join the enemy	44.06914520263672
One of them took his gun by the barrel and used it as he would a club	99.30259704589844
He aimed a terrible blow at DArtagnan who avoided it by springing to one side but by this movement he left a passage free to the bandit who darted off toward the bastion	181.2815399169922
As the Rochellais who guarded the bastion were ignorant of the intentions of the man they saw coming toward them they fired upon him and he fell struck by a ball which broke his shoulder	293.5799255371094
Meantime DArtagnan had thrown himself upon the other soldier attacking him with his sword	69.92882537841797
The conflict was not long the wretch had nothing to defend himself with but his discharged arquebus	40.273136138916016
The sword of the Guardsman slipped along the barrel of the nowuseless weapon and passed through the thigh of the assassin who fell	1223.1710205078125
DArtagnan immediately placed the point of his sword at his throat	143.60586547851562
Oh do not kill me cried the bandit	151.5892333984375
Pardon pardon my officer and I will tell you all	101.6014175415039
Is your secret of enough importance to me to spare your life for it asked the young man withholding his arm	219.47665405273438
Yes if you think existence worth anything to a man of twenty as you are and who may hope for everything being handsome and brave as you are	118.75975036621094
Wretch cried DArtagnan speak quickly Who employed you to assassinate me	158.72665405273438
A woman whom I do nt know but who is called Milady	754.8436279296875
But if you do nt know this woman how do you know her name	168.9278564453125
My comrade knows her and called her so	176.1338348388672
It was with him she agreed and not with me he even has in his pocket a letter from that person who attaches great importance to you as I have heard him say	85.47374725341797
But how did you become concerned in this villainous affair	245.01580810546875
He proposed to me to undertake it with him and I agreed	106.44285583496094
And how much did she give you for this fine enterprise	146.435302734375
A hundred louis	151.8155059814453
Well come said the young man laughing she thinks I am worth something	36.051116943359375
A hundred louis Well that was a temptation for two wretches like you	407.57476806640625
I understand why you accepted it and I grant you my pardon but upon one condition	40.88177490234375
What is that said the soldier uneasy at perceiving that all was not over	204.59620666503906
That you will go and fetch me the letter your comrade has in his pocket	657.1724243164062
But cried the bandit that is only another way of killing me	97.63456726074219
How can I go and fetch that letter under the fire of the bastion	212.35060119628906
You must nevertheless make up your mind to go and get it or I swear you shall die by my hand	116.32347869873047
Pardon monsieur pity In the name of that young lady you love and whom you perhaps believe dead but who is not cried the bandit throwing himself upon his knees and leaning upon his handfor he began to lose his strength with his blood	144.5336151123047
And how do you know there is a young woman whom I love and that I believed that woman dead asked DArtagnan	82.4393310546875
By that letter which my comrade has in his pocket	237.34649658203125
You see then said DArtagnan that I must have that letter	222.26832580566406
So no more delay no more hesitation or else whatever may be my repugnance to soiling my sword a second time with the blood of a wretch like you I swear by my faith as an honest man and at these words DArtagnan made so fierce a gesture that the wounded man sprang up	1062.694091796875
Stop stop cried he regaining strength by force of terror	458.97308349609375
I will goI will go	88.19269561767578
DArtagnan took the soldiers arquebus made him go on before him and urged him toward his companion by pricking him behind with his sword	47.75504684448242
It was a frightful thing to see this wretch leaving a long track of blood on the ground he passed over pale with approaching death trying to drag himself along without being seen to the body of his accomplice which lay twenty paces from him	169.65826416015625
Terror was so strongly painted on his face covered with a cold sweat that DArtagnan took pity on him and casting upon him a look of contempt Stop said he I will show you the difference between a man of courage and such a coward as you	161.64035034179688
Stay where you are I will go myself	209.5100860595703
And with a light step an eye on the watch observing the movements of the enemy and taking advantage of the accidents of the ground DArtagnan succeeded in reaching the second soldier	56.20552444458008
There were two means of gaining his objectto search him on the spot or to carry him away making a buckler of his body and search him in the trench	246.9285430908203
DArtagnan preferred the second means and lifted the assassin onto his shoulders at the moment the enemy fired	2060803.75
A slight shock the dull noise of three balls which penetrated the flesh a last cry a convulsion of agony proved to DArtagnan that the wouldbe assassin had saved his life	61.5490837097168
DArtagnan regained the trench and threw the corpse beside the wounded man who was as pale as death	335.0190734863281
Then he began to search	315.8548889160156
A leather pocketbook a purse in which was evidently a part of the sum which the bandit had received with a dice box and dice completed the possessions of the dead man	64.12129974365234
He left the box and dice where they fell threw the purse to the wounded man and eagerly opened the pocketbook	73.79299926757812
Among some unimportant papers he found the following letter that which he had sought at the risk of his life	89.70433044433594
Since you have lost sight of that woman and she is now in safety in the convent which you should never have allowed her to reach try at least not to miss the man	1292.2618408203125
If you do you know that my hand stretches far and that you shall pay very dearly for the hundred louis you have from me	98.89969635009766
No signature	162.14723205566406
Nevertheless it was plain the letter came from Milady	244.55953979492188
He consequently kept it as a piece of evidence and being in safety behind the angle of the trench he began to interrogate the wounded man	182.51771545410156
He confessed that he had undertaken with his comradethe same who was killedto carry off a young woman who was to leave Paris by the Barrire de La Villette but having stopped to drink at a cabaret they had missed the carriage by ten minutes	834.708984375
But what were you to do with that woman asked DArtagnan with anguish	1163.6424560546875
We were to have conveyed her to a htel in the Place Royale said the wounded man	137.6189422607422
Yes yes murmured DArtagnan that s the placeMiladys own residence	36.468666076660156
Then the young man tremblingly comprehended what a terrible thirst for vengeance urged this woman on to destroy him as well as all who loved him and how well she must be acquainted with the affairs of the court since she had discovered all	44.68244552612305
There could be no doubt she owed this information to the cardinal	51.10799026489258
But amid all this he perceived with a feeling of real joy that the queen must have discovered the prison in which poor Mme	316.83599853515625
Bonacieux was explaining her devotion and that she had freed her from that prison and the letter he had received from the young woman and her passage along the road of Chaillot like an apparition were now explained	121.51704406738281
Then also as Athos had predicted it became possible to find Mme	106.89161682128906
Bonacieux and a convent was not impregnable	325.43365478515625
This idea completely restored clemency to his heart	494.7515869140625
He turned toward the wounded man who had watched with intense anxiety all the various expressions of his countenance and holding out his arm to him said Come I will not abandon you thus	809.8746337890625
Lean upon me and let us return to the camp	433.79217529296875
Yes said the man who could scarcely believe in such magnanimity but is it not to have me hanged	1128.4671630859375
You have my word said he for the second time I give you your life	92.37078094482422
The wounded man sank upon his knees to again kiss the feet of his preserver but DArtagnan who had no longer a motive for staying so near the enemy abridged the testimonials of his gratitude	336.7311706542969
The Guardsman who had returned at the first discharge announced the death of his four companions	2.000459671020508
They were therefore much astonished and delighted in the regiment when they saw the young man come back safe and sound	642.6173706054688
DArtagnan explained the sword wound of his companion by a sortie which he improvised	278.4933166503906
He described the death of the other soldier and the perils they had encountered	109.10053253173828
This recital was for him the occasion of veritable triumph	102.89690399169922
The whole army talked of this expedition for a day and Monsieur paid him his compliments upon it	183.6901092529297
Besides this as every great action bears its recompense with it the brave exploit of DArtagnan resulted in the restoration of the tranquility he had lost	382.456787109375
In fact DArtagnan believed that he might be tranquil as one of his two enemies was killed and the other devoted to his interests	55.43811798095703
This tranquillity proved one thingthat DArtagnan did not yet know Milady	21.742345809936523
Chapter XLII	177.5509033203125
THE ANJOU WINE	426.49969482421875
After the most disheartening news of the kings health a report of his convalescence began to prevail in the camp and as he was very anxious to be in person at the siege it was said that as soon as he could mount a horse he would set forward	327.3883972167969
Meantime Monsieur who knew that from one day to the other he might expect to be removed from his command by the Duc dAngoulme by Bassompierre or by Schomberg who were all eager for his post did but little lost his days in wavering and did not dare to attempt any great enterprise to drive the English from the Isle of R where they still besieged the citadel St	831.3847045898438
Martin and the fort of La Pre as on their side the French were besieging La Rochelle	29.694252014160156
DArtagnan as we have said had become more tranquil as always happens after a past danger particularly when the danger seems to have vanished	371.75653076171875
He only felt one uneasiness and that was at not hearing any tidings from his friends	58.42805862426758
But one morning at the commencement of the month of November everything was explained to him by this letter dated from Villeroy	179.8551025390625
DARTAGNAN MM	423.09912109375
Athos Porthos and Aramis after having had an entertainment at my house and enjoying themselves very much created such a disturbance that the provost of the castle a rigid man has ordered them to be confined for some days but I accomplish the order they have given me by forwarding to you a dozen bottles of my Anjou wine with which they are much pleased	390.42376708984375
They are desirous that you should drink to their health in their favorite wine	433.2284851074219
I have done this and am monsieur with great respect	898.7118530273438
Your very humble and obedient servant GODEAU Purveyor of the Musketeers	136.7354278564453
That s all well cried DArtagnan	121.60967254638672
They think of me in their pleasures as I thought of them in my troubles	717.2894287109375
Well I will certainly drink to their health with all my heart but I will not drink alone	509.1600341796875
And DArtagnan went among those Guardsmen with whom he had formed greater intimacy than with the others to invite them to enjoy with him this present of delicious Anjou wine which had been sent him from Villeroy	109.13060760498047
One of the two Guardsmen was engaged that evening and another the next so the meeting was fixed for the day after that	350.72467041015625
DArtagnan on his return sent the twelve bottles of wine to the refreshment room of the Guards with strict orders that great care should be taken of it and then on the day appointed as the dinner was fixed for midday DArtagnan sent Planchet at nine in the morning to assist in preparing everything for the entertainment	374.7621154785156
Planchet very proud of being raised to the dignity of landlord thought he would make all ready like an intelligent man and with this view called in the assistance of the lackey of one of his masters guests named Fourreau and the false soldier who had tried to kill DArtagnan and who belonging to no corps had entered into the service of DArtagnan or rather of Planchet after DArtagnan had saved his life	215.55140686035156
The hour of the banquet being come the two guards arrived took their places and the dishes were arranged on the table	819.3988647460938
Planchet waited towel on arm Fourreau uncorked the bottles and Brisemont which was the name of the convalescent poured the wine which was a little shaken by its journey carefully into decanters	99.60425567626953
Of this wine the first bottle being a little thick at the bottom Brisemont poured the lees into a glass and DArtagnan desired him to drink it for the poor devil had not yet recovered his strength	424.9049987792969
The guests having eaten the soup were about to lift the first glass of wine to their lips when all at once the cannon sounded from Fort Louis and Fort Neuf	91.51163482666016
The Guardsmen imagining this to be caused by some unexpected attack either of the besieged or the English sprang to their swords	128.8876495361328
DArtagnan not less forward than they did likewise and all ran out in order to repair to their posts	102.08778381347656
But scarcely were they out of the room before they were made aware of the cause of this noise	137.27471923828125
Cries of Live the king Live the cardinal resounded on every side and the drums were beaten in all directions	66.53446197509766
In short the king impatient as has been said had come by forced marches and had that moment arrived with all his household and a reinforcement of ten thousand troops	171.20919799804688
His Musketeers proceeded and followed him	78.85553741455078
DArtagnan placed in line with his company saluted with an expressive gesture his three friends whose eyes soon discovered him and M	3534.402587890625
de Trville who detected him at once	479.3591003417969
The ceremony of reception over the four friends were soon in one anothers arms	461.5718994140625
Pardieu cried DArtagnan you could not have arrived in better time the dinner can not have had time to get cold Can it gentlemen added the young man turning to the two Guards whom he introduced to his friends	4245.734375
Ah ah said Porthos it appears we are feasting	208.6027374267578
I hope said Aramis there are no women at your dinner	636.7797241210938
Is there any drinkable wine in your tavern asked Athos	118.77361297607422
Well pardieu there is yours my dear friend replied DArtagnan	112.82691192626953
Our wine said Athos astonished	54.69719696044922
Yes that you sent me	139.29042053222656
We sent you wine	139.29042053222656
You know very wellthe wine from the hills of Anjou	116.7242431640625
Yes I know what brand you are talking about	4210700.5
The wine you prefer	1060.841064453125
Well in the absence of champagne and chambertin you must content yourselves with that	123.39430236816406
And so connoisseurs in wine as we are we have sent you some Anjou wine said Porthos	98.29518127441406
Not exactly it is the wine that was sent by your order	12.774881362915039
On our account said the three Musketeers	390.81695556640625
Did you send this wine Aramis said Athos	157.19483947753906
No and you Porthos	85.88462829589844
No and you Athos	42.12807083129883
If it was not you it was your purveyor said DArtagnan	258.77099609375
Our purveyor	101.79782104492188
Yes your purveyor Godeauthe purveyor of the Musketeers	313.1120300292969
My faith never mind where it comes from said Porthos let us taste it and if it is good let us drink it	259.2420349121094
No said Athos do nt let us drink wine which comes from an unknown source	300.8905334472656
You are right Athos said DArtagnan	68.19469451904297
Did none of you charge your purveyor Godeau to send me some wine	175.18899536132812
No And yet you say he has sent you some as from us	65.15047454833984
Here is his letter said DArtagnan and he presented the note to his comrades	132.8237762451172
This is not his writing said Athos	240.0828857421875
I am acquainted with it before we left Villeroy I settled the accounts of the regiment	38.44026565551758
A false letter altogether said Porthos we have not been disciplined	244.2566375732422
DArtagnan said Aramis in a reproachful tone how could you believe that we had made a disturbance	63.66324234008789
DArtagnan grew pale and a convulsive trembling shook all his limbs	76.60874938964844
Thou alarmest me said Athos who never used thee and thou but upon very particular occasions what has happened	19.471757888793945
Look you my friends cried DArtagnan a horrible suspicion crosses my mind Can this be another vengeance of that woman	148.09432983398438
It was now Athos who turned pale	380.45379638671875
DArtagnan rushed toward the refreshment room the three Musketeers and the two Guards following him	120.03755187988281
The first object that met the eyes of DArtagnan on entering the room was Brisemont stretched upon the ground and rolling in horrible convulsions	267.013671875
Planchet and Fourreau as pale as death were trying to give him succor but it was plain that all assistance was uselessall the features of the dying man were distorted with agony	119.652099609375
Ah cried he on perceiving DArtagnan ah this is frightful You pretend to pardon me and you poison me	150.75917053222656
I cried DArtagnan	145.23719787597656
I wretch What do you say	210.357666015625
I say that it was you who gave me the wine I say that it was you who desired me to drink it	463.57049560546875
I say you wished to avenge yourself on me and I say that it is horrible	101.07080841064453
Do not think so Brisemont said DArtagnan do not think so	57.18989181518555
I swear to you I protest	109.79779052734375
Oh but God is above God will punish you My God grant that he may one day suffer what I suffer	44.79366683959961
Upon the Gospel said DArtagnan throwing himself down by the dying man I swear to you that the wine was poisoned and that I was going to drink of it as you did	820.157958984375
I do not believe you cried the soldier and he expired amid horrible tortures	117.07849884033203
Frightful frightful murmured Athos while Porthos broke the bottles and Aramis gave orders a little too late that a confessor should be sent for	43.218421936035156
Oh my friends said DArtagnan you come once more to save my life not only mine but that of these gentlemen	135.57635498046875
Gentlemen continued he addressing the Guardsmen I request you will be silent with regard to this adventure	530.8595581054688
Great personages may have had a hand in what you have seen and if talked about the evil would only recoil upon us	180.25631713867188
Ah monsieur stammered Planchet more dead than alive ah monsieur what an escape I have had	94.199462890625
How sirrah you were going to drink my wine	456.5319519042969
To the health of the king monsieur I was going to drink a small glass of it if Fourreau had not told me I was called	125.21477508544922
Alas said Fourreau whose teeth chattered with terror I wanted to get him out of the way that I might drink myself	23.345020294189453
Gentlemen said DArtagnan addressing the Guardsmen you may easily comprehend that such a feast can only be very dull after what has taken place so accept my excuses and put off the party till another day I beg of you	9.631996154785156
The two Guardsmen courteously accepted DArtagnans excuses and perceiving that the four friends desired to be alone retired	78.15534210205078
When the young Guardsman and the three Musketeers were without witnesses they looked at one another with an air which plainly expressed that each of them perceived the gravity of their situation	10.689953804016113
In the first place said Athos let us leave this chamber the dead are not agreeable company particularly when they have died a violent death	394.609130859375
Planchet said DArtagnan I commit the corpse of this poor devil to your care	1627.8443603515625
Let him be interred in holy ground	44.36061096191406
He committed a crime it is true but he repented of it	134.7784881591797
And the four friends quit the room leaving to Planchet and Fourreau the duty of paying mortuary honors to Brisemont	266.57781982421875
The host gave them another chamber and served them with fresh eggs and some water which Athos went himself to draw at the fountain	39.01295852661133
In a few words Porthos and Aramis were posted as to the situation	46.462032318115234
Well said DArtagnan to Athos you see my dear friend that this is war to the death	253.62608337402344
Athos shook his head	256.1185607910156
Yes yes replied he I perceive that plainly but do you really believe it is she	39.14765548706055
I am sure of it	99.34654998779297
Nevertheless I confess I still doubt	151.93064880371094
But the fleurdelis on her shoulder	62.23431396484375
She is some Englishwoman who has committed a crime in France and has been branded in consequence	121.85562133789062
Athos she is your wife I tell you repeated DArtagnan only reflect how much the two descriptions resemble each other	975.99658203125
Yes but I should think the other must be dead I hanged her so effectually	423.5617980957031
It was DArtagnan who now shook his head in his turn	917.922119140625
But in either case what is to be done said the young man	3.066758632659912
The fact is one can not remain thus with a sword hanging eternally over his head said Athos	659.6970825195312
We must extricate ourselves from this position	328.8562927246094
But how	386.08941650390625
Listen You must try to see her and have an explanation with her	74.18740844726562
Say to her Peace or war My word as a gentleman never to say anything of you never to do anything against you on your side a solemn oath to remain neutral with respect to me	23.59027671813965
If not I will apply to the chancellor I will apply to the king I will apply to the hangman I will move the courts against you I will denounce you as branded I will bring you to trial and if you are acquitted well by the faith of a gentleman I will kill you at the corner of some wall as I would a mad dog	52.92635726928711
I like the means well enough said DArtagnan but where and how to meet with her	78.50243377685547
Time dear friend time brings round opportunity opportunity is the martingale of man	75.30256652832031
The more we have ventured the more we gain when we know how to wait	366.2789611816406
Yes but to wait surrounded by assassins and poisoners	61.05641555786133
Bah said Athos	108.73693084716797
God has preserved us hitherto God will preserve us still	31.8505916595459
Yes we	17.27889633178711
Besides we are men and everything considered it is our lot to risk our lives but she asked he in an undertone	39.38263702392578
What she asked Athos	1.679030418395996
Madame Bonacieux Ah that s true said Athos	325.7452697753906
My poor friend I had forgotten you were in love	10.465692520141602
Well but said Aramis have you not learned by the letter you found on the wretched corpse that she is in a convent One may be very comfortable in a convent and as soon as the siege of La Rochelle is terminated I promise you on my part	29.15609359741211
Good cried Athos good Yes my dear Aramis we all know that your views have a religious tendency	42.583351135253906
I am only temporarily a Musketeer said Aramis humbly	84.81897735595703
It is some time since we heard from his mistress said Athos in a low voice	58.76911544799805
But take no notice we know all about that	42.24797058105469
Well said Porthos it appears to me that the means are very simple	1322.9378662109375
What asked DArtagnan	184.2216796875
You say she is in a convent replied Porthos	32.4592170715332
Very well	108.56688690185547
As soon as the siege is over well carry her off from that convent	97.88858032226562
But we must first learn what convent she is in	999.0721435546875
That s true said Porthos	776.2697143554688
But I think I have it said Athos	182.02734375
Do nt you say dear DArtagnan that it is the queen who has made choice of the convent for her	404.8917236328125
I believe so at least	2.000459671020508
In that case Porthos will assist us	154.60499572753906
And how so if you please	227.6804962158203
Why by your marchioness your duchess your princess	43.442962646484375
She must have a long arm	235.08924865722656
Hush said Porthos placing a finger on his lips	147.07798767089844
I believe her to be a cardinalist she must know nothing of the matter	734.6543579101562
Then said Aramis I take upon myself to obtain intelligence of her	66.90576934814453
You Aramis cried the three friends	45.58210754394531
You And how	124.33641815185547
By the queens almoner to whom I am very intimately allied said Aramis coloring	54.989566802978516
And on this assurance the four friends who had finished their modest repast separated with the promise of meeting again that evening	1.0454856157302856
DArtagnan returned to less important affairs and the three Musketeers repaired to the kings quarters where they had to prepare their lodging	434.3613586425781
Chapter XLIII	78.41841125488281
THE SIGN OF THE RED DOVECOT	605.4193725585938
Meanwhile the king who with more reason than the cardinal showed his hatred for Buckingham although scarcely arrived was in such a haste to meet the enemy that he commanded every disposition to be made to drive the English from the Isle of R and afterward to press the siege of La Rochelle but notwithstanding his earnest wish he was delayed by the dissensions which broke out between MM	248.76319885253906
Bassompierre and Schomberg against the Duc dAngoulme	371.58160400390625
Bassompierre and Schomberg were marshals of France and claimed their right of commanding the army under the orders of the king but the cardinal who feared that Bassompierre a Huguenot at heart might press but feebly the English and Rochellais his brothers in religion supported the Duc dAngoulme whom the king at his instigation had named lieutenant general	167.90988159179688
The result was that to prevent MM	144.85147094726562
Bassompierre and Schomberg from deserting the army a separate command had to be given to each	848.8692016601562
Bassompierre took up his quarters on the north of the city between Leu and Dompierre the Duc dAngoulme on the east from Dompierre to Perigny and M	953.5595092773438
de Schomberg on the south from Perigny to Angoutin	1161.366943359375
The quarters of Monsieur were at Dompierre the quarters of the king were sometimes at Estre sometimes at Jarrie the cardinals quarters were upon the downs at the bridge of La Pierre in a simple house without any entrenchment	126.1162338256836
So that Monsieur watched Bassompierre the king the Duc dAngoulme and the cardinal M	293.3396301269531
de Schomberg	225.39895629882812
As soon as this organization was established they set about driving the English from the Isle	571.6320190429688
The juncture was favorable	222.0056610107422
The English who require above everything good living in order to be good soldiers only eating salt meat and bad biscuit had many invalids in their camp	38.38166809082031
Still further the sea very rough at this period of the year all along the sea coast destroyed every day some little vessel and the shore from the point of lAiguillon to the trenches was at every tide literally covered with the wrecks of pinnacles roberges and feluccas	97.82852172851562
The result was that even if the kings troops remained quietly in their camp it was evident that some day or other Buckingham who only continued in the Isle from obstinacy would be obliged to raise the siege	399.229248046875
But as M	326.0360107421875
de Toiras gave information that everything was preparing in the enemys camp for a fresh assault the king judged that it would be best to put an end to the affair and gave the necessary orders for a decisive action	610.3651123046875
As it is not our intention to give a journal of the siege but on the contrary only to describe such of the events of it as are connected with the story we are relating we will content ourselves with saying in two words that the expedition succeeded to the great astonishment of the king and the great glory of the cardinal	1555.096923828125
The English repulsed foot by foot beaten in all encounters and defeated in the passage of the Isle of Loie were obliged to reembark leaving on the field of battle two thousand men among whom were five colonels three lieutenant colonels two hundred and fifty captains twenty gentlemen of rank four pieces of cannon and sixty flags which were taken to Paris by Claude de St	819.8639526367188
Simon and suspended with great pomp in the arches of Notre Dame	146.64808654785156
Te Deums were chanted in camp and afterward throughout France	102.30224609375
The cardinal was left free to carry on the siege without having at least at the present anything to fear on the part of the English	542.1412353515625
But it must be acknowledged this response was but momentary	528.1373291015625
An envoy of the Duke of Buckingham named Montague was taken and proof was obtained of a league between the German Empire Spain England and Lorraine	298.2314147949219
This league was directed against France	51.527774810791016
Still further in Buckinghams lodging which he had been forced to abandon more precipitately than he expected papers were found which confirmed this alliance and which as the cardinal asserts in his memoirs strongly compromised Mme	199.10537719726562
de Chevreuse and consequently the queen	62.12979507446289
It was upon the cardinal that all the responsibility fell for one is not a despotic minister without responsibility	202.57565307617188
All therefore of the vast resources of his genius were at work night and day engaged in listening to the least report heard in any of the great kingdoms of Europe	238.37181091308594
The cardinal was acquainted with the activity and more particularly the hatred of Buckingham	73.25543975830078
If the league which threatened France triumphed all his influence would be lost	755.6521606445312
Spanish policy and Austrian policy would have their representatives in the cabinet of the Louvre where they had as yet but partisans and he Richelieuthe French minister the national ministerwould be ruined	166.71246337890625
The king even while obeying him like a child hated him as a child hates his master and would abandon him to the personal vengeance of Monsieur and the queen	372.9747314453125
He would then be lost and France perhaps with him	235.15853881835938
All this must be prepared against	21.055761337280273
Courtiers becoming every instant more numerous succeeded one another day and night in the little house of the bridge of La Pierre in which the cardinal had established his residence	688.4596557617188
There were monks who wore the frock with such an ill grace that it was easy to perceive they belonged to the church militant women a little inconvenienced by their costume as pages and whose large trousers could not entirely conceal their rounded forms and peasants with blackened hands but with fine limbs savoring of the man of quality a league off	142.89825439453125
There were also less agreeable visitsfor two or three times reports were spread that the cardinal had nearly been assassinated	1147.0045166015625
It is true that the enemies of the cardinal said that it was he himself who set these bungling assassins to work in order to have if wanted the right of using reprisals but we must not believe everything ministers say nor everything their enemies say	27.8023681640625
These attempts did not prevent the cardinal to whom his most inveterate detractors have never denied personal bravery from making nocturnal excursions sometimes to communicate to the Duc dAngoulme important orders sometimes to confer with the king and sometimes to have an interview with a messenger whom he did not wish to see at home	99.9073486328125
On their part the Musketeers who had not much to do with the siege were not under very strict orders and led a joyous life	343.72760009765625
This was the more easy for our three companions in particular for being friends of M	185.67921447753906
de Trville they obtained from him special permission to be absent after the closing of the camp	9891.087890625
Now one evening when DArtagnan who was in the trenches was not able to accompany them Athos Porthos and Aramis mounted on their battle steeds enveloped in their war cloaks with their hands upon their pistol butts were returning from a drinking place called the Red Dovecot which Athos had discovered two days before upon the route to Jarrie following the road which led to the camp and quite on their guard as we have stated for fear of an ambuscade when about a quarter of a league from the village of Boisnau they fancied they heard the sound of horses approaching them	22.55794334411621
They immediately all three halted closed in and waited occupying the middle of the road	79.96720123291016
In an instant and as the moon broke from behind a cloud they saw at a turning of the road two horsemen who on perceiving them stopped in their turn appearing to deliberate whether they should continue their route or go back	364.7662658691406
The hesitation created some suspicion in the three friends and Athos advancing a few paces in front of the others cried in a firm voice Who goes there	195.83663940429688
Who goes there yourselves replied one of the horsemen	32.135013580322266
That is not an answer replied Athos	63.53293228149414
Who goes there Answer or we charge	78.52193450927734
Beware of what you are about gentlemen said a clear voice which seemed accustomed to command	122.03163146972656
It is some superior officer making his night rounds said Athos	257.3641052246094
What do you wish gentlemen	265.7873229980469
Who are you said the same voice in the same commanding tone	122.61918640136719
Answer in your turn or you may repent of your disobedience	57.15870666503906
Kings Musketeers said Athos more and more convinced that he who interrogated them had the right to do so	61.32072830200195
What company	152.14698791503906
Company of Trville	103.68479919433594
Advance and give an account of what you are doing here at this hour	646.097900390625
The three companions advanced rather humblyfor all were now convinced that they had to do with someone more powerful than themselvesleaving Athos the post of speaker	228.36221313476562
One of the two riders he who had spoken second was ten paces in front of his companion	479.123779296875
Athos made a sign to Porthos and Aramis also to remain in the rear and advanced alone	75.90250396728516
Your pardon my officer said Athos but we were ignorant with whom we had to do and you may see that we were keeping good guard	179.6946258544922
Your name said the officer who covered a part of his face with his cloak	107.76199340820312
But yourself monsieur said Athos who began to be annoyed by this inquisition give me I beg you the proof that you have the right to question me	135.5137939453125
Your name repeated the cavalier a second time letting his cloak fall and leaving his face uncovered	37.701988220214844
Monsieur the Cardinal cried the stupefied Musketeer	49.68861389160156
Your name cried his Eminence for the third time	81.40789031982422
Athos said the Musketeer	87.63414764404297
The cardinal made a sign to his attendant who drew near	85.15753173828125
These three Musketeers shall follow us said he in an undertone	148.7830352783203
I am not willing it should be known I have left the camp and if they follow us we shall be certain they will tell nobody	40.971614837646484
We are gentlemen monseigneur said Athos require our parole and give yourself no uneasiness	145.4641876220703
Thank God we can keep a secret	174.14341735839844
The cardinal fixed his piercing eyes on this courageous speaker	543.7484741210938
You have a quick ear Monsieur Athos said the cardinal but now listen to this	2511.768798828125
It is not from mistrust that I request you to follow me but for my security	148.22723388671875
Your companions are no doubt Messieurs Porthos and Aramis	151.22608947753906
Yes your Eminence said Athos while the two Musketeers who had remained behind advanced hat in hand	163.78195190429688
I know you gentlemen said the cardinal I know you	23.84691047668457
I know you are not quite my friends and I am sorry you are not so but I know you are brave and loyal gentlemen and that confidence may be placed in you	204.9457550048828
Monsieur Athos do me then the honor to accompany me you and your two friends and then I shall have an escort to excite envy in his Majesty if we should meet him	15.941970825195312
The three Musketeers bowed to the necks of their horses	548.3186645507812
Well upon my honor said Athos your Eminence is right in taking us with you we have seen several illlooking faces on the road and we have even had a quarrel at the Red Dovecot with four of those faces	142.71038818359375
A quarrel and what for gentlemen said the cardinal you know I do nt like quarrelers	100.96223449707031
And that is the reason why I have the honor to inform your Eminence of what has happened for you might learn it from others and upon a false account believe us to be in fault	370.12640380859375
What have been the results of your quarrel said the cardinal knitting his brow	621.8446044921875
My friend Aramis here has received a slight sword wound in the arm but not enough to prevent him as your Eminence may see from mounting to the assault tomorrow if your Eminence orders an escalade	81.80882263183594
But you are not the men to allow sword wounds to be inflicted upon you thus said the cardinal	186.12384033203125
Come be frank gentlemen you have settled accounts with somebody Confess you know I have the right of giving absolution	270.7662353515625
I monseigneur said Athos	78.45708465576172
I did not even draw my sword but I took him who offended me round the body and threw him out of the window	128.31607055664062
It appears that in falling continued Athos with some hesitation he broke his thigh	74.77792358398438
Ah ah said the cardinal and you Monsieur Porthos	105.3822021484375
I monseigneur knowing that dueling is prohibitedI seized a bench and gave one of those brigands such a blow that I believe his shoulder is broken	47.306644439697266
Very well said the cardinal and you Monsieur Aramis	101.87026977539062
Monseigneur being of a very mild disposition and being likewise of which Monseigneur perhaps is not aware about to enter into orders I endeavored to appease my comrades when one of these wretches gave me a wound with a sword treacherously across my left arm	34.613311767578125
Then I admit my patience failed me I drew my sword in my turn and as he came back to the charge I fancied I felt that in throwing himself upon me he let it pass through his body	160.14747619628906
I only know for a certainty that he fell and it seemed to me that he was borne away with his two companions	1006.5665893554688
The devil gentlemen said the cardinal three men placed hors de combat in a cabaret squabble You do nt do your work by halves	56.514068603515625
And pray what was this quarrel about	88.95211029052734
These fellows were drunk said Athos and knowing there was a lady who had arrived at the cabaret this evening they wanted to force her door	71.35931396484375
Force her door said the cardinal and for what purpose	363.82159423828125
To do her violence without doubt said Athos	765.45068359375
I have had the honor of informing your Eminence that these men were drunk	333.5818786621094
And was this lady young and handsome asked the cardinal with a certain degree of anxiety	71.85883331298828
We did not see her monseigneur said Athos	1142.6552734375
You did not see her Ah very well replied the cardinal quickly	195.80862426757812
You did well to defend the honor of a woman and as I am going to the Red Dovecot myself I shall know if you have told me the truth	218.44268798828125
Monseigneur said Athos haughtily we are gentlemen and to save our heads we would not be guilty of a falsehood	37.030181884765625
Therefore I do not doubt what you say Monsieur Athos I do not doubt it for a single instant but added he to change the conversation was this lady alone	76.29865264892578
The lady had a cavalier shut up with her said Athos but as notwithstanding the noise this cavalier did not show himself it is to be presumed that he is a coward	109.94033813476562
Judge not rashly says the Gospel replied the cardinal	549.608642578125
Athos bowed	165.0828857421875
And now gentlemen that s well continued the cardinal	22.864490509033203
I know what I wish to know follow me	117.99742126464844
The three Musketeers passed behind his Eminence who again enveloped his face in his cloak and put his horse in motion keeping from eight to ten paces in advance of his four companions	117.56620788574219
They soon arrived at the silent solitary inn	89.20675659179688
No doubt the host knew what illustrious visitor was expected and had consequently sent intruders out of the way	99.72163391113281
Ten paces from the door the cardinal made a sign to his esquire and the three Musketeers to halt	65.82362365722656
A saddled horse was fastened to the window shutter	63.66142272949219
The cardinal knocked three times and in a peculiar manner	94.37678527832031
A man enveloped in a cloak came out immediately and exchanged some rapid words with the cardinal after which he mounted his horse and set off in the direction of Surgres which was likewise the way to Paris	2.000459671020508
Advance gentlemen said the cardinal	21.4534912109375
You have told me the truth my gentlemen said he addressing the Musketeers and it will not be my fault if our encounter this evening be not advantageous to you	631.6383666992188
In the meantime follow me	187.8796844482422
The cardinal alighted the three Musketeers did likewise	493.3138732910156
The cardinal threw the bridle of his horse to his esquire the three Musketeers fastened the horses to the shutters	53.10799789428711
The host stood at the door	299.9897155761719
For him the cardinal was only an officer coming to visit a lady	254.0535888671875
Have you any chamber on the ground floor where these gentlemen can wait near a good fire said the cardinal	202.1900177001953
The host opened the door of a large room in which an old stove had just been replaced by a large and excellent chimney	74.26416778564453
I have this said he	27.725753784179688
That will do replied the cardinal	46.70298767089844
Enter gentlemen and be kind enough to wait for me I shall not be more than half an hour	362.15411376953125
And while the three Musketeers entered the ground floor room the cardinal without asking further information ascended the staircase like a man who has no need of having his road pointed out to him	261.2362060546875
Chapter XLIV	408.18896484375
THE UTILITY OF STOVEPIPES	392.2291259765625
It was evident that without suspecting it and actuated solely by their chivalrous and adventurous character our three friends had just rendered a service to someone the cardinal honored with his special protection	171.19776916503906
Now who was that someone That was the question the three Musketeers put to one another	52.358280181884766
Then seeing that none of their replies could throw any light on the subject Porthos called the host and asked for dice	209.16201782226562
Porthos and Aramis placed themselves at the table and began to play	61.72189712524414
Athos walked about in a contemplative mood	14848.8486328125
While thinking and walking Athos passed and repassed before the pipe of the stove broken in halves the other extremity passing into the chamber above and every time he passed and repassed he heard a murmur of words which at length fixed his attention	32.65349578857422
Athos went close to it and distinguished some words that appeared to merit so great an interest that he made a sign to his friends to be silent remaining himself bent with his ear directed to the opening of the lower orifice	37.13478088378906
Listen Milady said the cardinal the affair is important	91.11766815185547
Sit down and let us talk it over	59.419124603271484
Milady murmured Athos	464.581787109375
I listen to your Eminence with greatest attention replied a female voice which made the Musketeer start	103.6761474609375
A small vessel with an English crew whose captain is on my side awaits you at the mouth of Charente at Fort La Pointe	30.89973258972168
He will set sail tomorrow morning	71.2197036743164
Fort La Pointe or Fort Vasou was not built until 1672 nearly 50 years later	41.331756591796875
I must go thither tonight	76.3095703125
Instantly That is to say when you have received my instructions	179.42398071289062
Two men whom you will find at the door on going out will serve you as escort	56.99882888793945
You will allow me to leave first then after half an hour you can go away in your turn	582.8286743164062
Yes monseigneur	85.44461059570312
Now let us return to the mission with which you wish to charge me and as I desire to continue to merit the confidence of your Eminence deign to unfold it to me in terms clear and precise that I may not commit an error	171.7476348876953
There was an instant of profound silence between the two interlocutors	49.74425506591797
It was evident that the cardinal was weighing beforehand the terms in which he was about to speak and that Milady was collecting all her intellectual faculties to comprehend the things he was about to say and to engrave them in her memory when they should be spoken	90.31607055664062
Athos took advantage of this moment to tell his two companions to fasten the door inside and to make them a sign to come and listen with him	93.8634033203125
The two Musketeers who loved their ease brought a chair for each of themselves and one for Athos	128.8036651611328
All three then sat down with their heads together and their ears on the alert	174.94065856933594
You will go to London continued the cardinal	78.2552490234375
Arrived in London you will seek Buckingham	40.86164855957031
I must beg your Eminence to observe said Milady that since the affair of the diamond studs about which the duke always suspected me his Grace distrusts me	24317.03125
Well this time said the cardinal it is not necessary to steal his confidence but to present yourself frankly and loyally as a negotiator	102.5741195678711
Frankly and loyally repeated Milady with an unspeakable expression of duplicity	594.1380615234375
Yes frankly and loyally replied the cardinal in the same tone	56.01804733276367
All this negotiation must be carried on openly	18.485307693481445
I will follow your Eminences instructions to the letter	81.75590515136719
I only wait till you give them	398.0795593261719
You will go to Buckingham in my behalf and you will tell him I am acquainted with all the preparations he has made but that they give me no uneasiness since at the first step he takes I will ruin the queen	94.12003326416016
Will he believe that your Eminence is in a position to accomplish the threat thus made	200.97225952148438
Yes for I have the proofs	23.985830307006836
I must be able to present these proofs for his appreciation	38.83681106567383
Without doubt	1014.3049926757812
And you will tell him I will publish the report of BoisRobert and the Marquis de Beautru upon the interview which the duke had at the residence of Madame the Constable with the queen on the evening Madame the Constable gave a masquerade	192.9515838623047
You will tell him in order that he may not doubt that he came there in the costume of the Great Mogul which the Chevalier de Guise was to have worn and that he purchased this exchange for the sum of three thousand pistoles	199.7529754638672
Well monseigneur	220.7006378173828
All the details of his coming into and going out of the palaceon the night when he introduced himself in the character of an Italian fortune telleryou will tell him that he may not doubt the correctness of my information that he had under his cloak a large white robe dotted with black tears deaths heads and crossbonesfor in case of a surprise he was to pass for the phantom of the White Lady who as all the world knows appears at the Louvre every time any great event is impending	65.682373046875
Is that all monseigneur	123.85095977783203
Tell him also that I am acquainted with all the details of the adventure at Amiens that I will have a little romance made of it wittily turned with a plan of the garden and portraits of the principal actors in that nocturnal romance	27.21478843688965
I will tell him that	7.8506340980529785
Tell him further that I hold Montague in my power that Montague is in the Bastille that no letters were found upon him it is true but that torture may make him tell much of what he knows and even what he does not know	150.5065460205078
Then add that his Grace has in the precipitation with which he quit the Isle of R forgotten and left behind him in his lodging a certain letter from Madame de Chevreuse which singularly compromises the queen inasmuch as it proves not only that her Majesty can love the enemies of the king but that she can conspire with the enemies of France	195.53672790527344
You recollect perfectly all I have told you do you not	46.44990158081055
Your Eminence will judge the ball of Madame the Constable the night at the Louvre the evening at Amiens the arrest of Montague the letter of Madame de Chevreuse	156.22535705566406
That s it said the cardinal that s it	104.39401245117188
You have an excellent memory Milady	15.185078620910645
But resumed she to whom the cardinal addressed this flattering compliment if in spite of all these reasons the duke does not give way and continues to menace France	259.7239685058594
The duke is in love to madness or rather to folly replied Richelieu with great bitterness	223.7391815185547
Like the ancient paladins he has only undertaken this war to obtain a look from his lady love	165.4817657470703
If he becomes certain that this war will cost the honor and perhaps the liberty of the lady of his thoughts as he says I will answer for it he will look twice	3.918487548828125
And yet said Milady with a persistence that proved she wished to see clearly to the end of the mission with which she was about to be charged if he persists	108.51602172851562
If he persists said the cardinal	206.89215087890625
That is not probable	93.02606964111328
It is possible said Milady	90.94725036621094
If he persists His Eminence made a pause and resumed If he persistswell then I shall hope for one of those events which change the destinies of states	173.35626220703125
If your Eminence would quote to me some one of these events in history said Milady perhaps I should partake of your confidence as to the future	216.07325744628906
Well here for example said Richelieu when in 1610 for a cause similar to that which moves the duke King Henry IV	233.75538635253906
of glorious memory was about at the same time to invade Flanders and Italy in order to attack Austria on both sides	605.56494140625
Well did there not happen an event which saved Austria Why should not the king of France have the same chance as the emperor	83.05818176269531
Your Eminence means I presume the knife stab in the Rue de la Feronnerie	173.32525634765625
Precisely said the cardinal	272.5537414550781
Does not your Eminence fear that the punishment inflicted upon Ravaillac may deter anyone who might entertain the idea of imitating him	46.029579162597656
There will be in all times and in all countries particularly if religious divisions exist in those countries fanatics who ask nothing better than to become martyrs	11.17987060546875
Ay and observeit just occurs to me that the Puritans are furious against Buckingham and their preachers designate him as the Antichrist	24.299074172973633
Well said Milady	308.3345642089844
Well continued the cardinal in an indifferent tone the only thing to be sought for at this moment is some woman handsome young and clever who has cause of quarrel with the duke	182.2130889892578
The duke has had many affairs of gallantry and if he has fostered his amours by promises of eternal constancy he must likewise have sown the seeds of hatred by his eternal infidelities	100.78623962402344
No doubt said Milady coolly such a woman may be found	274.7124938964844
Well such a woman who would place the knife of Jacques Clment or of Ravaillac in the hands of a fanatic would save France	38.04643249511719
Yes but she would then be the accomplice of an assassination	75.34684753417969
Were the accomplices of Ravaillac or of Jacques Clment ever known	27.324020385742188
No for perhaps they were too highplaced for anyone to dare look for them where they were	269.068115234375
The Palace of Justice would not be burned down for everybody monseigneur	43.524967193603516
You think then that the fire at the Palace of Justice was not caused by chance asked Richelieu in the tone with which he would have put a question of no importance	84.73970031738281
I monseigneur replied Milady	328.1626892089844
I think nothing I quote a fact that is all	39.54645919799805
Only I say that if I were named Madame de Montpensier or the Queen Marie de Mdicis I should use less precautions than I take being simply called Milady Clarik	467.9064025878906
That is just said Richelieu	55.65987014770508
What do you require then	35.337738037109375
I require an order which would ratify beforehand all that I should think proper to do for the greatest good of France	30.78591537475586
But in the first place this woman I have described must be found who is desirous of avenging herself upon the duke	49.30126190185547
She is found said Milady	49.00632858276367
Then the miserable fanatic must be found who will serve as an instrument of Gods justice	322.8128967285156
He will be found	273.4565124511719
Well said the cardinal then it will be time to claim the order which you just now required	73.94142150878906
Your Eminence is right replied Milady and I have been wrong in seeing in the mission with which you honor me anything but that which it really isthat is to announce to his Grace on the part of your Eminence that you are acquainted with the different disguises by means of which he succeeded in approaching the queen during the fte given by Madame the Constable that you have proofs of the interview granted at the Louvre by the queen to a certain Italian astrologer who was no other than the Duke of Buckingham that you have ordered a little romance of a satirical nature to be written upon the adventures of Amiens with a plan of the gardens in which those adventures took place and portraits of the actors who figured in them that Montague is in the Bastille and that the torture may make him say things he remembers and even things he has forgotten that you possess a certain letter from Madame de Chevreuse found in his Graces lodging which singularly compromises not only her who wrote it but her in whose name it was written	36.381683349609375
Then if he persists notwithstanding all thisas that is as I have said the limit of my missionI shall have nothing to do but to pray God to work a miracle for the salvation of France	64.11497497558594
That is it is it not monseigneur and I shall have nothing else to do	164.95989990234375
That is it replied the cardinal dryly	229.13796997070312
And now said Milady without appearing to remark the change of the dukes tone toward hernow that I have received the instructions of your Eminence as concerns your enemies Monseigneur will permit me to say a few words to him of mine	27.371416091918945
Have you enemies then asked Richelieu	403.2187805175781
Yes monseigneur enemies against whom you owe me all your support for I made them by serving your Eminence	14.184961318969727
Who are they replied the duke	167.03504943847656
In the first place there is a little intrigante named Bonacieux	286.87255859375
She is in the prison of Nantes	175.39796447753906
That is to say she was there replied Milady but the queen has obtained an order from the king by means of which she has been conveyed to a convent	42.377662658691406
To a convent said the duke	421.53399658203125
Yes to a convent	27.471542358398438
And to which	80.04182434082031
I do nt know the secret has been well kept	79.8719711303711
But I will know	63.72514343261719
And your Eminence will tell me in what convent that woman is	130.16371154785156
I can see nothing inconvenient in that said the cardinal	1511.854248046875
Well now I have an enemy much more to be dreaded by me than this little Madame Bonacieux	78.46939086914062
Who is that	66.2108154296875
Her lover	244.4449462890625
What is his name	132.08538818359375
Oh your Eminence knows him well cried Milady carried away by her anger	57.405677795410156
He is the evil genius of both of us	5137.92236328125
It is he who in an encounter with your Eminences Guards decided the victory in favor of the kings Musketeers it is he who gave three desperate wounds to De Wardes your emissary and who caused the affair of the diamond studs to fail it is he who knowing it was I who had Madame Bonacieux carried off has sworn my death	315.5218811035156
Ah ah said the cardinal I know of whom you speak	864.0482788085938
I mean that miserable DArtagnan	62.80122375488281
He is a bold fellow said the cardinal	50.7581901550293
And it is exactly because he is a bold fellow that he is the more to be feared	25.355241775512695
I must have said the duke a proof of his connection with Buckingham	18.04052734375
A proof cried Milady I will have ten	105.77215576171875
Well then it becomes the simplest thing in the world get me that proof and I will send him to the Bastille	76.978515625
So far good monseigneur but afterwards	89.55474853515625
When once in the Bastille there is no afterward said the cardinal in a low voice	553.048095703125
Ah pardieu continued he if it were as easy for me to get rid of my enemy as it is easy to get rid of yours and if it were against such people you require impunity	349.1996154785156
Monseigneur replied Milady a fair exchange	11.585463523864746
Life for life man for man give me one I will give you the other	72.80821990966797
I do nt know what you mean nor do I even desire to know what you mean replied the cardinal but I wish to please you and see nothing out of the way in giving you what you demand with respect to so infamous a creaturethe more so as you tell me this DArtagnan is a libertine a duelist and a traitor	69.14845275878906
An infamous scoundrel monseigneur a scoundrel	91.53581237792969
Give me paper a quill and some ink then said the cardinal	2.000459671020508
Here they are monseigneur	1943.8035888671875
There was a moment of silence which proved that the cardinal was employed in seeking the terms in which he should write the note or else in writing it	49.405208587646484
Athos who had not lost a word of the conversation took his two companions by the hand and led them to the other end of the room	21.3350887298584
Well said Porthos what do you want and why do you not let us listen to the end of the conversation	34.48977279663086
Hush said Athos speaking in a low voice	96.93672943115234
We have heard all it was necessary we should hear besides I do nt prevent you from listening but I must be gone	46.48103332519531
You must be gone said Porthos and if the cardinal asks for you what answer can we make	51.24549102783203
You will not wait till he asks you will speak first and tell him that I am gone on the lookout because certain expressions of our host have given me reason to think the road is not safe	158.37417602539062
I will say two words about it to the cardinals esquire likewise	93.85476684570312
The rest concerns myself do nt be uneasy about that	125.88984680175781
Be prudent Athos said Aramis	269.02923583984375
Be easy on that head replied Athos you know I am cool enough	183.68321228027344
Porthos and Aramis resumed their places by the stovepipe	56.630470275878906
As to Athos he went out without any mystery took his horse which was tied with those of his friends to the fastenings of the shutters in four words convinced the attendant of the necessity of a vanguard for their return carefully examined the priming of his pistols drew his sword and took like a forlorn hope the road to the camp	32.6812629699707
Chapter XLV	235.03164672851562
A CONJUGAL SCENE	405.28076171875
As Athos had foreseen it was not long before the cardinal came down	235.46563720703125
He opened the door of the room in which the Musketeers were and found Porthos playing an earnest game of dice with Aramis	196.57041931152344
He cast a rapid glance around the room and perceived that one of his men was missing	337.6154479980469
What has become of Monseigneur Athos asked he	434.3866882324219
Monseigneur replied Porthos he has gone as a scout on account of some words of our host which made him believe the road was not safe	98.91313934326172
And you what have you done Monsieur Porthos	56.00680160522461
I have won five pistoles of Aramis	472.2823486328125
Well now will you return with me	43.29355239868164
We are at your Eminences orders	205.46690368652344
To horse then gentlemen for it is getting late	274.00994873046875
The attendant was at the door holding the cardinals horse by the bridle	265.18572998046875
At a short distance a group of two men and three horses appeared in the shade	57.09311294555664
These were the two men who were to conduct Milady to Fort La Pointe and superintend her embarkation	60.782108306884766
The attendant confirmed to the cardinal what the two Musketeers had already said with respect to Athos	231.9906768798828
The cardinal made an approving gesture and retraced his route with the same precautions he had used in coming	11.69087028503418
Let us leave him to follow the road to the camp protected by his esquire and the two Musketeers and return to Athos	47.088096618652344
For a hundred paces he maintained the speed at which he started but when out of sight he turned his horse to the right made a circuit and came back within twenty paces of a high hedge to watch the passage of the little troop	30.485244750976562
Having recognized the laced hats of his companions and the golden fringe of the cardinals cloak he waited till the horsemen had turned the angle of the road and having lost sight of them he returned at a gallop to the inn which was opened to him without hesitation	84.48129272460938
The host recognized him	56.777992248535156
My officer said Athos has forgotten to give a piece of very important information to the lady and has sent me back to repair his forgetfulness	26.05732536315918
Go up said the host she is still in her chamber	400.9640197753906
Athos availed himself of the permission ascended the stairs with his lightest step gained the landing and through the open door perceived Milady putting on her hat	303.0577697753906
He entered the chamber and closed the door behind him	172.26370239257812
At the noise he made in pushing the bolt Milady turned round	254.75657653808594
Athos was standing before the door enveloped in his cloak with his hat pulled down over his eyes	223.46910095214844
On seeing this figure mute and immovable as a statue Milady was frightened	260.6733703613281
Who are you and what do you want cried she	2962.45751953125
Humph murmured Athos it is certainly she	470.7117004394531
And letting fall his cloak and raising his hat he advanced toward Milady	489.48773193359375
Do you know me madame said he	740.6796875
Milady made one step forward and then drew back as if she had seen a serpent	65.24262237548828
So far well said Athos I perceive you know me	940.5274047851562
The Comte de la Fre murmured Milady becoming exceedingly pale and drawing back till the wall prevented her from going any farther	181.7915802001953
Yes Milady replied Athos the Comte de la Fre in person who comes expressly from the other world to have the pleasure of paying you a visit	90.49052429199219
Sit down madame and let us talk as the cardinal said	128.9600830078125
Milady under the influence of inexpressible terror sat down without uttering a word	24.512840270996094
You certainly are a demon sent upon the earth said Athos	133.74176025390625
Your power is great I know but you also know that with the help of God men have often conquered the most terrible demons	94.24065399169922
You have once before thrown yourself in my path	159.8583221435547
I thought I had crushed you madame but either I was deceived or hell has resuscitated you	215.82859802246094
Milady at these words which recalled frightful remembrances hung down her head with a suppressed groan	70.36590576171875
Yes hell has resuscitated you continued Athos	55.85544967651367
Hell has made you rich hell has given you another name hell has almost made you another face but it has neither effaced the stains from your soul nor the brand from your body	87.7752914428711
Milady arose as if moved by a powerful spring and her eyes flashed lightning	126.3819580078125
Athos remained sitting	32.2924690246582
You believed me to be dead did you not as I believed you to be And the name of Athos as well concealed the Comte de la Fre as the name Milady Clarik concealed Anne de Breuil	75.89389038085938
Was it not so you were called when your honored brother married us Our position is truly a strange one continued Athos laughing	75.90406036376953
We have only lived up to the present time because we believed each other dead and because a remembrance is less oppressive than a living creature though a remembrance is sometimes devouring	40.6077995300293
But said Milady in a hollow faint voice what brings you back to me and what do you want with me	259.6386413574219
I wish to tell you that though remaining invisible to your eyes I have not lost sight of you	123.8465347290039
You know what I have done	539.62451171875
I can relate to you day by day your actions from your entrance to the service of the cardinal to this evening	124.71733093261719
A smile of incredulity passed over the pale lips of Milady	497.74493408203125
Listen It was you who cut off the two diamond studs from the shoulder of the Duke of Buckingham it was you who had Madame Bonacieux carried off it was you who in love with De Wardes and thinking to pass the night with him opened the door to Monsieur dArtagnan it was you who believing that De Wardes had deceived you wished to have him killed by his rival it was you who when this rival had discovered your infamous secret wished to have him killed in his turn by two assassins whom you sent in pursuit of him it was you who finding the balls had missed their mark sent poisoned wine with a forged letter to make your victim believe that the wine came from his friends	534.830078125
In short it was you who have but now in this chamber seated in this chair I now fill made an engagement with Cardinal Richelieu to cause the Duke of Buckingham to be assassinated in exchange for the promise he has made you to allow you to assassinate DArtagnan	598.9169311523438
Milady was livid	236.18588256835938
You must be Satan cried she	277.3858642578125
Perhaps said Athos But at all events listen well to this	159.43170166015625
Assassinate the Duke of Buckingham or cause him to be assassinatedI care very little about that I do nt know him	214.67144775390625
Besides he is an Englishman	145.84945678710938
But do not touch with the tip of your finger a single hair of DArtagnan who is a faithful friend whom I love and defend or I swear to you by the head of my father the crime which you shall have endeavored to commit or shall have committed shall be the last	214.3897247314453
Monsieur dArtagnan has cruelly insulted me said Milady in a hollow tone Monsieur dArtagnan shall die	100.79705047607422
Indeed Is it possible to insult you madame said Athos laughing he has insulted you and he shall die	12.147361755371094
He shall die replied Milady she first and he afterward	112.27937316894531
Athos was seized with a kind of vertigo	60.49908447265625
The sight of this creature who had nothing of the woman about her recalled awful remembrances	185.36790466308594
He thought how one day in a less dangerous situation than the one in which he was now placed he had already endeavored to sacrifice her to his honor	96.37477111816406
His desire for blood returned burning his brain and pervading his frame like a raging fever he arose in his turn reached his hand to his belt drew forth a pistol and cocked it	433.6552734375
Milady pale as a corpse endeavored to cry out but her swollen tongue could utter no more than a hoarse sound which had nothing human in it and resembled the rattle of a wild beast	381.098388671875
Motionless against the dark tapestry with her hair in disorder she appeared like a horrid image of terror	63.25148010253906
Athos slowly raised his pistol stretched out his arm so that the weapon almost touched Miladys forehead and then in a voice the more terrible from having the supreme calmness of a fixed resolution Madame said he you will this instant deliver to me the paper the cardinal signed or upon my soul I will blow your brains out	46.63520431518555
With another man Milady might have preserved some doubt but she knew Athos	35.98814392089844
Nevertheless she remained motionless	989.4413452148438
You have one second to decide said he	60.55669021606445
Milady saw by the contraction of his countenance that the trigger was about to be pulled she reached her hand quickly to her bosom drew out a paper and held it toward Athos	119.96442413330078
Take it said she and be accursed	27.59196662902832
Athos took the paper returned the pistol to his belt approached the lamp to be assured that it was the paper unfolded it and read	156.28131103515625
3 1627	523.1763916015625
It is by my order and for the good of the state that the bearer of this has done what he has done	104.03419494628906
And now said Athos resuming his cloak and putting on his hat now that I have drawn your teeth viper bite if you can	84.94429016113281
And he left the chamber without once looking behind him	171.4224853515625
At the door he found the two men and the spare horse which they held	53.47740936279297
Gentlemen said he Monseigneurs order is you know to conduct that woman without losing time to Fort La Pointe and never to leave her till she is on board	183.81227111816406
As these words agreed wholly with the order they had received they bowed their heads in sign of assent	126.51665496826172
With regard to Athos he leaped lightly into the saddle and set out at full gallop only instead of following the road he went across the fields urging his horse to the utmost and stopping occasionally to listen	121.16219329833984
In one of those halts he heard the steps of several horses on the road	850.7250366210938
He had no doubt it was the cardinal and his escort	146.84120178222656
He immediately made a new point in advance rubbed his horse down with some heath and leaves of trees and placed himself across the road about two hundred paces from the camp	2.000459671020508
Who goes there cried he as soon as he perceived the horsemen	2745.177734375
That is our brave Musketeer I think said the cardinal	214.74066162109375
Yes monseigneur said Porthos it is he	217.4081268310547
Monsieur Athos said Richelieu receive my thanks for the good guard you have kept	86.93053436279297
Gentlemen we are arrived take the gate on the left	53.38853454589844
The watchword is King and R	211.80442810058594
Saying these words the cardinal saluted the three friends with an inclination of his head and took the right hand followed by his attendantfor that night he himself slept in the camp	57.91984939575195
Well said Porthos and Aramis together as soon as the cardinal was out of hearing well he signed the paper she required	4.216803550720215
I know it said Athos coolly since here it is	290.4974060058594
And the three friends did not exchange another word till they reached their quarters except to give the watchword to the sentinels	861.04248046875
Only they sent Mousqueton to tell Planchet that his master was requested the instant that he left the trenches to come to the quarters of the Musketeers	42.39860916137695
Milady as Athos had foreseen on finding the two men that awaited her made no difficulty in following them	258.62359619140625
She had had for an instant an inclination to be reconducted to the cardinal and relate everything to him but a revelation on her part would bring about a revelation on the part of Athos	358.43890380859375
She might say that Athos had hanged her but then Athos would tell that she was branded	371.3897399902344
She thought it was best to preserve silence to discreetly set off to accomplish her difficult mission with her usual skill and then all things being accomplished to the satisfaction of the cardinal to come to him and claim her vengeance	927.6132202148438
In consequence after having traveled all night at seven oclock she was at the fort of the Point at eight oclock she had embarked and at nine the vessel which with letters of marque from the cardinal was supposed to be sailing for Bayonne raised anchor and steered its course toward England	215.3685302734375
Chapter XLVI	30.601552963256836
THE BASTION SAINTGERVAIS	156.77146911621094
On arriving at the lodgings of his three friends DArtagnan found them assembled in the same chamber	95.21990966796875
Athos was meditating Porthos was twisting his mustache Aramis was saying his prayers in a charming little Book of Hours bound in blue velvet	45.894561767578125
Pardieu gentlemen said he	193.50965881347656
I hope what you have to tell me is worth the trouble or else I warn you I will not pardon you for making me come here instead of getting a little rest after a night spent in taking and dismantling a bastion	171.6124725341797
Ah why were you not there gentlemen It was warm work	1077.7066650390625
We were in a place where it was not very cold replied Porthos giving his mustache a twist which was peculiar to him	66.89422607421875
Hush said Athos	55.86613082885742
Oh oh said DArtagnan comprehending the slight frown of the Musketeer	277.8359680175781
It appears there is something fresh aboard	87.77106475830078
Aramis said Athos you went to breakfast the day before yesterday at the inn of the Parpaillot I believe	53.78199768066406
How did you fare	524.3739624023438
For my part I ate but little	1918.5477294921875
The day before yesterday was a fish day and they had nothing but meat	194.1146240234375
What said Athos no fish at a seaport	383.61749267578125
They say said Aramis resuming his pious reading that the dyke which the cardinal is making drives them all out into the open sea	109.51390838623047
But that is not quite what I mean to ask you Aramis replied Athos	139.66665649414062
I want to know if you were left alone and nobody interrupted you	130.2428741455078
Why I think there were not many intruders	97.97525024414062
Yes Athos I know what you mean we shall do very well at the Parpaillot	144.47952270507812
Let us go to the Parpaillot then for here the walls are like sheets of paper	35.16032791137695
DArtagnan who was accustomed to his friends manner of acting and who perceived immediately by a word a gesture or a sign from him that the circumstances were serious took Athoss arm and went out without saying anything	183.63687133789062
Porthos followed chatting with Aramis	61.064361572265625
On their way they met Grimaud	309.66802978515625
Athos made him a sign to come with them	140.25656127929688
Grimaud according to custom obeyed in silence the poor lad had nearly come to the pass of forgetting how to speak	262.1037292480469
They arrived at the drinking room of the Parpaillot	2745.177734375
It was seven oclock in the morning and daylight began to appear	703.5020141601562
The three friends ordered breakfast and went into a room in which the host said they would not be disturbed	1139.5902099609375
Unfortunately the hour was badly chosen for a private conference	188359.6875
The morning drum had just been beaten everyone shook off the drowsiness of night and to dispel the humid morning air came to take a drop at the inn	114.06226348876953
Dragoons Swiss Guardsmen Musketeers lighthorsemen succeeded one another with a rapidity which might answer the purpose of the host very well but agreed badly with the views of the four friends	795.2507934570312
Thus they applied very curtly to the salutations healths and jokes of their companions	259.81500244140625
I see how it will be said Athos we shall get into some pretty quarrel or other and we have no need of one just now	43.08268356323242
DArtagnan tell us what sort of a night you have had and we will describe ours afterward	59.255950927734375
Ah yes said a lighthorseman with a glass of brandy in his hand which he sipped slowly	21.0952205657959
I hear you gentlemen of the Guards have been in the trenches tonight and that you did not get much the best of the Rochellais	6.849388122558594
DArtagnan looked at Athos to know if he ought to reply to this intruder who thus mixed unasked in their conversation	317.1750183105469
Well said Athos do nt you hear Monsieur de Busigny who does you the honor to ask you a question Relate what has passed during the night since these gentlemen desire to know it	1186.298583984375
Have you not taken a bastion said a Swiss who was drinking rum out of a beer glass	29.437429428100586
Yes monsieur said DArtagnan bowing we have had that honor	2278.823974609375
We even have as you may have heard introduced a barrel of powder under one of the angles which in blowing up made a very pretty breach	365.4307556152344
Without reckoning that as the bastion was not built yesterday all the rest of the building was badly shaken	106.6101303100586
And what bastion is it asked a dragoon with his saber run through a goose which he was taking to be cooked	61.686851501464844
The bastion St	181.77545166015625
Gervais replied DArtagnan from behind which the Rochellais annoyed our workmen	30.90289306640625
Was that affair hot	43.6286735534668
Yes moderately so	40.58266830444336
We lost five men and the Rochellais eight or ten	79.599853515625
Balzempleu said the Swiss who notwithstanding the admirable collection of oaths possessed by the German language had acquired a habit of swearing in French	152.79135131835938
But it is probable said the lighthorseman that they will send pioneers this morning to repair the bastion	285.61029052734375
Yes that s probable said DArtagnan	83.75708770751953
Gentlemen said Athos a wager	220.5010986328125
Ah wooi a vager cried the Swiss	233.91104125976562
What is it said the lighthorseman	1.0454856157302856
Stop a bit said the dragoon placing his saber like a spit upon the two large iron dogs which held the firebrands in the chimney stop a bit I am in it	1433.6202392578125
You cursed host a dripping pan immediately that I may not lose a drop of the fat of this estimable bird	441.6549987792969
You was right said the Swiss goose grease is kood with basdry	1321.8204345703125
There said the dragoon	103.7171401977539
Now for the wager We listen Monsieur Athos	115.61659240722656
Yes the wager said the lighthorseman	228.5880584716797
Well Monsieur de Busigny I will bet you said Athos that my three companions Messieurs Porthos Aramis and DArtagnan and myself will go and breakfast in the bastion St	154.82986450195312
Gervais and we will remain there an hour by the watch whatever the enemy may do to dislodge us	148.5345001220703
Porthos and Aramis looked at each other they began to comprehend	53.08171844482422
But said DArtagnan in the ear of Athos you are going to get us all killed without mercy	317.86468505859375
We are much more likely to be killed said Athos if we do not go	57.91506576538086
My faith gentlemen said Porthos turning round upon his chair and twisting his mustache that s a fair bet I hope	186.36585998535156
I take it said M	280.2558898925781
de Busigny so let us fix the stake	35.302215576171875
You are four gentlemen said Athos and we are four an unlimited dinner for eight	73.55152130126953
Will that do	247.4287567138672
Capitally replied M	166.63807678222656
de Busigny	386.892578125
Perfectly said the dragoon	36.514705657958984
That shoots me said the Swiss	53.10828399658203
The fourth auditor who during all this conversation had played a mute part made a sign of the head in proof that he acquiesced in the proposition	43.03657913208008
The breakfast for these gentlemen is ready said the host	138.8701629638672
Well bring it said Athos	30.880996704101562
The host obeyed	86.57437133789062
Athos called Grimaud pointed to a large basket which lay in a corner and made a sign to him to wrap the viands up in the napkins	45.62285614013672
Grimaud understood that it was to be a breakfast on the grass took the basket packed up the viands added the bottles and then took the basket on his arm	139.77066040039062
But where are you going to eat my breakfast asked the host	101.98871612548828
What matter if you are paid for it said Athos and he threw two pistoles majestically on the table	126.64330291748047
Shall I give you the change my officer said the host	124.992919921875
No only add two bottles of champagne and the difference will be for the napkins	23.478811264038086
The host had not quite so good a bargain as he at first hoped for but he made amends by slipping in two bottles of Anjou wine instead of two bottles of champagne	155.94290161132812
Monsieur de Busigny said Athos will you be so kind as to set your watch with mine or permit me to regulate mine by yours	428.5370178222656
Which you please monsieur said the lighthorseman drawing from his fob a very handsome watch studded with diamonds half past seven	383.5115966796875
Thirtyfive minutes after seven said Athos by which you perceive I am five minutes faster than you	96.75040435791016
And bowing to all the astonished persons present the young men took the road to the bastion St	121.59454345703125
Gervais followed by Grimaud who carried the basket ignorant of where he was going but in the passive obedience which Athos had taught him not even thinking of asking	108.37531280517578
As long as they were within the circle of the camp the four friends did not exchange one word besides they were followed by the curious who hearing of the wager were anxious to know how they would come out of it	58.1029167175293
But when once they passed the line of circumvallation and found themselves in the open plain DArtagnan who was completely ignorant of what was going forward thought it was time to demand an explanation	1130.5325927734375
And now my dear Athos said he do me the kindness to tell me where we are going	205.28192138671875
Why you see plainly enough we are going to the bastion	106.58287811279297
But what are we going to do there	119.91632843017578
You know well that we go to breakfast there	446.6902160644531
But why did we not breakfast at the Parpaillot	428.24676513671875
Because we have very important matters to communicate to one another and it was impossible to talk five minutes in that inn without being annoyed by all those importunate fellows who keep coming in saluting you and addressing you	913.7899780273438
Here at least said Athos pointing to the bastion they will not come and disturb us	1949.6209716796875
It appears to me said DArtagnan with that prudence which allied itself in him so naturally with excessive bravery that we could have found some retired place on the downs or the seashore	53.65312194824219
Where we should have been seen all four conferring together so that at the end of a quarter of an hour the cardinal would have been informed by his spies that we were holding a council	121.25923919677734
Yes said Aramis Athos is right Animadvertuntur in desertis	234.11924743652344
A desert would not have been amiss said Porthos but it behooved us to find it	73.95073699951172
There is no desert where a bird can not pass over ones head where a fish can not leap out of the water where a rabbit can not come out of its burrow and I believe that bird fish and rabbit each becomes a spy of the cardinal	340.9200134277344
Better then pursue our enterprise from which besides we can not retreat without shame	978.4298706054688
We have made a wagera wager which could not have been foreseen and of which I defy anyone to divine the true cause	41.72454833984375
We are going in order to win it to remain an hour in the bastion	1140.1544189453125
Either we shall be attacked or not	404.0026550292969
If we are not we shall have all the time to talk and nobody will hear usfor I guarantee the walls of the bastion have no ears if we are we will talk of our affairs just the same	88.69091796875
Moreover in defending ourselves we shall cover ourselves with glory	71.07649993896484
You see that everything is to our advantage	316.87646484375
Yes said DArtagnan but we shall indubitably attract a ball	445.29278564453125
Well my dear replied Athos you know well that the balls most to be dreaded are not from the enemy	42.55659866333008
But for such an expedition we surely ought to have brought our muskets	84.34637451171875
You are stupid friend Porthos	196.248046875
Why should we load ourselves with a useless burden	54.27593994140625
I do nt find a good musket twelve cartridges and a powder flask very useless in the face of an enemy	154.31907653808594
Well replied Athos have you not heard what DArtagnan said	237.70846557617188
What did he say demanded Porthos	263.9170837402344
DArtagnan said that in the attack of last night eight or ten Frenchmen were killed and as many Rochellais	95.9315414428711
What then	54.2406120300293
The bodies were not plundered were they It appears the conquerors had something else to do	118.80268096923828
Well we shall find their muskets their cartridges and their flasks and instead of four musketoons and twelve balls we shall have fifteen guns and a hundred charges to fire	470.14288330078125
Oh Athos said Aramis truly you are a great man	2.000459671020508
Porthos nodded in sign of agreement	183.12017822265625
DArtagnan alone did not seem convinced	199.8450164794922
Grimaud no doubt shared the misgivings of the young man for seeing that they continued to advance toward the bastionsomething he had till then doubtedhe pulled his master by the skirt of his coat	46.81330871582031
Where are we going asked he by a gesture	1925.7398681640625
Athos pointed to the bastion	299.81695556640625
But said Grimaud in the same silent dialect we shall leave our skins there	128.78248596191406
Athos raised his eyes and his finger toward heaven	40.80528259277344
Grimaud put his basket on the ground and sat down with a shake of the head	91.91787719726562
Athos took a pistol from his belt looked to see if it was properly primed cocked it and placed the muzzle close to Grimauds ear	40.07621765136719
Grimaud was on his legs again as if by a spring	261.66455078125
Athos then made him a sign to take up his basket and to walk on first	66.48026275634766
Grimaud obeyed	256.9729309082031
All that Grimaud gained by this momentary pantomime was to pass from the rear guard to the vanguard	1894.732666015625
Arrived at the bastion the four friends turned round	26.49213409423828
More than three hundred soldiers of all kinds were assembled at the gate of the camp and in a separate group might be distinguished M	621.1940307617188
de Busigny the dragoon the Swiss and the fourth bettor	259.19134521484375
Athos took off his hat placed it on the end of his sword and waved it in the air	75.17147064208984
All the spectators returned him his salute accompanying this courtesy with a loud hurrah which was audible to the four after which all four disappeared in the bastion whither Grimaud had preceded them	1001.5028076171875
Chapter XLVII	126.47703552246094
THE COUNCIL OF THE MUSKETEERS	234.4186248779297
As Athos had foreseen the bastion was only occupied by a dozen corpses French and Rochellais	127.75859832763672
Gentlemen said Athos who had assumed the command of the expedition while Grimaud spreads the table let us begin by collecting the guns and cartridges together	44.486351013183594
We can talk while performing that necessary task	107.62954711914062
These gentlemen added he pointing to the bodies can not hear us	57.74266815185547
But we could throw them into the ditch said Porthos after having assured ourselves they have nothing in their pockets	161.1837921142578
Yes said Athos that s Grimauds business	574.0047607421875
Well then cried DArtagnan pray let Grimaud search them and throw them over the walls	38.527130126953125
Heaven forfend said Athos they may serve us	61.40813446044922
These bodies serve us said Porthos	57.86907958984375
You are mad dear friend	108.68437194824219
Judge not rashly say the gospel and the cardinal replied Athos	15.670161247253418
How many guns gentlemen	186.51858520507812
Twelve replied Aramis	23.19064712524414
How many shots	286.74932861328125
A hundred	141.89639282226562
That s quite as many as we shall want	15.288433074951172
Let us load the guns	188.03500366210938
The four Musketeers went to work and as they were loading the last musket Grimaud announced that the breakfast was ready	1033.1702880859375
Athos replied always by gestures that that was well and indicated to Grimaud by pointing to a turret that resembled a pepper caster that he was to stand as sentinel	92.01049041748047
Only to alleviate the tediousness of the duty Athos allowed him to take a loaf two cutlets and a bottle of wine	716.8046264648438
And now to table said Athos	710.4288330078125
The four friends seated themselves on the ground with their legs crossed like Turks or even tailors	162.59109497070312
And now said DArtagnan as there is no longer any fear of being overheard I hope you are going to let me into your secret	67.95394134521484
I hope at the same time to procure you amusement and glory gentlemen said Athos	41.04387283325195
I have induced you to take a charming promenade here is a delicious breakfast and yonder are five hundred persons as you may see through the loopholes taking us for heroes or madmentwo classes of imbeciles greatly resembling each other	160.9954376220703
But the secret said DArtagnan	248.23744201660156
The secret is said Athos that I saw Milady last night	64.33396911621094
DArtagnan was lifting a glass to his lips but at the name of Milady his hand trembled so that he was obliged to put the glass on the ground again for fear of spilling the contents	85.1197738647461
You saw your wi	300.57763671875
Hush interrupted Athos	109.73560333251953
You forget my dear you forget that these gentlemen are not initiated into my family affairs like yourself	114.7065658569336
I have seen Milady	108.3886947631836
Where demanded DArtagnan	9.521888732910156
Within two leagues of this place at the inn of the Red Dovecot	1835.6158447265625
In that case I am lost said DArtagnan	124.28419494628906
Not so bad yet replied Athos for by this time she must have quit the shores of France	126.45254516601562
DArtagnan breathed again	161.6712646484375
But after all asked Porthos who is Milady	56632.58203125
A charming woman said Athos sipping a glass of sparkling wine	9078.6591796875
Villainous host cried he he has given us Anjou wine instead of champagne and fancies we know no better Yes continued he a charming woman who entertained kind views toward our friend DArtagnan who on his part has given her some offense for which she tried to revenge herself a month ago by having him killed by two musket shots a week ago by trying to poison him and yesterday by demanding his head of the cardinal	76.23090362548828
What by demanding my head of the cardinal cried DArtagnan pale with terror	177.29583740234375
Yes that is true as the Gospel said Porthos I heard her with my own ears	48.234779357910156
I also said Aramis	110.3975830078125
Then said DArtagnan letting his arm fall with discouragement it is useless to struggle longer	111.0562515258789
I may as well blow my brains out and all will be over	113.27568817138672
That s the last folly to be committed said Athos seeing it is the only one for which there is no remedy	51.06657791137695
But I can never escape said DArtagnan with such enemies	69.6561050415039
First my stranger of Meung then De Wardes to whom I have given three sword wounds next Milady whose secret I have discovered finally the cardinal whose vengeance I have balked	206.68409729003906
Well said Athos that only makes four and we are fourone for one	92.5079116821289
Pardieu if we may believe the signs Grimaud is making we are about to have to do with a very different number of people	403.9602966308594
What is it Grimaud Considering the gravity of the occasion I permit you to speak my friend but be laconic I beg	349.642333984375
What do you see	48.94536590576172
A troop	62.87858963012695
Of how many persons	43.033512115478516
Twenty men	21.093751907348633
What sort of men	123.73591613769531
Sixteen pioneers four soldiers	35.410579681396484
How far distant	396.24786376953125
Five hundred paces	102.42724609375
Good We have just time to finish this fowl and to drink one glass of wine to your health DArtagnan	125.33717346191406
To your health repeated Porthos and Aramis	237.1199188232422
Well then to my health although I am very much afraid that your good wishes will not be of great service to me	71.2328109741211
Bah said Athos God is great as say the followers of Mohammed and the future is in his hands	43.40729522705078
Then swallowing the contents of his glass which he put down close to him Athos arose carelessly took the musket next to him and drew near to one of the loopholes	46.17359924316406
Porthos Aramis and DArtagnan followed his example	1717.570556640625
As to Grimaud he received orders to place himself behind the four friends in order to reload their weapons	423.14996337890625
Pardieu said Athos it was hardly worth while to distribute ourselves for twenty fellows armed with pickaxes mattocks and shovels	1402.0955810546875
Grimaud had only to make them a sign to go away and I am convinced they would have left us in peace	146.69898986816406
I doubt that replied DArtagnan for they are advancing very resolutely	490.6039733886719
Besides in addition to the pioneers there are four soldiers and a brigadier armed with muskets	168.81175231933594
That s because they do nt see us said Athos	94.4507064819336
My faith said Aramis I must confess I feel a great repugnance to fire on these poor devils of civilians	181.667236328125
He is a bad priest said Porthos who has pity for heretics	136.06993103027344
In truth said Athos Aramis is right	103.06695556640625
I will warn them	392.436767578125
What the devil are you going to do cried DArtagnan you will be shot	48.42558288574219
But Athos heeded not his advice	5629.4658203125
Mounting on the breach with his musket in one hand and his hat in the other he said bowing courteously and addressing the soldiers and the pioneers who astonished at this apparition stopped fifty paces from the bastion Gentlemen a few friends and myself are about to breakfast in this bastion	187.84115600585938
Now you know nothing is more disagreeable than being disturbed when one is at breakfast	100.63117980957031
We request you then if you really have business here to wait till we have finished our repast or to come again a short time hence unless which would be far better you form the salutary resolution to quit the side of the rebels and come and drink with us to the health of the King of France	132.62132263183594
Take care Athos cried DArtagnan do nt you see they are aiming	47.91085433959961
Yes yes said Athos but they are only civiliansvery bad marksmen who will be sure not to hit me	213.15020751953125
In fact at the same instant four shots were fired and the balls were flattened against the wall around Athos but not one touched him	569.9274291992188
Four shots replied to them almost instantaneously but much better aimed than those of the aggressors three soldiers fell dead and one of the pioneers was wounded	268.804443359375
Grimaud said Athos still on the breach another musket	461.2414245605469
Grimaud immediately obeyed	621.9459838867188
On their part the three friends had reloaded their arms a second discharge followed the first	724.97265625
The brigadier and two pioneers fell dead the rest of the troop took to flight	253.2088165283203
Now gentlemen a sortie cried Athos	231.5272216796875
And the four friends rushed out of the fort gained the field of battle picked up the four muskets of the privates and the halfpike of the brigadier and convinced that the fugitives would not stop till they reached the city turned again toward the bastion bearing with them the trophies of their victory	24.37394142150879
Reload the muskets Grimaud said Athos and we gentlemen will go on with our breakfast and resume our conversation	110.65371704101562
Where were we	365.52850341796875
I recollect you were saying said DArtagnan that after having demanded my head of the cardinal Milady had quit the shores of France	200.6313934326172
Whither goes she added he strongly interested in the route Milady followed	428.8538818359375
She goes into England said Athos	82.38340759277344
With what view	67.75860595703125
With the view of assassinating or causing to be assassinated the Duke of Buckingham	70.5478286743164
DArtagnan uttered an exclamation of surprise and indignation	108.28367614746094
But this is infamous cried he	45.87334060668945
As to that said Athos I beg you to believe that I care very little about it	59.2790412902832
Now you have done Grimaud take our brigadiers halfpike tie a napkin to it and plant it on top of our bastion that these rebels of Rochellais may see that they have to deal with brave and loyal soldiers of the king	26.581829071044922
Grimaud obeyed without replying	59.936946868896484
An instant afterward the white flag was floating over the heads of the four friends	149.76101684570312
A thunder of applause saluted its appearance half the camp was at the barrier	12.147361755371094
How replied DArtagnan you care little if she kills Buckingham or causes him to be killed But the duke is our friend	112.27937316894531
The duke is English the duke fights against us	366.172607421875
Let her do what she likes with the duke I care no more about him than an empty bottle	169.2085723876953
And Athos threw fifteen paces from him an empty bottle from which he had poured the last drop into his glass	72.82225036621094
A moment said DArtagnan	250.031494140625
I will not abandon Buckingham thus	42.29628372192383
He gave us some very fine horses	97.27571868896484
And moreover very handsome saddles said Porthos who at the moment wore on his cloak the lace of his own	155.68946838378906
Besides said Aramis God desires the conversion and not the death of a sinner	229.89585876464844
Amen said Athos and we will return to that subject later if such be your pleasure but what for the moment engaged my attention most earnestly and I am sure you will understand me DArtagnan was the getting from this woman a kind of carte blanche which she had extorted from the cardinal and by means of which she could with impunity get rid of you and perhaps of us	17.045074462890625
But this creature must be a demon said Porthos holding out his plate to Aramis who was cutting up a fowl	59.72708511352539
And this carte blanche said DArtagnan this carte blanche does it remain in her hands	50.75926971435547
No it passed into mine I will not say without trouble for if I did I should tell a lie	60.48402786254883
My dear Athos I shall no longer count the number of times I am indebted to you for my life	21.264245986938477
Then it was to go to her that you left us said Aramis	206.8700714111328
And you have that letter of the cardinal said DArtagnan	1514.5810546875
Here it is said Athos and he took the invaluable paper from the pocket of his uniform	393.174560546875
DArtagnan unfolded it with one hand whose trembling he did not even attempt to conceal to read	82.22160339355469
3 1627	21.12950897216797
It is by my order and for the good of the state that the bearer of this has done what he has done	28.903553009033203
In fact said Aramis it is an absolution according to rule	77.0582504272461
That paper must be torn to pieces said DArtagnan who fancied he read in it his sentence of death	740.7037353515625
On the contrary said Athos it must be preserved carefully	26.698755264282227
I would not give up this paper if covered with as many gold pieces	277.1111755371094
And what will she do now asked the young man	134.33340454101562
Why replied Athos carelessly she is probably going to write to the cardinal that a damned Musketeer named Athos has taken her safeconduct from her by force she will advise him in the same letter to get rid of his two friends Aramis and Porthos at the same time	197.87156677246094
The cardinal will remember that these are the same men who have often crossed his path and then some fine morning he will arrest DArtagnan and for fear he should feel lonely he will send us to keep him company in the Bastille	53.33346176147461
Go to It appears to me you make dull jokes my dear said Porthos	29.37633514404297
I do not jest said Athos	339.654541015625
Do you know said Porthos that to twist that damned Miladys neck would be a smaller sin than to twist those of these poor devils of Huguenots who have committed no other crime than singing in French the psalms we sing in Latin	281.143310546875
What says the abb asked Athos quietly	174.74798583984375
I say I am entirely of Porthoss opinion replied Aramis	613.7259521484375
And I too said DArtagnan	3.8801069259643555
Fortunately she is far off said Porthos for I confess she would worry me if she were here	76.3459701538086
She worries me in England as well as in France said Athos	343.4214172363281
She worries me everywhere said DArtagnan	731.290283203125
But when you held her in your power why did you not drown her strangle her hang her said Porthos	49.67084884643555
It is only the dead who do not return	331.08160400390625
You think so Porthos replied the Musketeer with a sad smile which DArtagnan alone understood	21.308368682861328
I have an idea said DArtagnan	328.0556640625
What is it said the Musketeers	3150.177001953125
To arms cried Grimaud	765.5798950195312
The young men sprang up and seized their muskets	55.02531814575195
This time a small troop advanced consisting of from twenty to twentyfive men but they were not pioneers they were soldiers of the garrison	268.7356262207031
Shall we return to the camp said Porthos	42.701175689697266
I do nt think the sides are equal	942.5845947265625
Impossible for three reasons replied Athos	126.9250717163086
The first that we have not finished breakfast the second that we still have some very important things to say and the third that it yet wants ten minutes before the lapse of the hour	54.209312438964844
Well then said Aramis we must form a plan of battle	234.8350372314453
That s very simple replied Athos	132.44790649414062
As soon as the enemy are within musket shot we must fire upon them	82.58399963378906
If they continue to advance we must fire again	72.01943969726562
We must fire as long as we have loaded guns	212.58392333984375
If those who remain of the troop persist in coming to the assault we will allow the besiegers to get as far as the ditch and then we will push down upon their heads that strip of wall which keeps its perpendicular by a miracle	558.947998046875
Bravo cried Porthos	113.43109130859375
Decidedly Athos you were born to be a general and the cardinal who fancies himself a great soldier is nothing beside you	18.50177574157715
Gentlemen said Athos no divided attention I beg let each one pick out his man	84.06049346923828
I cover mine said DArtagnan	254.33297729492188
And I mine said Porthos	384.09503173828125
And I idem said Aramis	44.92355728149414
Fire then said Athos	76.49737548828125
The four muskets made but one report but four men fell	35.86159133911133
The drum immediately beat and the little troop advanced at charging pace	20.346651077270508
Then the shots were repeated without regularity but always aimed with the same accuracy	94.13206481933594
Nevertheless as if they had been aware of the numerical weakness of the friends the Rochellais continued to advance in quick time	154.63302612304688
With every three shots at least two men fell but the march of those who remained was not slackened	79.93331146240234
Arrived at the foot of the bastion there were still more than a dozen of the enemy	199.5004425048828
A last discharge welcomed them but did not stop them they jumped into the ditch and prepared to scale the breach	1475.887451171875
Now my friends said Athos finish them at a blow	110.95092010498047
To the wall to the wall	33.14196014404297
And the four friends seconded by Grimaud pushed with the barrels of their muskets an enormous sheet of the wall which bent as if pushed by the wind and detaching itself from its base fell with a horrible crash into the ditch	107.83914947509766
Then a fearful crash was heard a cloud of dust mounted toward the skyand all was over	123.62133026123047
Can we have destroyed them all from the first to the last said Athos	164.68310546875
My faith it appears so said DArtagnan	119.84870147705078
No cried Porthos there go three or four limping away	46.93048095703125
In fact three or four of these unfortunate men covered with dirt and blood fled along the hollow way and at length regained the city	168.12692260742188
These were all who were left of the little troop	48.77434158325195
Athos looked at his watch	39.57436752319336
Gentlemen said he we have been here an hour and our wager is won but we will be fair players	42.286312103271484
Besides DArtagnan has not told us his idea yet	94.56412506103516
And the Musketeer with his usual coolness reseated himself before the remains of the breakfast	278.35406494140625
My idea said DArtagnan	149.3898468017578
Yes you said you had an idea said Athos	202.4661407470703
Oh I remember said DArtagnan	59.38725662231445
Well I will go to England a second time I will go and find Buckingham	77.33457946777344
You shall not do that DArtagnan said Athos coolly	99.00316619873047
And why not Have I not been there once	125.23794555664062
Yes but at that period we were not at war	100.50811767578125
At that period Buckingham was an ally and not an enemy	582.828369140625
What you would now do amounts to treason	243.9585418701172
DArtagnan perceived the force of this reasoning and was silent	106.29181671142578
But said Porthos I think I have an idea in my turn	197.73556518554688
Silence for Monsieur Porthoss idea said Aramis	114.72352600097656
I will ask leave of absence of Monsieur de Trville on some pretext or other which you must invent I am not very clever at pretexts	137.31910705566406
Milady does not know me I will get access to her without her suspecting me and when I catch my beauty I will strangle her	205.4246826171875
Well replied Athos I am not far from approving the idea of Monsieur Porthos	36.09328079223633
For shame said Aramis	221.44276428222656
Kill a woman No listen to me I have the true idea	222.38685607910156
Let us see your idea Aramis said Athos who felt much deference for the young Musketeer	176.39901733398438
We must inform the queen	229.6580810546875
Ah my faith yes said Porthos and DArtagnan at the same time we are coming nearer to it now	57.17072296142578
Inform the queen said Athos and how Have we relations with the court Could we send anyone to Paris without its being known in the camp From here to Paris it is a hundred and forty leagues before our letter was at Angers we should be in a dungeon	249.5674285888672
As to remitting a letter with safety to her Majesty said Aramis coloring I will take that upon myself	55.13189697265625
I know a clever person at Tours	54.22488784790039
Aramis stopped on seeing Athos smile	31.053791046142578
Well do you not adopt this means Athos said DArtagnan	4115.3740234375
I do not reject it altogether said Athos but I wish to remind Aramis that he can not quit the camp and that nobody but one of ourselves is trustworthy that two hours after the messenger has set out all the Capuchins all the police all the black caps of the cardinal will know your letter by heart and you and your clever person will be arrested	94.44908142089844
Without reckoning objected Porthos that the queen would save Monsieur de Buckingham but would take no heed of us	22.09657859802246
Gentlemen said DArtagnan what Porthos says is full of sense	19.702180862426758
Ah ah but what s going on in the city yonder said Athos	51.28583908081055
They are beating the general alarm	98.94780731201172
The four friends listened and the sound of the drum plainly reached them	51.847469329833984
You see they are going to send a whole regiment against us said Athos	33.86457061767578
You do nt think of holding out against a whole regiment do you said Porthos	431.07403564453125
Why not said the Musketeer	38.99810028076172
I feel myself quite in a humor for it and I would hold out before an army if we had taken the precaution to bring a dozen more bottles of wine	40.015377044677734
Upon my word the drum draws near said DArtagnan	87.0940933227539
Let it come said Athos	64.1441421508789
It is a quarter of an hours journey from here to the city consequently a quarter of an hours journey from the city to hither	37.14250946044922
That is more than time enough for us to devise a plan	8.023022651672363
If we go from this place we shall never find another so suitable	1122.1968994140625
Ah stop I have it gentlemen the right idea has just occurred to me	24.696928024291992
Tell us	27.18086051940918
Allow me to give Grimaud some indispensable orders	39.42704772949219
Athos made a sign for his lackey to approach	55.325748443603516
Grimaud said Athos pointing to the bodies which lay under the wall of the bastion take those gentlemen set them up against the wall put their hats upon their heads and their guns in their hands	106.56834411621094
Oh the great man cried DArtagnan	200.43240356445312
I comprehend now	73.5880355834961
You comprehend said Porthos	111.53679656982422
And do you comprehend Grimaud said Aramis	112.59693908691406
Grimaud made a sign in the affirmative	50.0046501159668
That s all that is necessary said Athos now for my idea	57.947635650634766
I should like however to comprehend said Porthos	53.994972229003906
That is useless	59.5751953125
Yes yes Athoss idea cried Aramis and DArtagnan at the same time	49.349464416503906
This Milady this woman this creature this demon has a brotherinlaw as I think you told me DArtagnan	27.1883487701416
Yes I know him very well and I also believe that he has not a very warm affection for his sisterinlaw	64.96784210205078
There is no harm in that	146.0607452392578
If he detested her it would be all the better replied Athos	179.0204315185547
In that case we are as well off as we wish	33.07917404174805
And yet said Porthos I would like to know what Grimaud is about	11.680948257446289
Silence Porthos said Aramis	81.24393463134766
What is her brotherinlaws name	1321.5609130859375
Lord de Winter	85.64264678955078
Where is he now	42.91459655761719
He returned to London at the first sound of war	929.2030029296875
Well there s just the man we want said Athos	100.29718017578125
It is he whom we must warn	73.98416900634766
We will have him informed that his sisterinlaw is on the point of having someone assassinated and beg him not to lose sight of her	2069.8896484375
There is in London I hope some establishment like that of the Magdalens or of the Repentant Daughters	89.86116027832031
He must place his sister in one of these and we shall be in peace	33.79838943481445
Yes said DArtagnan till she comes out	897.0925903320312
Ah my faith said Athos you require too much DArtagnan	424.7635803222656
I have given you all I have and I beg leave to tell you that this is the bottom of my sack	1238.5462646484375
But I think it would be still better said Aramis to inform the queen and Lord de Winter at the same time	188.1232452392578
Yes but who is to carry the letter to Tours and who to London	45.949073791503906
I answer for Bazin said Aramis	188.10450744628906
And I for Planchet said DArtagnan	57.52638244628906
Ay said Porthos if we can not leave the camp our lackeys may	817.4285278320312
To be sure they may and this very day we will write the letters said Aramis	96.75570678710938
Give the lackeys money and they will start	73.24971008300781
We will give them money replied Athos	33.25569152832031
Have you any money	645.8314819335938
The four friends looked at one another and a cloud came over the brows which but lately had been so cheerful	412.626953125
Look out cried DArtagnan I see black points and red points moving yonder	362.73895263671875
Why did you talk of a regiment Athos It is a veritable army	479.17193603515625
My faith yes said Athos there they are	227.07601928710938
See the sneaks come without drum or trumpet	361.2738037109375
Ah ah have you finished Grimaud	445.85626220703125
Grimaud made a sign in the affirmative and pointed to a dozen bodies which he had set up in the most picturesque attitudes	655.799560546875
Some carried arms others seemed to be taking aim and the remainder appeared merely to be sword in hand	511.9912109375
Bravo said Athos that does honor to your imagination	133.6055450439453
All very well said Porthos but I should like to understand	1173.707763671875
Let us decamp first and you will understand afterward	341.2051086425781
A moment gentlemen a moment give Grimaud time to clear away the breakfast	184.85101318359375
Ah ah said Aramis the black points and the red points are visibly enlarging	417.3172912597656
I am of DArtagnans opinion we have no time to lose in regaining our camp	198.4430389404297
My faith said Athos I have nothing to say against a retreat	354.8387756347656
We bet upon one hour and we have stayed an hour and a half	178.052734375
Nothing can be said let us be off gentlemen let us be off	467.00030517578125
Grimaud was already ahead with the basket and the dessert	118.7882308959961
The four friends followed ten paces behind him	69.4766845703125
What the devil shall we do now gentlemen cried Athos	70.0203857421875
Have you forgotten anything said Aramis	187.02203369140625
The white flag morbleu We must not leave a flag in the hands of the enemy even if that flag be but a napkin	155.96864318847656
And Athos ran back to the bastion mounted the platform and bore off the flag but as the Rochellais had arrived within musket range they opened a terrible fire upon this man who appeared to expose himself for pleasures sake	174.22174072265625
But Athos might be said to bear a charmed life	155.14173889160156
The balls passed and whistled all around him not one struck him	266.3046569824219
Athos waved his flag turning his back on the guards of the city and saluting those of the camp	31.317750930786133
On both sides loud cries aroseon the one side cries of anger on the other cries of enthusiasm	123.80060577392578
A second discharge followed the first and three balls by passing through it made the napkin really a flag	183.45359802246094
Cries were heard from the camp Come down come down	43133.7890625
Athos came down his friends who anxiously awaited him saw him returned with joy	115.29397583007812
Come along Athos come along cried DArtagnan now we have found everything except money it would be stupid to be killed	12.475369453430176
But Athos continued to march majestically whatever remarks his companions made and they finding their remarks useless regulated their pace by his	48.334354400634766
Grimaud and his basket were far in advance out of the range of the balls	345.1790771484375
At the end of an instant they heard a furious fusillade	442.87347412109375
What s that asked Porthos what are they firing at now I hear no balls whistle and I see nobody	36.03650665283203
They are firing at the corpses replied Athos	291.3529052734375
But the dead can not return their fire	45.668216705322266
Certainly not They will then fancy it is an ambuscade they will deliberate and by the time they have found out the pleasantry we shall be out of the range of their balls	68.3927230834961
That renders it useless to get a pleurisy by too much haste	120.21685028076172
Oh I comprehend now said the astonished Porthos	72.59062194824219
That s lucky said Athos shrugging his shoulders	284.7943115234375
On their part the French on seeing the four friends return at such a step uttered cries of enthusiasm	749.5678100585938
At length a fresh discharge was heard and this time the balls came rattling among the stones around the four friends and whistling sharply in their ears	6500.1474609375
The Rochellais had at last taken possession of the bastion	55.15895462036133
These Rochellais are bungling fellows said Athos how many have we killed of thema dozen	70.30754852294922
Or fifteen	98.8055648803711
How many did we crush under the wall	1671.477783203125
Eight or ten	235.88772583007812
And in exchange for all that not even a scratch Ah but what is the matter with your hand DArtagnan It bleeds seemingly	66.79000091552734
Oh its nothing said DArtagnan	82.85774993896484
A spent ball	193.63658142089844
Not even that	238.9352264404297
What is it then	171.02828979492188
We have said that Athos loved DArtagnan like a child and this somber and inflexible personage felt the anxiety of a parent for the young man	102.27507781982422
Only grazed a little replied DArtagnan my fingers were caught between two stonesthat of the wall and that of my ringand the skin was broken	93.0822982788086
That comes of wearing diamonds my master said Athos disdainfully	107.2838363647461
Ah to be sure cried Porthos there is a diamond	573.7623901367188
Why the devil then do we plague ourselves about money when there is a diamond	749.4755859375
Stop a bit said Aramis	78.11271667480469
Well thought of Porthos this time you have an idea	141.6701202392578
Undoubtedly said Porthos drawing himself up at Athoss compliment as there is a diamond let us sell it	450.11163330078125
But said DArtagnan it is the queens diamond	146.1745147705078
The stronger reason why it should be sold replied Athos	72.83350372314453
The queen saving Monsieur de Buckingham her lover nothing more just	68.77328491210938
The queen saving us her friends nothing more moral	487.781494140625
Let us sell the diamond	204.32418823242188
What says Monsieur the Abb I do nt ask Porthos his opinion has been given	120.41178894042969
Why I think said Aramis blushing as usual that his ring not coming from a mistress and consequently not being a love token DArtagnan may sell it	14848.8486328125
My dear Aramis you speak like theology personified	268.96099853515625
Your advice then is	8.184732437133789
To sell the diamond replied Aramis	368.6067810058594
Well then said DArtagnan gaily let us sell the diamond and say no more about it	32.67411804199219
The fusillade continued but the four friends were out of reach and the Rochellais only fired to appease their consciences	105.27180480957031
My faith it was time that idea came into Porthoss head	62.59684753417969
Here we are at the camp therefore gentlemen not a word more of this affair	116.24917602539062
We are observed they are coming to meet us	108.58822631835938
We shall be carried in triumph	44.93260192871094
In fact as we have said the whole camp was in motion	119.06394958496094
More than two thousand persons had assisted as at a spectacle in this fortunate but wild undertaking of the four friendsan undertaking of which they were far from suspecting the real motive	243.07302856445312
Nothing was heard but cries of Live the Musketeers Live the Guards M	79.74520111083984
de Busigny was the first to come and shake Athos by the hand and acknowledge that the wager was lost	25.91130828857422
The dragoon and the Swiss followed him and all their comrades followed the dragoon and the Swiss	122.78669738769531
There was nothing but felicitations pressures of the hand and embraces there was no end to the inextinguishable laughter at the Rochellais	86.86154174804688
The tumult at length became so great that the cardinal fancied there must be some riot and sent La Houdinire his captain of the Guards to inquire what was going on	943.178955078125
The affair was described to the messenger with all the effervescence of enthusiasm	89.22679138183594
Well asked the cardinal on seeing La Houdinire return	65.17042541503906
Well monseigneur replied the latter three Musketeers and a Guardsman laid a wager with Monsieur de Busigny that they would go and breakfast in the bastion St	70.86235809326172
Gervais and while breakfasting they held it for two hours against the enemy and have killed I do nt know how many Rochellais	1315.5889892578125
Did you inquire the names of those three Musketeers	65.62158203125
Yes monseigneur	601.2261352539062
What are their names	242.48817443847656
Messieurs Athos Porthos and Aramis	339.461181640625
Still my three brave fellows murmured the cardinal	800.7388916015625
And the Guardsman	327.09893798828125
Still my young scapegrace	313.26080322265625
Positively these four men must be on my side	121.762451171875
The same evening the cardinal spoke to M	2.000459671020508
de Trville of the exploit of the morning which was the talk of the whole camp	8476.1005859375
de Trville who had received the account of the adventure from the mouths of the heroes of it related it in all its details to his Eminence not forgetting the episode of the napkin	147.03543090820312
That s well Monsieur de Trville said the cardinal pray let that napkin be sent to me	283.7748107910156
I will have three fleurdelis embroidered on it in gold and will give it to your company as a standard	929.3687133789062
Monseigneur said M	169.46348571777344
de Trville that will be unjust to the Guardsmen	76.77696990966797
Monsieur dArtagnan is not with me he serves under Monsieur Dessessart	472.645751953125
Well then take him said the cardinal when four men are so much attached to one another it is only fair that they should serve in the same company	296.60687255859375
That same evening M	769.828857421875
de Trville announced this good news to the three Musketeers and DArtagnan inviting all four to breakfast with him next morning	88.13514709472656
DArtagnan was beside himself with joy	325.38494873046875
We know that the dream of his life had been to become a Musketeer	72.10238647460938
The three friends were likewise greatly delighted	81.67228698730469
My faith said DArtagnan to Athos you had a triumphant idea As you said we have acquired glory and were enabled to carry on a conversation of the highest importance	458.2798767089844
Which we can resume now without anybody suspecting us for with the help of God we shall henceforth pass for cardinalists	43.05413818359375
That evening DArtagnan went to present his respects to M	134.40945434570312
Dessessart and inform him of his promotion	380.8398742675781
Dessessart who esteemed DArtagnan made him offers of help as this change would entail expenses for equipment	164.68789672851562
DArtagnan refused but thinking the opportunity a good one he begged him to have the diamond he put into his hand valued as he wished to turn it into money	367.8754577636719
The next day M	128.57740783691406
Dessessarts valet came to DArtagnans lodging and gave him a bag containing seven thousand livres	768.7100830078125
This was the price of the queens diamond	479.40850830078125
Chapter XLVIII	101.34197235107422
A FAMILY AFFAIR	42.64927291870117
Athos had invented the phrase family affair	156.50503540039062
A family affair was not subject to the investigation of the cardinal a family affair concerned nobody	34.63650131225586
People might employ themselves in a family affair before all the world	34.63650131225586
Therefore Athos had invented the phrase family affair	34.63650131225586
Aramis had discovered the idea the lackeys	459.0308837890625
Porthos had discovered the means the diamond	113.9963607788086
DArtagnan alone had discovered nothinghe ordinarily the most inventive of the four but it must be also said that the very name of Milady paralyzed him	267.1615295410156
Ah no we were mistaken he had discovered a purchaser for his diamond	161.63743591308594
The breakfast at M	53.307884216308594
de Trvilles was as gay and cheerful as possible	103.51417541503906
DArtagnan already wore his uniformfor being nearly of the same size as Aramis and as Aramis was so liberally paid by the publisher who purchased his poem as to allow him to buy everything double he sold his friend a complete outfit	138.24171447753906
DArtagnan would have been at the height of his wishes if he had not constantly seen Milady like a dark cloud hovering in the horizon	517.2957763671875
After breakfast it was agreed that they should meet again in the evening at Athoss lodging and there finish their plans	21.39531898498535
DArtagnan passed the day in exhibiting his Musketeers uniform in every street of the camp	176.05465698242188
In the evening at the appointed hour the four friends met	209.0981903076172
There only remained three things to decidewhat they should write to Miladys brother what they should write to the clever person at Tours and which should be the lackeys to carry the letters	56.62987518310547
Everyone offered his own	125.6030502319336
Athos talked of the discretion of Grimaud who never spoke a word but when his master unlocked his mouth	998.7301025390625
Porthos boasted of the strength of Mousqueton who was big enough to thrash four men of ordinary size	150.53892517089844
Aramis confiding in the address of Bazin made a pompous eulogium on his candidate	550.845703125
Finally DArtagnan had entire faith in the bravery of Planchet and reminded them of the manner in which he had conducted himself in the ticklish affair of Boulogne	380.9219665527344
These four virtues disputed the prize for a length of time and gave birth to magnificent speeches which we do not repeat here for fear they should be deemed too long	183.26998901367188
Unfortunately said Athos he whom we send must possess in himself alone the four qualities united	59.985328674316406
But where is such a lackey to be found	362.9351501464844
Not to be found cried Athos	264.3840026855469
I know it well so take Grimaud	880.9960327148438
Take Mousqueton	262.2901611328125
Take Bazin	162.1222686767578
Take Planchet	125.13431549072266
Planchet is brave and shrewd they are two qualities out of the four	145.3463897705078
Gentlemen said Aramis the principal question is not to know which of our four lackeys is the most discreet the most strong the most clever or the most brave the principal thing is to know which loves money the best	360.0716247558594
What Aramis says is very sensible replied Athos we must speculate upon the faults of people and not upon their virtues	2981.6376953125
Monsieur Abb you are a great moralist	409.784423828125
Doubtless said Aramis for we not only require to be well served in order to succeed but moreover not to fail for in case of failure heads are in question not for our lackeys	123.01197052001953
Speak lower Aramis said Athos	196.98025512695312
That s wisenot for the lackeys resumed Aramis but for the masterfor the masters we may say	55.511444091796875
Are our lackeys sufficiently devoted to us to risk their lives for us No	207.21145629882812
My faith said DArtagnan	120.4312515258789
I would almost answer for Planchet	595.9320678710938
Well my dear friend add to his natural devotedness a good sum of money and then instead of answering for him once answer for him twice	243.45700073242188
Why good God you will be deceived just the same said Athos who was an optimist when things were concerned and a pessimist when men were in question	7929.4521484375
They will promise everything for the sake of the money and on the road fear will prevent them from acting	50.70808029174805
Once taken they will be pressed when pressed they will confess everything	637.646240234375
What the devil we are not children	70.7433090209961
To reach EnglandAthos lowered his voiceall France covered with spies and creatures of the cardinal must be crossed	111.85567474365234
A passport for embarkation must be obtained and the party must be acquainted with English in order to ask the way to London	654.8064575195312
Really I think the thing very difficult	817.260498046875
Not at all cried DArtagnan who was anxious the matter should be accomplished on the contrary I think it very easy	61.419464111328125
It would be no doubt parbleu if we write to Lord de Winter about affairs of vast importance of the horrors of the cardinal	61.038021087646484
Speak lower said Athos	368.98681640625
of intrigues and secrets of state continued DArtagnan complying with the recommendation	188.47520446777344
There can be no doubt we would all be broken on the wheel but for Gods sake do not forget as you yourself said Athos that we only write to him concerning a family affair that we only write to him to entreat that as soon as Milady arrives in London he will put it out of her power to injure us	142.84335327148438
I will write to him then nearly in these terms	168.6912078857422
Let us see said Athos assuming in advance a critical look	15.030118942260742
Monsieur and dear friend	520.460205078125
Ah yes Dear friend to an Englishman interrupted Athos well commenced Bravo DArtagnan Only with that word you would be quartered instead of being broken on the wheel	78.48772430419922
Well perhaps	32.19762420654297
I will say then Monsieur quite short	971.0133666992188
You may even say My Lord replied Athos who stickled for propriety	55.516422271728516
My Lord do you remember the little goat pasture of the Luxembourg	66.00224304199219
Good the Luxembourg One might believe this is an allusion to the queenmother That s ingenious said Athos	638.1253051757812
Well then we will put simply My Lord do you remember a certain little enclosure where your life was spared	4.710427284240723
My dear DArtagnan you will never make anything but a very bad secretary	257.2989501953125
Where your life was spared For shame that s unworthy	124.63386535644531
A man of spirit is not to be reminded of such services	236.031982421875
A benefit reproached is an offense committed	350.7631530761719
The devil said DArtagnan you are insupportable	324.1235046386719
If the letter must be written under your censure my faith I renounce the task	48.943599700927734
And you will do right	94.2458267211914
Handle the musket and the sword my dear fellow	294.15374755859375
You will come off splendidly at those two exercises but pass the pen over to Monsieur Abb	764.4960327148438
That s his province	11.57733154296875
Ay ay said Porthos pass the pen to Aramis who writes theses in Latin	65.00617980957031
Well so be it said DArtagnan	169.82855224609375
Draw up this note for us Aramis but by our Holy Father the Pope cut it short for I shall prune you in my turn I warn you	145.79806518554688
I ask no better said Aramis with that ingenious air of confidence which every poet has in himself but let me be properly acquainted with the subject	60.21731948852539
I have heard here and there that this sisterinlaw was a hussy	230.17269897460938
I have obtained proof of it by listening to her conversation with the cardinal	88.02703857421875
Lower sacr bleu said Athos	849.515869140625
But continued Aramis the details escape me	386.7477722167969
And me also said Porthos	255.49952697753906
DArtagnan and Athos looked at each other for some time in silence	144.04876708984375
At length Athos after serious reflection and becoming more pale than usual made a sign of assent to DArtagnan who by it understood he was at liberty to speak	116.27727508544922
Well this is what you have to say said DArtagnan My Lord your sisterinlaw is an infamous woman who wished to have you killed that she might inherit your wealth but she could not marry your brother being already married in France and having been DArtagnan stopped as if seeking for the word and looked at Athos	351.9857482910156
Repudiated by her husband said Athos	719.21875
Because she had been branded continued DArtagnan	456.63970947265625
Bah cried Porthos	109.56584167480469
Impossible What do you saythat she wanted to have her brotherinlaw killed	83.62256622314453
She was married asked Aramis	121.03948974609375
And her husband found out that she had a fleurdelis on her shoulder cried Porthos	306.7867431640625
These three yeses had been pronounced by Athos each with a sadder intonation	29.761430740356445
And who has seen this fleurdelis inquired Aramis	143.152099609375
DArtagnan and I	416.732666015625
Or rather to observe the chronological order I and DArtagnan replied Athos	395.7965393066406
And does the husband of this frightful creature still live said Aramis	34.10283660888672
He still lives	417.4689636230469
Are you quite sure of it	79.90979766845703
I am he	102.31106567382812
There was a moment of cold silence during which everyone was affected according to his nature	57.75484085083008
This time said Athos first breaking the silence DArtagnan has given us an excellent program and the letter must be written at once	81.22080993652344
The devil You are right Athos said Aramis and it is a rather difficult matter	186.1827850341797
The chancellor himself would be puzzled how to write such a letter and yet the chancellor draws up an official report very readily	32.084354400634766
Never mind Be silent I will write	145.84805297851562
Aramis accordingly took the quill reflected for a few moments wrote eight or ten lines in a charming little female hand and then with a voice soft and slow as if each word had been scrupulously weighed he read the following	35.909828186035156
My Lord The person who writes these few lines had the honor of crossing swords with you in the little enclosure of the Rue dEnfer	410.3448486328125
As you have several times since declared yourself the friend of that person he thinks it his duty to respond to that friendship by sending you important information	131.2753448486328
Twice you have nearly been the victim of a near relative whom you believe to be your heir because you are ignorant that before she contracted a marriage in England she was already married in France	536.3948974609375
But the third time which is the present you may succumb	9.04849624633789
Your relative left La Rochelle for England during the night	1467.1375732421875
Watch her arrival for she has great and terrible projects	133.37193298339844
If you require to know positively what she is capable of read her past history on her left shoulder	196.72344970703125
Well now that will do wonderfully well said Athos	190.3472137451172
My dear Aramis you have the pen of a secretary of state	93.63322448730469
Lord de Winter will now be upon his guard if the letter should reach him and even if it should fall into the hands of the cardinal we shall not be compromised	52.10066223144531
But as the lackey who goes may make us believe he has been to London and may stop at Chtellerault let us give him only half the sum promised him with the letter with an agreement that he shall have the other half in exchange for the reply	277.3113098144531
Have you the diamond continued Athos	478.1373291015625
I have what is still better	1608.778076171875
I have the price and DArtagnan threw the bag upon the table	439.892822265625
At the sound of the gold Aramis raised his eyes and Porthos started	213.88009643554688
As to Athos he remained unmoved	174.07806396484375
How much in that little bag	447.4986267089844
Seven thousand livres in louis of twelve francs	85.5090560913086
Seven thousand livres cried Porthos	98.47359466552734
That poor little diamond was worth seven thousand livres	85.17877197265625
It appears so said Athos since here they are	34.62610626220703
I do nt suppose that our friend DArtagnan has added any of his own to the amount	63.27500915527344
But gentlemen in all this said DArtagnan we do not think of the queen	15.245038986206055
Let us take some heed of the welfare of her dear Buckingham	29.703704833984375
That is the least we owe her	90.25123596191406
That s true said Athos but that concerns Aramis	75.219482421875
Well replied the latter blushing what must I say	1607.997314453125
Oh that s simple enough replied Athos	440.69378662109375
Write a second letter for that clever personage who lives at Tours	60.72382354736328
Aramis resumed his pen reflected a little and wrote the following lines which he immediately submitted to the approbation of his friends	124.1477279663086
My dear cousin	35.80721664428711
Ah ah said Athos	433.8453369140625
This clever person is your relative then	82.07177734375
Go on to your cousin then	205.22740173339844
Aramis continued	209.4145965576172
MY DEAR COUSIN His Eminence the cardinal whom God preserve for the happiness of France and the confusion of the enemies of the kingdom is on the point of putting an end to the hectic rebellion of La Rochelle	100.63626861572266
It is probable that the succor of the English fleet will never even arrive in sight of the place	164.62986755371094
I will even venture to say that I am certain M	220.5010986328125
de Buckingham will be prevented from setting out by some great event	52.74352264404297
His Eminence is the most illustrious politician of times past of times present and probably of times to come	22.7480411529541
He would extinguish the sun if the sun incommoded him	62.920284271240234
Give these happy tidings to your sister my dear cousin	123.07903289794922
I have dreamed that the unlucky Englishman was dead	840.1281127929688
I can not recollect whether it was by steel or by poison only of this I am sure I have dreamed he was dead and you know my dreams never deceive me	261.7149658203125
Be assured then of seeing me soon return	74.279541015625
Capital cried Athos you are the king of poets my dear Aramis	51.06572723388672
You speak like the Apocalypse and you are as true as the Gospel	50.22628402709961
There is nothing now to do but to put the address to this letter	89.08586120605469
That is easily done said Aramis	48.956966400146484
He folded the letter fancifully and took up his pen and wrote	197.38153076171875
To Mlle	131.11819458007812
Michon seamstress Tours	75.96724700927734
The three friends looked at one another and laughed they were caught	248.16038513183594
Now said Aramis you will please to understand gentlemen that Bazin alone can carry this letter to Tours	277.59136962890625
My cousin knows nobody but Bazin and places confidence in nobody but him any other person would fail	144.350830078125
Besides Bazin is ambitious and learned Bazin has read history gentlemen he knows that Sixtus the Fifth became Pope after having kept pigs	804.072265625
Well as he means to enter the Church at the same time as myself he does not despair of becoming Pope in his turn or at least a cardinal	664.79345703125
You can understand that a man who has such views will never allow himself to be taken or if taken will undergo martyrdom rather than speak	41.658119201660156
Very well said DArtagnan I consent to Bazin with all my heart but grant me Planchet	219.3815460205078
Milady had him one day turned out of doors with sundry blows of a good stick to accelerate his motions	41.658119201660156
Now Planchet has an excellent memory and I will be bound that sooner than relinquish any possible means of vengeance he will allow himself to be beaten to death	200.42359924316406
If your arrangements at Tours are your arrangements Aramis those of London are mine	221.8640594482422
I request then that Planchet may be chosen more particularly as he has already been to London with me and knows how to speak correctly London sir if you please and my master Lord DArtagnan	19.47797393798828
With that you may be satisfied he can make his way both going and returning	170.6935272216797
In that case said Athos Planchet must receive seven hundred livres for going and seven hundred livres for coming back and Bazin three hundred livres for going and three hundred livres for returningthat will reduce the sum to five thousand livres	80.64987182617188
We will each take a thousand livres to be employed as seems good and we will leave a fund of a thousand livres under the guardianship of Monsieur Abb here for extraordinary occasions or common wants	33.67375946044922
Will that do	122.76837921142578
My dear Athos said Aramis you speak like Nestor who was as everyone knows the wisest among the Greeks	67.1114501953125
Well then said Athos it is agreed	19.67756462097168
Planchet and Bazin shall go	39.678707122802734
Everything considered I am not sorry to retain Grimaud he is accustomed to my ways and I am particular	74.90869140625
Yesterdays affair must have shaken him a little his voyage would upset him quite	116.27312469482422
Planchet was sent for and instructions were given him	51.000160217285156
The matter had been named to him by DArtagnan who in the first place pointed out the money to him then the glory and then the danger	210.729736328125
I will carry the letter in the lining of my coat said Planchet and if I am taken I will swallow it	107.52269744873047
Well but then you will not be able to fulfill your commission said DArtagnan	417.8455505371094
You will give me a copy this evening which I shall know by heart tomorrow	412.26861572265625
DArtagnan looked at his friends as if to say Well what did I tell you	160.78561401367188
Now continued he addressing Planchet you have eight days to get an interview with Lord de Winter you have eight days to returnin all sixteen days	136.79171752929688
If on the sixteenth day after your departure at eight oclock in the evening you are not here no moneyeven if it be but five minutes past eight	64.3296127319336
Then monsieur said Planchet you must buy me a watch	216.68116760253906
Take this said Athos with his usual careless generosity giving him his own and be a good lad	115.80467987060547
Remember if you talk if you babble if you get drunk you risk your masters head who has so much confidence in your fidelity and who answers for you	169.77996826171875
But remember also that if by your fault any evil happens to DArtagnan I will find you wherever you may be for the purpose of ripping up your belly	26.9305419921875
Oh monsieur said Planchet humiliated by the suspicion and moreover terrified at the calm air of the Musketeer	127.63925170898438
And I said Porthos rolling his large eyes remember I will skin you alive	146.3513946533203
Ah monsieur	45.87013626098633
And I said Aramis with his soft melodius voice remember that I will roast you at a slow fire like a savage	90.6869888305664
Ah monsieur	163.17929077148438
Planchet began to weep	365.85845947265625
We will not venture to say whether it was from terror created by the threats or from tenderness at seeing four friends so closely united	115.05776977539062
DArtagnan took his hand	21.742345809936523
See Planchet said he these gentlemen only say this out of affection for me but at bottom they all like you	235.53616333007812
Ah monsieur said Planchet I will succeed or I will consent to be cut in quarters and if they do cut me in quarters be assured that not a morsel of me will speak	50.11676025390625
It was decided that Planchet should set out the next day at eight oclock in the morning in order as he had said that he might during the night learn the letter by heart	71.14757537841797
He gained just twelve hours by this engagement he was to be back on the sixteenth day by eight oclock in the evening	155.41909790039062
In the morning as he was mounting his horse DArtagnan who felt at the bottom of his heart a partiality for the duke took Planchet aside	53.369075775146484
Listen said he to him	280.20965576171875
When you have given the letter to Lord de Winter and he has read it you will further say to him Watch over his Grace Lord Buckingham for they wish to assassinate him	21.742345809936523
But this Planchet is so serious and important that I have not informed my friends that I would entrust this secret to you and for a captains commission I would not write it	383.2680969238281
Be satisfied monsieur said Planchet you shall see if confidence can be placed in me	149.54066467285156
Mounted on an excellent horse which he was to leave at the end of twenty leagues in order to take the post Planchet set off at a gallop his spirits a little depressed by the triple promise made him by the Musketeers but otherwise as lighthearted as possible	30.637069702148438
Bazin set out the next day for Tours and was allowed eight days for performing his commission	118.80437469482422
The four friends during the period of these two absences had as may well be supposed the eye on the watch the nose to the wind and the ear on the hark	242.7105255126953
Their days were passed in endeavoring to catch all that was said in observing the proceeding of the cardinal and in looking out for all the couriers who arrived	1475.6566162109375
More than once an involuntary trembling seized them when called upon for some unexpected service	459.471923828125
They had besides to look constantly to their own proper safety Milady was a phantom which when it had once appeared to people did not allow them to sleep very quietly	150.49098205566406
On the morning of the eighth day Bazin fresh as ever and smiling according to custom entered the cabaret of the Parpaillot as the four friends were sitting down to breakfast saying as had been agreed upon Monsieur Aramis the answer from your cousin	107.24849700927734
The four friends exchanged a joyful glance half of the work was done	171.06451416015625
It is true however that it was the shorter and easier part	160.22897338867188
Aramis blushing in spite of himself took the letter which was in a large coarse hand and not particular for its orthography	155.68576049804688
Good God cried he laughing I quite despair of my poor Michon she will never write like Monsieur de Voiture	122.62093353271484
What does you mean by boor Michon said the Swiss who was chatting with the four friends when the letter came	695.0421142578125
Oh pardieu less than nothing said Aramis a charming little seamstress whom I love dearly and from whose hand I requested a few lines as a sort of keepsake	174.27908325195312
The duvil said the Swiss if she is as great a lady as her writing is large you are a lucky fellow gomrade	77.4145278930664
Aramis read the letter and passed it to Athos	22.14266586303711
See what she writes to me Athos said he	54.088897705078125
Athos cast a glance over the epistle and to disperse all the suspicions that might have been created read aloud	89.6198501586914
MY COUSIN My sister and I are skillful in interpreting dreams and even entertain great fear of them but of yours it may be said I hope every dream is an illusion	1719.194580078125
Adieu Take care of yourself and act so that we may from time to time hear you spoken of	171.6552734375
MARIE MICHON	273.57952880859375
And what dream does she mean asked the dragoon who had approached during the reading	47.97788619995117
Yez what s the dream said the Swiss	81.50499725341797
Well pardieu said Aramis it was only this I had a dream and I related it to her	180.5015411376953
Yez yez said the Swiss its simple enough to dell a dream but I neffer dream	124.5035400390625
You are very fortunate said Athos rising I wish I could say as much	198.45553588867188
Neffer replied the Swiss enchanted that a man like Athos could envy him anything	1394.741943359375
Neffer neffer	359.1194763183594
DArtagnan seeing Athos rise did likewise took his arm and went out	117.4062728881836
Porthos and Aramis remained behind to encounter the jokes of the dragoon and the Swiss	619.4583129882812
As to Bazin he went and lay down on a truss of straw and as he had more imagination than the Swiss he dreamed that Aramis having become pope adorned his head with a cardinals hat	147.07974243164062
But as we have said Bazin had not by his fortunate return removed more than a part of the uneasiness which weighed upon the four friends	576.1387939453125
The days of expectation are long and DArtagnan in particular would have wagered that the days were fortyfour hours	25.193544387817383
He forgot the necessary slowness of navigation he exaggerated to himself the power of Milady	88.6920166015625
He credited this woman who appeared to him the equal of a demon with agents as supernatural as herself at the least noise he imagined himself about to be arrested and that Planchet was being brought back to be confronted with himself and his friends	47.687557220458984
Still further his confidence in the worthy Picard at one time so great diminished day by day	78.2486343383789
This anxiety became so great that it even extended to Aramis and Porthos	25.680362701416016
Athos alone remained unmoved as if no danger hovered over him and as if he breathed his customary atmosphere	186.0792999267578
On the sixteenth day in particular these signs were so strong in DArtagnan and his two friends that they could not remain quiet in one place and wandered about like ghosts on the road by which Planchet was expected	484.3020324707031
Really said Athos to them you are not men but children to let a woman terrify you so And what does it amount to after all To be imprisoned	70.23932647705078
Well but we should be taken out of prison Madame Bonacieux was released	77.23021697998047
To be decapitated Why every day in the trenches we go cheerfully to expose ourselves to worse than thatfor a bullet may break a leg and I am convinced a surgeon would give us more pain in cutting off a thigh than an executioner in cutting off a head	25.73627471923828
Wait quietly then in two hours in four in six hours at latest Planchet will be here	43.81663513183594
He promised to be here and I have very great faith in Planchet who appears to me to be a very good lad	66.54103088378906
But if he does not come said DArtagnan	29.492414474487305
Well if he does not come it will be because he has been delayed that s all	56.50838088989258
He may have fallen from his horse he may have cut a caper from the deck he may have traveled so fast against the wind as to have brought on a violent catarrh	92.73301696777344
Eh gentlemen let us reckon upon accidents Life is a chaplet of little miseries which the philosopher counts with a smile	85.89871978759766
Be philosophers as I am gentlemen sit down at the table and let us drink	48.53019332885742
Nothing makes the future look so bright as surveying it through a glass of chambertin	163.9390869140625
That s all very well replied DArtagnan but I am tired of fearing when I open a fresh bottle that the wine may come from the cellar of Milady	75.09830474853516
You are very fastidious said Athos such a beautiful woman	61.57817077636719
A woman of mark said Porthos with his loud laugh	116.82564544677734
Athos started passed his hand over his brow to remove the drops of perspiration that burst forth and rose in his turn with a nervous movement he could not repress	79.47935485839844
The day however passed away and the evening came on slowly but finally it came	572.1133422851562
The bars were filled with drinkers	64.734375
Athos who had pocketed his share of the diamond seldom quit the Parpaillot	308.62139892578125
He had found in M	99.4233627319336
de Busigny who by the by had given them a magnificent dinner a partner worthy of his company	66.21748352050781
They were playing together as usual when seven oclock sounded the patrol was heard passing to double the posts	271.9805603027344
At half past seven the retreat was sounded	42.37555694580078
We are lost said DArtagnan in the ear of Athos	48.54730987548828
You mean to say we have lost said Athos quietly drawing four pistoles from his pocket and throwing them upon the table	158.623291015625
Come gentlemen said he they are beating the tattoo	95.94856262207031
Let us to bed	67.70893096923828
And Athos went out of the Parpaillot followed by DArtagnan	67.70893096923828
Aramis came behind giving his arm to Porthos	67.70893096923828
Aramis mumbled verses to himself and Porthos from time to time pulled a hair or two from his mustache in sign of despair	54.802249908447266
But all at once a shadow appeared in the darkness the outline of which was familiar to DArtagnan and a wellknown voice said Monsieur I have brought your cloak it is chilly this evening	2.000459671020508
Planchet cried DArtagnan beside himself with joy	365.4020080566406
Planchet repeated Aramis and Porthos	337.82659912109375
Well yes Planchet to be sure said Athos what is there so astonishing in that He promised to be back by eight oclock and eight is striking	947.631103515625
Bravo Planchet you are a lad of your word and if ever you leave your master I will promise you a place in my service	157.65626525878906
Oh no never said Planchet I will never leave Monsieur dArtagnan	99.63594055175781
At the same time DArtagnan felt that Planchet slipped a note into his hand	332.79400634765625
DArtagnan felt a strong inclination to embrace Planchet as he had embraced him on his departure but he feared lest this mark of affection bestowed upon his lackey in the open street might appear extraordinary to passersby and he restrained himself	336.45416259765625
I have the note said he to Athos and to his friends	156.497802734375
That s well said Athos let us go home and read it	221.13002014160156
The note burned the hand of DArtagnan	412.466796875
He wished to hasten their steps but Athos took his arm and passed it under his own and the young man was forced to regulate his pace by that of his friend	121.26397705078125
At length they reached the tent lit a lamp and while Planchet stood at the entrance that the four friends might not be surprised DArtagnan with a trembling hand broke the seal and opened the so anxiously expected letter	2282.703369140625
It contained half a line in a hand perfectly British and with a conciseness as perfectly Spartan	374.1448669433594
Thank you be easy	228.71310424804688
DArtagnan translated this for the others	1354.2425537109375
Athos took the letter from the hands of DArtagnan approached the lamp set fire to the paper and did not let go till it was reduced to a cinder	211.1566162109375
Then calling Planchet he said Now my lad you may claim your seven hundred livres but you did not run much risk with such a note as that	82.61444854736328
I am not to blame for having tried every means to compress it said Planchet	1955.71044921875
Well cried DArtagnan tell us all about it	189.42420959472656
Dame that s a long job monsieur	637.552001953125
You are right Planchet said Athos besides the tattoo has been sounded and we should be observed if we kept a light burning much longer than the others	331.0583801269531
So be it said DArtagnan	114.27528381347656
Go to bed Planchet and sleep soundly	48.186073303222656
My faith monsieur that will be the first time I have done so for sixteen days	188.95140075683594
And me too said DArtagnan	553.5659790039062
And me too said Porthos	65.72624206542969
And me too said Aramis	152.81787109375
Well if you will have the truth and me too said Athos	120.59583282470703
Chapter XLIX	728.4375610351562
Meantime Milady drunk with passion roaring on the deck like a lioness that has been embarked had been tempted to throw herself into the sea that she might regain the coast for she could not get rid of the thought that she had been insulted by DArtagnan threatened by Athos and that she had quit France without being revenged on them	452.7832946777344
This idea soon became so insupportable to her that at the risk of whatever terrible consequences might result to herself from it she implored the captain to put her on shore but the captain eager to escape from his false positionplaced between French and English cruisers like the bat between the mice and the birdswas in great haste to regain England and positively refused to obey what he took for a womans caprice promising his passenger who had been particularly recommended to him by the cardinal to land her if the sea and the French permitted him at one of the ports of Brittany either at Lorient or Brest	1064.9951171875
But the wind was contrary the sea bad they tacked and kept offshore	522.6298828125
Nine days after leaving the Charente pale with fatigue and vexation Milady saw only the blue coasts of Finisterre appear	183.1568603515625
She calculated that to cross this corner of France and return to the cardinal it would take her at least three days	221.69273376464844
Add another day for landing and that would make four	54.18531799316406
Add these four to the nine others that would be thirteen days lostthirteen days during which so many important events might pass in London	251.08108520507812
She reflected likewise that the cardinal would be furious at her return and consequently would be more disposed to listen to the complaints brought against her than to the accusations she brought against others	95.9355239868164
She allowed the vessel to pass Lorient and Brest without repeating her request to the captain who on his part took care not to remind her of it	239.44105529785156
Milady therefore continued her voyage and on the very day that Planchet embarked at Portsmouth for France the messenger of his Eminence entered the port in triumph	320.5768737792969
All the city was agitated by an extraordinary movement	98.122802734375
Four large vessels recently built had just been launched	179.81504821777344
At the end of the jetty his clothes richly laced with gold glittering as was customary with him with diamonds and precious stones his hat ornamented with a white feather which drooped upon his shoulder Buckingham was seen surrounded by a staff almost as brilliant as himself	82.28541564941406
It was one of those rare and beautiful days in winter when England remembers that there is a sun	328.1357727050781
The star of day pale but nevertheless still splendid was setting in the horizon glorifying at once the heavens and the sea with bands of fire and casting upon the towers and the old houses of the city a last ray of gold which made the windows sparkle like the reflection of a conflagration	47.676212310791016
Breathing that sea breeze so much more invigorating and balsamic as the land is approached contemplating all the power of those preparations she was commissioned to destroy all the power of that army which she was to combat aloneshe a woman with a few bags of goldMilady compared herself mentally to Judith the terrible Jewess when she penetrated the camp of the Assyrians and beheld the enormous mass of chariots horses men and arms which a gesture of her hand was to dissipate like a cloud of smoke	47.86539077758789
They entered the roadstead but as they drew near in order to cast anchor a little cutter looking like a coastguard formidably armed approached the merchant vessel and dropped into the sea a boat which directed its course to the ladder	239.12066650390625
This boat contained an officer a mate and eight rowers	147.94766235351562
The officer alone went on board where he was received with all the deference inspired by the uniform	39.68819808959961
The officer conversed a few instants with the captain gave him several papers of which he was the bearer to read and upon the order of the merchant captain the whole crew of the vessel both passengers and sailors were called upon deck	480.945556640625
When this species of summons was made the officer inquired aloud the point of the brigs departure its route its landings and to all these questions the captain replied without difficulty and without hesitation	96.9948501586914
Then the officer began to pass in review all the people one after the other and stopping when he came to Milady surveyed her very closely but without addressing a single word to her	89.80037689208984
He then returned to the captain said a few words to him and as if from that moment the vessel was under his command he ordered a maneuver which the crew executed immediately	155.7294921875
Then the vessel resumed its course still escorted by the little cutter which sailed side by side with it menacing it with the mouths of its six cannon	106.86934661865234
The boat followed in the wake of the ship a speck near the enormous mass	15.256769180297852
During the examination of Milady by the officer as may well be imagined Milady on her part was not less scrutinizing in her glances	526.5016479492188
But however great was the power of this woman with eyes of flame in reading the hearts of those whose secrets she wished to divine she met this time with a countenance of such impassivity that no discovery followed her investigation	25.862424850463867
The officer who had stopped in front of her and studied her with so much care might have been twentyfive or twentysix years of age	100.90727996826172
He was of pale complexion with clear blue eyes rather deeply set his mouth fine and well cut remained motionless in its correct lines his chin strongly marked denoted that strength of will which in the ordinary Britannic type denotes mostly nothing but obstinacy a brow a little receding as is proper for poets enthusiasts and soldiers was scarcely shaded by short thin hair which like the beard which covered the lower part of his face was of a beautiful deep chestnut color	213.9608917236328
When they entered the port it was already night	1411.3206787109375
The fog increased the darkness and formed round the sternlights and lanterns of the jetty a circle like that which surrounds the moon when the weather threatens to become rainy	2603.872802734375
The air they breathed was heavy damp and cold	26.538496017456055
Milady that woman so courageous and firm shivered in spite of herself	197.4691925048828
The officer desired to have Miladys packages pointed out to him and ordered them to be placed in the boat	138.94110107421875
When this operation was complete he invited her to descend by offering her his hand	61.384300231933594
Milady looked at this man and hesitated	1418.711669921875
Who are you sir asked she who has the kindness to trouble yourself so particularly on my account	85.686767578125
You may perceive madame by my uniform that I am an officer in the English navy replied the young man	640.3098754882812
But is it the custom for the officers in the English navy to place themselves at the service of their female compatriots when they land in a port of Great Britain and carry their gallantry so far as to conduct them ashore	30.413040161132812
Yes madame it is the custom not from gallantry but prudence that in time of war foreigners should be conducted to particular htels in order that they may remain under the eye of the government until full information can be obtained about them	31.32341957092285
These words were pronounced with the most exact politeness and the most perfect calmness	932.71484375
Nevertheless they had not the power of convincing Milady	133.85519409179688
But I am not a foreigner sir said she with an accent as pure as ever was heard between Portsmouth and Manchester my name is Lady Clarik and this measure	29.92759895324707
This measure is general madame and you will seek in vain to evade it	48.97926330566406
I will follow you then sir	135.2112579345703
Accepting the hand of the officer she began the descent of the ladder at the foot of which the boat waited	20027.859375
The officer followed her	205.831787109375
A large cloak was spread at the stern the officer requested her to sit down upon this cloak and placed himself beside her	387.0876159667969
Row said he to the sailors	164.03761291503906
The eight oars fell at once into the sea making but a single sound giving but a single stroke and the boat seemed to fly over the surface of the water	21.60934066772461
In five minutes they gained the land	21.186809539794922
The officer leaped to the pier and offered his hand to Milady	64.13558197021484
A carriage was in waiting	43.55154037475586
Is this carriage for us asked Milady	228.31529235839844
Yes madame replied the officer	101.55743408203125
The htel then is far away	456.72442626953125
At the other end of the town	311.31524658203125
Very well said Milady and she resolutely entered the carriage	26.09932518005371
The officer saw that the baggage was fastened carefully behind the carriage and this operation ended he took his place beside Milady and shut the door	54.55671691894531
Immediately without any order being given or his place of destination indicated the coachman set off at a rapid pace and plunged into the streets of the city	295.7362365722656
So strange a reception naturally gave Milady ample matter for reflection so seeing that the young officer did not seem at all disposed for conversation she reclined in her corner of the carriage and one after the other passed in review all the surmises which presented themselves to her mind	368.70050048828125
At the end of a quarter of an hour however surprised at the length of the journey she leaned forward toward the door to see whither she was being conducted	1293.71435546875
Houses were no longer to be seen trees appeared in the darkness like great black phantoms chasing one another	206.956787109375
Milady shuddered	97.68537139892578
But we are no longer in the city sir said she	101.66693878173828
The young officer preserved silence	424.57586669921875
I beg you to understand sir I will go no farther unless you tell me whither you are taking me	309.0543518066406
This threat brought no reply	97.46440887451172
Oh this is too much cried Milady	404.0910949707031
Help help	150.3374786376953
No voice replied to hers the carriage continued to roll on with rapidity the officer seemed a statue	664.1525268554688
Milady looked at the officer with one of those terrible expressions peculiar to her countenance and which so rarely failed of their effect anger made her eyes flash in the darkness	192.73428344726562
The young man remained immovable	152.48753356933594
Milady tried to open the door in order to throw herself out	282.803955078125
Take care madame said the young man coolly you will kill yourself in jumping	172.06494140625
Milady reseated herself foaming	98.83271026611328
The officer leaned forward looked at her in his turn and appeared surprised to see that face just before so beautiful distorted with passion and almost hideous	66.56470489501953
The artful creature at once comprehended that she was injuring herself by allowing him thus to read her soul she collected her features and in a complaining voice said In the name of heaven sir tell me if it is to you if it is to your government if it is to an enemy I am to attribute the violence that is done me	274.1551513671875
No violence will be offered to you madame and what happens to you is the result of a very simple measure which we are obliged to adopt with all who land in England	409.5972595214844
Then you do nt know me sir	28.87733268737793
It is the first time I have had the honor of seeing you	172.84213256835938
And on your honor you have no cause of hatred against me	188.6954345703125
None I swear to you	98.12084197998047
There was so much serenity coolness mildness even in the voice of the young man that Milady felt reassured	18.775117874145508
At length after a journey of nearly an hour the carriage stopped before an iron gate which closed an avenue leading to a castle severe in form massive and isolated	132.19955444335938
Then as the wheels rolled over a fine gravel Milady could hear a vast roaring which she at once recognized as the noise of the sea dashing against some steep cliff	490.23638916015625
The carriage passed under two arched gateways and at length stopped in a court large dark and square	148.63674926757812
Almost immediately the door of the carriage was opened the young man sprang lightly out and presented his hand to Milady who leaned upon it and in her turn alighted with tolerable calmness	84.71845245361328
Still then I am a prisoner said Milady looking around her and bringing back her eyes with a most gracious smile to the young officer but I feel assured it will not be for long added she	1790.575927734375
My own conscience and your politeness sir are the guarantees of that	587.19287109375
However flattering this compliment the officer made no reply but drawing from his belt a little silver whistle such as boatswains use in ships of war he whistled three times with three different modulations	1747.551513671875
Immediately several men appeared who unharnessed the smoking horses and put the carriage into a coach house	5498.64013671875
Then the officer with the same calm politeness invited his prisoner to enter the house	1623.8392333984375
She with a stillsmiling countenance took his arm and passed with him under a low arched door which by a vaulted passage lighted only at the farther end led to a stone staircase around an angle of stone	176.5025177001953
They then came to a massive door which after the introduction into the lock of a key which the young man carried with him turned heavily upon its hinges and disclosed the chamber destined for Milady	129.92930603027344
With a single glance the prisoner took in the apartment in its minutest details	253.2041015625
It was a chamber whose furniture was at once appropriate for a prisoner or a free man and yet bars at the windows and outside bolts at the door decided the question in favor of the prison	390.2359924316406
In an instant all the strength of mind of this creature though drawn from the most vigorous sources abandoned her she sank into a large easy chair with her arms crossed her head lowered and expecting every instant to see a judge enter to interrogate her	29.328460693359375
But no one entered except two or three marines who brought her trunks and packages deposited them in a corner and retired without speaking	129.67782592773438
The officer superintended all these details with the same calmness Milady had constantly seen in him never pronouncing a word himself and making himself obeyed by a gesture of his hand or a sound of his whistle	2.000459671020508
It might have been said that between this man and his inferiors spoken language did not exist or had become useless	2445.863525390625
At length Milady could hold out no longer she broke the silence	201.30516052246094
In the name of heaven sir cried she what means all that is passing Put an end to my doubts I have courage enough for any danger I can foresee for every misfortune which I understand	310.7918395996094
Where am I and why am I here If I am free why these bars and these doors If I am a prisoner what crime have I committed	370.57745361328125
You are here in the apartment destined for you madame	105.01175689697266
I received orders to go and take charge of you on the sea and to conduct you to this castle	924.2312622070312
This order I believe I have accomplished with all the exactness of a soldier but also with the courtesy of a gentleman	158.7797088623047
There terminates at least to the present moment the duty I had to fulfill toward you the rest concerns another person	1108.4599609375
And who is that other person asked Milady warmly	87.28829193115234
Can you not tell me his name	179.18971252441406
At the moment a great jingling of spurs was heard on the stairs	447.80047607421875
Some voices passed and faded away and the sound of a single footstep approached the door	43.9864616394043
That person is here madame said the officer leaving the entrance open and drawing himself up in an attitude of respect	271.74346923828125
At the same time the door opened a man appeared on the threshold	180.1052703857422
He was without a hat carried a sword and flourished a handkerchief in his hand	109.58611297607422
Milady thought she recognized this shadow in the gloom she supported herself with one hand upon the arm of the chair and advanced her head as if to meet a certainty	36.90845489501953
The stranger advanced slowly and as he advanced after entering into the circle of light projected by the lamp Milady involuntarily drew back	139.4506378173828
Then when she had no longer any doubt she cried in a state of stupor What my brother is it you	77.23290252685547
Yes fair lady replied Lord de Winter making a bow half courteous half ironical it is I myself	13.919281959533691
But this castle then	85.88683319091797
Is mine	67.69233703613281
This chamber	202.51971435546875
Is yours	246.7837677001953
I am then your prisoner	2653.21728515625
Nearly so	250.61422729492188
But this is a frightful abuse of power	150.6827850341797
No highsounding words Let us sit down and chat quietly as brother and sister ought to do	317.2526550292969
Then turning toward the door and seeing that the young officer was waiting for his last orders he said	183.57627868652344
All is well I thank you now leave us alone Mr	63.08217239379883
Chapter L	37.730621337890625
CHAT BETWEEN BROTHER AND SISTER	144.39013671875
During the time which Lord de Winter took to shut the door close a shutter and draw a chair near to his sisterinlaws fauteuil Milady anxiously thoughtful plunged her glance into the depths of possibility and discovered all the plan of which she could not even obtain a glance as long as she was ignorant into whose hands she had fallen	119.71442413330078
She knew her brotherinlaw to be a worthy gentleman a bold hunter an intrepid player enterprising with women but by no means remarkable for his skill in intrigues	23.81151008605957
How had he discovered her arrival and caused her to be seized Why did he detain her	144.73570251464844
Athos had dropped some words which proved that the conversation she had with the cardinal had fallen into outside ears but she could not suppose that he had dug a countermine so promptly and so boldly	61.01441955566406
She rather feared that her preceding operations in England might have been discovered	201.2241668701172
Buckingham might have guessed that it was she who had cut off the two studs and avenge himself for that little treachery but Buckingham was incapable of going to any excess against a woman particularly if that woman was supposed to have acted from a feeling of jealousy	34.84270477294922
This supposition appeared to her most reasonable	55.73644256591797
It seemed to her that they wanted to revenge the past and not to anticipate the future	659.29052734375
At all events she congratulated herself upon having fallen into the hands of her brotherinlaw with whom she reckoned she could deal very easily rather than into the hands of an acknowledged and intelligent enemy	111.1346435546875
Yes let us chat brother said she with a kind of cheerfulness decided as she was to draw from the conversation in spite of all the dissimulation Lord de Winter could bring the revelations of which she stood in need to regulate her future conduct	219.60971069335938
You have then decided to come to England again said Lord de Winter in spite of the resolutions you so often expressed in Paris never to set your feet on British ground	41.407413482666016
Milady replied to this question by another question	332.44525146484375
To begin with tell me said she how have you watched me so closely as to be aware beforehand not only of my arrival but even of the day the hour and the port at which I should arrive	74.4418716430664
Lord de Winter adopted the same tactics as Milady thinking that as his sisterinlaw employed them they must be the best	157.46942138671875
But tell me my dear sister replied he what makes you come to England	167.1592559814453
I come to see you replied Milady without knowing how much she aggravated by this reply the suspicions to which DArtagnans letter had given birth in the mind of her brotherinlaw and only desiring to gain the good will of her auditor by a falsehood	46.996185302734375
Ah to see me said de Winter cunningly	113.33922576904297
To be sure to see you	193.32861328125
What is there astonishing in that	144.3184814453125
And you had no other object in coming to England but to see me	106.83740234375
So it was for me alone you have taken the trouble to cross the Channel	188.27078247070312
For you alone	714.5819091796875
The deuce What tenderness my sister	335.6466979980469
But am I not your nearest relative demanded Milady with a tone of the most touching ingenuousness	125.68231201171875
And my only heir are you not said Lord de Winter in his turn fixing his eyes on those of Milady	361.0794982910156
Whatever command she had over herself Milady could not help starting and as in pronouncing the last words Lord de Winter placed his hand upon the arm of his sister this start did not escape him	88.88075256347656
In fact the blow was direct and severe	545.12255859375
The first idea that occurred to Miladys mind was that she had been betrayed by Kitty and that she had recounted to the baron the selfish aversion toward himself of which she had imprudently allowed some marks to escape before her servant	41.93049621582031
She also recollected the furious and imprudent attack she had made upon DArtagnan when he spared the life of her brother	52.901954650878906
I do not understand my Lord said she in order to gain time and make her adversary speak out	56.536277770996094
What do you mean to say Is there any secret meaning concealed beneath your words	74.49176788330078
Oh my God no said Lord de Winter with apparent good nature	184.90443420410156
You wish to see me and you come to England	555.6846313476562
I learn this desire or rather I suspect that you feel it and in order to spare you all the annoyances of a nocturnal arrival in a port and all the fatigues of landing I send one of my officers to meet you I place a carriage at his orders and he brings you hither to this castle of which I am governor whither I come every day and where in order to satisfy our mutual desire of seeing each other I have prepared you a chamber	219.4855499267578
What is there more astonishing in all that I have said to you than in what you have told me	42.61270523071289
No what I think astonishing is that you should expect my coming	65.58222961425781
And yet that is the most simple thing in the world my dear sister	84.16802215576172
Have you not observed that the captain of your little vessel on entering the roadstead sent forward in order to obtain permission to enter the port a little boat bearing his logbook and the register of his voyagers I am commandant of the port	202.44180297851562
They brought me that book	376.6873779296875
I recognized your name in it	83.23941040039062
My heart told me what your mouth has just confirmedthat is to say with what view you have exposed yourself to the dangers of a sea so perilous or at least so troublesome at this momentand I sent my cutter to meet you	11.948805809020996
You know the rest	89.80477905273438
Milady knew that Lord de Winter lied and she was the more alarmed	10.319926261901855
My brother continued she was not that my Lord Buckingham whom I saw on the jetty this evening as we arrived	198.3098602294922
Ah I can understand how the sight of him struck you replied Lord de Winter	278.6551208496094
You came from a country where he must be very much talked of and I know that his armaments against France greatly engage the attention of your friend the cardinal	164.1039581298828
My friend the cardinal cried Milady seeing that on this point as on the other Lord de Winter seemed well instructed	58.2391357421875
Is he not your friend replied the baron negligently	842.086181640625
Ah pardon I thought so but we will return to my Lord Duke presently	50.04174041748047
Let us not depart from the sentimental turn our conversation had taken	123.42072296142578
You came you say to see me	153.0753936767578
Well I reply that you shall be served to the height of your wishes and that we shall see each other every day	226.81219482421875
Am I then to remain here eternally demanded Milady with a certain terror	153.2684326171875
Do you find yourself badly lodged sister Demand anything you want and I will hasten to have you furnished with it	272.78204345703125
But I have neither my women nor my servants	78.91143798828125
You shall have all madame	87.8192138671875
Tell me on what footing your household was established by your first husband and although I am only your brotherinlaw I will arrange one similar	424.5912780761719
My first husband cried Milady looking at Lord de Winter with eyes almost starting from their sockets	236.78524780273438
Yes your French husband	1930.723388671875
I do nt speak of my brother	387.9444580078125
If you have forgotten as he is still living I can write to him and he will send me information on the subject	285.58306884765625
A cold sweat burst from the brow of Milady	1113.8304443359375
You jest said she in a hollow voice	157.0792236328125
Do I look so asked the baron rising and going a step backward	91.24266815185547
Or rather you insult me continued she pressing with her stiffened hands the two arms of her easy chair and raising herself upon her wrists	2043.206787109375
I insult you said Lord de Winter with contempt	824.8171997070312
In truth madame do you think that can be possible	2593.39111328125
Indeed sir said Milady you must be either drunk or mad	122.1511001586914
Leave the room and send me a woman	189.71383666992188
Women are very indiscreet my sister	946.4281005859375
Can not I serve you as a waiting maid By that means all our secrets will remain in the family	1689.6339111328125
Insolent cried Milady and as if acted upon by a spring she bounded toward the baron who awaited her attack with his arms crossed but nevertheless with one hand on the hilt of his sword	114.12716674804688
Come said he	96.64702606201172
I know you are accustomed to assassinate people but I warn you I shall defend myself even against you	134.1290283203125
You are right said Milady	306.8679504394531
You have all the appearance of being cowardly enough to lift your hand against a woman	57.21831512451172
Perhaps so and I have an excuse for mine would not be the first hand of a man that has been placed upon you I imagine	9.50402545928955
And the baron pointed with a slow and accusing gesture to the left shoulder of Milady which he almost touched with his finger	11.86935806274414
Milady uttered a deep inward shriek and retreated to a corner of the room like a panther which crouches for a spring	62.388912200927734
Oh growl as much as you please cried Lord de Winter but do nt try to bite for I warn you that it would be to your disadvantage	455.24761962890625
There are here no procurators who regulate successions beforehand	54.673648834228516
There is no knighterrant to come and seek a quarrel with me on account of the fair lady I detain a prisoner but I have judges quite ready who will quickly dispose of a woman so shameless as to glide a bigamist into the bed of Lord de Winter my brother	67.45174407958984
And these judges I warn you will soon send you to an executioner who will make both your shoulders alike	302.4974670410156
The eyes of Milady darted such flashes that although he was a man and armed before an unarmed woman he felt the chill of fear glide through his whole frame	83.7955551147461
However he continued all the same but with increasing warmth Yes I can very well understand that after having inherited the fortune of my brother it would be very agreeable to you to be my heir likewise but know beforehand if you kill me or cause me to be killed my precautions are taken	375.78570556640625
Not a penny of what I possess will pass into your hands	176.05447387695312
Were you not already rich enoughyou who possess nearly a million And could you not stop your fatal career if you did not do evil for the infinite and supreme joy of doing it Oh be assured if the memory of my brother were not sacred to me you should rot in a state dungeon or satisfy the curiosity of sailors at Tyburn	526.343505859375
I will be silent but you must endure your captivity quietly	66.49297332763672
In fifteen or twenty days I shall set out for La Rochelle with the army but on the eve of my departure a vessel which I shall see depart will take you hence and convey you to our colonies in the south	236.4605255126953
And be assured that you shall be accompanied by one who will blow your brains out at the first attempt you make to return to England or the Continent	168.34423828125
Milady listened with an attention that dilated her inflamed eyes	125.03995513916016
Yes at present continued Lord de Winter you will remain in this castle	447.5152893066406
The walls are thick the doors strong and the bars solid besides your window opens immediately over the sea	146.70152282714844
The men of my crew who are devoted to me for life and death mount guard around this apartment and watch all the passages that lead to the courtyard	473.7947692871094
Even if you gained the yard there would still be three iron gates for you to pass	250.36972045898438
The order is positive	259.1643981933594
A step a gesture a word on your part denoting an effort to escape and you are to be fired upon	180.91583251953125
If they kill you English justice will be under an obligation to me for having saved it trouble	701.9097900390625
Ah I see your features regain their calmness your countenance recovers its assurance	118.39408874511719
You are saying to yourself Fifteen days twenty days Bah I have an inventive mind before that is expired some idea will occur to me	160.2060546875
I have an infernal spirit	28.35033416748047
I shall meet with a victim	192.09515380859375
Before fifteen days are gone by I shall be away from here	438.736083984375
Ah try it	102.17109680175781
Milady finding her thoughts betrayed dug her nails into her flesh to subdue every emotion that might give to her face any expression except agony	379.9114074707031
Lord de Winter continued The officer who commands here in my absence you have already seen and therefore know him	123.76152038574219
He knows how as you must have observed to obey an orderfor you did not I am sure come from Portsmouth hither without endeavoring to make him speak	2.000459671020508
What do you say of him Could a statue of marble have been more impassive and more mute You have already tried the power of your seductions upon many men and unfortunately you have always succeeded but I give you leave to try them upon this one	235.20249938964844
Pardieu if you succeed with him I pronounce you the demon himself	1194.4061279296875
He went toward the door and opened it hastily	155.14344787597656
Call Mr	256.3223571777344
Felton said he	13.301576614379883
Wait a minute longer and I will introduce him to you	208.35411071777344
There followed between these two personages a strange silence during which the sound of a slow and regular step was heard approaching	3448.8359375
Shortly a human form appeared in the shade of the corridor and the young lieutenant with whom we are already acquainted stopped at the threshold to receive the orders of the baron	1233.1094970703125
Come in my dear John said Lord de Winter come in and shut the door	69.02570343017578
The young officer entered	198.89842224121094
Now said the baron look at this woman	356.71490478515625
She is young she is beautiful she possesses all earthly seductions	198.56410217285156
Well she is a monster who at twentyfive years of age has been guilty of as many crimes as you could read of in a year in the archives of our tribunals	914.2921142578125
Her voice prejudices her hearers in her favor her beauty serves as a bait to her victims her body even pays what she promisesI must do her that justice	138.23789978027344
She will try to seduce you perhaps she will try to kill you	365.72222900390625
I have extricated you from misery Felton I have caused you to be named lieutenant I once saved your life you know on what occasion	299.3114318847656
I am for you not only a protector but a friend not only a benefactor but a father	68.71991729736328
This woman has come back again into England for the purpose of conspiring against my life	376.9556579589844
I hold this serpent in my hands	163.12452697753906
Well I call you and say to you Friend Felton John my child guard me and more particularly guard yourself against this woman	61.23383331298828
Swear by your hopes of salvation to keep her safely for the chastisement she has merited	3378.69921875
John Felton I trust your word John Felton I put faith in your loyalty	415.640625
My Lord said the young officer summoning to his mild countenance all the hatred he could find in his heart my Lord I swear all shall be done as you desire	269.265869140625
Milady received this look like a resigned victim it was impossible to imagine a more submissive or a more mild expression than that which prevailed on her beautiful countenance	54.37420654296875
Lord de Winter himself could scarcely recognize the tigress who a minute before prepared apparently for a fight	176.93833923339844
She is not to leave this chamber understand John continued the baron	112.35848236083984
She is to correspond with nobody she is to speak to no one but youif you will do her the honor to address a word to her	187.49876403808594
That is sufficient my Lord I have sworn	202.08726501464844
And now madame try to make your peace with God for you are judged by men	245.7684326171875
Milady let her head sink as if crushed by this sentence	339.80322265625
Lord de Winter went out making a sign to Felton who followed him shutting the door after him	174.26934814453125
One instant after the heavy step of a marine who served as sentinel was heard in the corridorhis ax in his girdle and his musket on his shoulder	335.0109558105469
Milady remained for some minutes in the same position for she thought they might perhaps be examining her through the keyhole she then slowly raised her head which had resumed its formidable expression of menace and defiance ran to the door to listen looked out of her window and returning to bury herself again in her large armchair she reflected	488.3302307128906
Chapter LI	21.742345809936523
Meanwhile the cardinal looked anxiously for news from England but no news arrived that was not annoying and threatening	136.0816192626953
Although La Rochelle was invested however certain success might appearthanks to the precautions taken and above all to the dyke which prevented the entrance of any vessel into the besieged citythe blockade might last a long time yet	1155.27197265625
This was a great affront to the kings army and a great inconvenience to the cardinal who had no longer it is true to embroil Louis XIII	1023.7832641601562
with Anne of Austriafor that affair was overbut he had to adjust matters for M	391.02105712890625
de Bassompierre who was embroiled with the Duc dAngoulme	186.87379455566406
As to Monsieur who had begun the siege he left to the cardinal the task of finishing it	152.0972137451172
The city notwithstanding the incredible perseverance of its mayor had attempted a sort of mutiny for a surrender the mayor had hanged the mutineers	327.77642822265625
This execution quieted the illdisposed who resolved to allow themselves to die of hungerthis death always appearing to them more slow and less sure than strangulation	154.43295288085938
On their side from time to time the besiegers took the messengers which the Rochellais sent to Buckingham or the spies which Buckingham sent to the Rochellais	76.0675048828125
In one case or the other the trial was soon over	1013.3197631835938
The cardinal pronounced the single word Hanged The king was invited to come and see the hanging	599.3815307617188
He came languidly placing himself in a good situation to see all the details	935.5424194335938
This amused him sometimes a little and made him endure the siege with patience but it did not prevent his getting very tired or from talking at every moment of returning to Parisso that if the messengers and the spies had failed his Eminence notwithstanding all his inventiveness would have found himself much embarrassed	950.7626953125
Nevertheless time passed on and the Rochellais did not surrender	213.88671875
The last spy that was taken was the bearer of a letter	432.6700439453125
This letter told Buckingham that the city was at an extremity but instead of adding If your succor does not arrive within fifteen days we will surrender it added quite simply If your succor comes not within fifteen days we shall all be dead with hunger when it comes	346.1459045410156
The Rochellais then had no hope but in Buckingham	95.75390625
Buckingham was their Messiah	209.37965393066406
It was evident that if they one day learned positively that they must not count on Buckingham their courage would fail with their hope	157.9794158935547
The cardinal looked then with great impatience for the news from England which would announce to him that Buckingham would not come	59.923919677734375
The question of carrying the city by assault though often debated in the council of the king had been always rejected	287.0738525390625
In the first place La Rochelle appeared impregnable	42.732810974121094
Then the cardinal whatever he said very well knew that the horror of bloodshed in this encounter in which Frenchman would combat against Frenchman was a retrograde movement of sixty years impressed upon his policy and the cardinal was at that period what we now call a man of progress	36.496726989746094
In fact the sack of La Rochelle and the assassination of three of four thousand Huguenots who allowed themselves to be killed would resemble too closely in 1628 the massacre of St	97.7244644165039
Bartholomew in 1572 and then above all this this extreme measure which was not at all repugnant to the king good Catholic as he was always fell before this argument of the besieging generalsLa Rochelle is impregnable except to famine	64.2484359741211
The cardinal could not drive from his mind the fear he entertained of his terrible emissaryfor he comprehended the strange qualities of this woman sometimes a serpent sometimes a lion	8.053496360778809
Had she betrayed him Was she dead He knew her well enough in all cases to know that whether acting for or against him as a friend or an enemy she would not remain motionless without great impediments but whence did these impediments arise That was what he could not know	88.29747009277344
And yet he reckoned and with reason on Milady	427.2318115234375
He had divined in the past of this woman terrible things which his red mantle alone could cover and he felt from one cause or another that this woman was his own as she could look to no other but himself for a support superior to the danger which threatened her	176.80540466308594
He resolved then to carry on the war alone and to look for no success foreign to himself but as we look for a fortunate chance	1325.8731689453125
He continued to press the raising of the famous dyke which was to starve La Rochelle	813.6144409179688
Meanwhile he cast his eyes over that unfortunate city which contained so much deep misery and so many heroic virtues and recalling the saying of Louis XI	449.33514404296875
his political predecessor as he himself was the predecessor of Robespierre he repeated this maxim of Tristans gossip Divide in order to reign	483.99615478515625
Henry IV	918.4352416992188
when besieging Paris had loaves and provisions thrown over the walls	945.2951049804688
The cardinal had little notes thrown over in which he represented to the Rochellais how unjust selfish and barbarous was the conduct of their leaders	118.47461700439453
These leaders had corn in abundance and would not let them partake of it they adopted as a maximfor they too had maximsthat it was of very little consequence that women children and old men should die so long as the men who were to defend the walls remained strong and healthy	335.4636535644531
Up to that time whether from devotedness or from want of power to act against it this maxim without being generally adopted nevertheless passed from theory into practice but the notes did it injury	428.3864440917969
The notes reminded the men that the children women and old men whom they allowed to die were their sons their wives and their fathers and that it would be more just for everyone to be reduced to the common misery in order that equal conditions should give birth to unanimous resolutions	160.96197509765625
These notes had all the effect that he who wrote them could expect in that they induced a great number of the inhabitants to open private negotiations with the royal army	122.2945327758789
But at the moment when the cardinal saw his means already bearing fruit and applauded himself for having put it in action an inhabitant of La Rochelle who had contrived to pass the royal linesGod knows how such was the watchfulness of Bassompierre Schomberg and the Duc dAngoulme themselves watched over by the cardinalan inhabitant of La Rochelle we say entered the city coming from Portsmouth and saying that he had seen a magnificent fleet ready to sail within eight days	185.2858123779297
Still further Buckingham announced to the mayor that at length the great league was about to declare itself against France and that the kingdom would be at once invaded by the English Imperial and Spanish armies	352.6015930175781
This letter was read publicly in all parts of the city	405.7038269042969
Copies were put up at the corners of the streets and even they who had begun to open negotiations interrupted them being resolved to await the succor so pompously announced	80.47105407714844
This unexpected circumstance brought back Richelieus former anxiety and forced him in spite of himself once more to turn his eyes to the other side of the sea	116.63172149658203
During this time exempt from the anxiety of its only and true chief the royal army led a joyous life neither provisions nor money being wanting in the camp	393.26007080078125
All the corps rivaled one another in audacity and gaiety	346.52740478515625
To take spies and hang them to make hazardous expeditions upon the dyke or the sea to imagine wild plans and to execute them coollysuch were the pastimes which made the army find these days short which were not only so long to the Rochellais a prey to famine and anxiety but even to the cardinal who blockaded them so closely	65.61178588867188
Sometimes when the cardinal always on horseback like the lowest gendarme of the army cast a pensive glance over those works so slowly keeping pace with his wishes which the engineers brought from all the corners of France were executing under his orders if he met a Musketeer of the company of Trville he drew near and looked at him in a peculiar manner and not recognizing in him one of our four companions he turned his penetrating look and profound thoughts in another direction	172.24398803710938
One day when oppressed with a mortal weariness of mind without hope in the negotiations with the city without news from England the cardinal went out without any other aim than to be out of doors and accompanied only by Cahusac and La Houdinire strolled along the beach	88.80326843261719
Mingling the immensity of his dreams with the immensity of the ocean he came his horse going at a foots pace to a hill from the top of which he perceived behind a hedge reclining on the sand and catching in its passage one of those rays of the sun so rare at this period of the year seven men surrounded by empty bottles	6243.21923828125
Four of these men were our Musketeers preparing to listen to a letter one of them had just received	167.1441192626953
This letter was so important that it made them forsake their cards and their dice on the drumhead	1139.6864013671875
The other three were occupied in opening an enormous flagon of Collicure wine these were the lackeys of these gentlemen	320.988037109375
The cardinal was as we have said in very low spirits and nothing when he was in that state of mind increased his depression so much as gaiety in others	60.8248176574707
Besides he had another strange fancy which was always to believe that the causes of his sadness created the gaiety of others	373.0042724609375
Making a sign to La Houdinire and Cahusac to stop he alighted from his horse and went toward these suspected merry companions hoping by means of the sand which deadened the sound of his steps and of the hedge which concealed his approach to catch some words of this conversation which appeared so interesting	83.47520446777344
At ten paces from the hedge he recognized the talkative Gascon and as he had already perceived that these men were Musketeers he did not doubt that the three others were those called the Inseparables that is to say Athos Porthos and Aramis	253.46141052246094
It may be supposed that his desire to hear the conversation was augmented by this discovery	81.85385131835938
His eyes took a strange expression and with the step of a tigercat he advanced toward the hedge but he had not been able to catch more than a few vague syllables without any positive sense when a sonorous and short cry made him start and attracted the attention of the Musketeers	76.54109191894531
Officer cried Grimaud	60.00060272216797
You are speaking you scoundrel said Athos rising upon his elbow and transfixing Grimaud with his flaming look	2489.661376953125
Grimaud therefore added nothing to his speech but contented himself with pointing his index finger in the direction of the hedge announcing by this gesture the cardinal and his escort	102.93154907226562
With a single bound the Musketeers were on their feet and saluted with respect	97.81924438476562
The cardinal seemed furious	167.85423278808594
It appears that Messieurs the Musketeers keep guard said he	40.091400146484375
Are the English expected by land or do the Musketeers consider themselves superior officers	61.47880172729492
Monseigneur replied Athos for amid the general fright he alone had preserved the noble calmness and coolness that never forsook him Monseigneur the Musketeers when they are not on duty or when their duty is over drink and play at dice and they are certainly superior officers to their lackeys	1579.4725341796875
Lackeys grumbled the cardinal	98.41707611083984
Lackeys who have the order to warn their masters when anyone passes are not lackeys they are sentinels	271.2705078125
Your Eminence may perceive that if we had not taken this precaution we should have been exposed to allowing you to pass without presenting you our respects or offering you our thanks for the favor you have done us in uniting us	353.6089782714844
DArtagnan continued Athos you who but lately were so anxious for such an opportunity for expressing your gratitude to Monseigneur here it is avail yourself of it	60.892459869384766
These words were pronounced with that imperturbable phlegm which distinguished Athos in the hour of danger and with that excessive politeness which made of him at certain moments a king more majestic than kings by birth	53.18973922729492
DArtagnan came forward and stammered out a few words of gratitude which soon expired under the gloomy looks of the cardinal	332.8657531738281
It does not signify gentlemen continued the cardinal without appearing to be in the least swerved from his first intention by the diversion which Athos had started it does not signify gentlemen	110.48721313476562
I do not like to have simple soldiers because they have the advantage of serving in a privileged corps thus to play the great lords discipline is the same for them as for everybody else	103.46190643310547
Athos allowed the cardinal to finish his sentence completely and bowed in sign of assent	45.07592010498047
Then he resumed in his turn Discipline Monseigneur has I hope in no way been forgotten by us	1410.369384765625
We are not on duty and we believed that not being on duty we were at liberty to dispose of our time as we pleased	713.057373046875
If we are so fortunate as to have some particular duty to perform for your Eminence we are ready to obey you	296.3992004394531
Your Eminence may perceive continued Athos knitting his brow for this sort of investigation began to annoy him that we have not come out without our arms	89.41854095458984
And he showed the cardinal with his finger the four muskets piled near the drum on which were the cards and dice	67.29525756835938
Your Eminence may believe added DArtagnan that we would have come to meet you if we could have supposed it was Monseigneur coming toward us with so few attendants	21.204795837402344
The cardinal bit his mustache and even his lips a little	93.52702331542969
Do you know what you look like all together as you are armed and guarded by your lackeys said the cardinal	126.34436798095703
You look like four conspirators	135.58734130859375
Oh as to that Monseigneur it is true said Athos we do conspire as your Eminence might have seen the other morning	214.99423217773438
Only we conspire against the Rochellais	98.03118896484375
Ah you gentlemen of policy replied the cardinal knitting his brow in his turn the secret of many unknown things might perhaps be found in your brains if we could read them as you read that letter which you concealed as soon as you saw me coming	61.81797409057617
The color mounted to the face of Athos and he made a step toward his Eminence	564.6367797851562
One might think you really suspected us monseigneur and we were undergoing a real interrogatory	14824.7099609375
If it be so we trust your Eminence will deign to explain yourself and we should then at least be acquainted with our real position	180.4359588623047
And if it were an interrogatory replied the cardinal	247.68492126464844
Others besides you have undergone such Monsieur Athos and have replied thereto	128.70469665527344
Thus I have told your Eminence that you had but to question us and we are ready to reply	179.41909790039062
What was that letter you were about to read Monsieur Aramis and which you so promptly concealed	98.12874603271484
A womans letter monseigneur	47.143310546875
Ah yes I see said the cardinal we must be discreet with this sort of letters but nevertheless we may show them to a confessor and you know I have taken orders	179.04135131835938
Monseigneur said Athos with a calmness the more terrible because he risked his head in making this reply the letter is a womans letter but it is neither signed Marion de Lorme nor Madame dAiguillon	59.0792236328125
The cardinal became as pale as death lightning darted from his eyes	121.2117691040039
He turned round as if to give an order to Cahusac and Houdinire	5.008423328399658
Athos saw the movement he made a step toward the muskets upon which the other three friends had fixed their eyes like men illdisposed to allow themselves to be taken	91.55964660644531
The cardinalists were three the Musketeers lackeys included were seven	130.44288635253906
He judged that the match would be so much the less equal if Athos and his companions were really plotting and by one of those rapid turns which he always had at command all his anger faded away into a smile	241.98895263671875
Well well said he you are brave young men proud in daylight faithful in darkness	1416.6451416015625
We can find no fault with you for watching over yourselves when you watch so carefully over others	578.0049438476562
Gentlemen I have not forgotten the night in which you served me as an escort to the Red Dovecot	200.72860717773438
If there were any danger to be apprehended on the road I am going I would request you to accompany me but as there is none remain where you are finish your bottles your game and your letter	137.44541931152344
Adieu gentlemen	136.17462158203125
And remounting his horse which Cahusac led to him he saluted them with his hand and rode away	753.7070922851562
The four young men standing and motionless followed him with their eyes without speaking a single word until he had disappeared	21.742345809936523
Then they looked at one another	37.55469512939453
The countenances of all gave evidence of terror for notwithstanding the friendly adieu of his Eminence they plainly perceived that the cardinal went away with rage in his heart	182.48446655273438
Athos alone smiled with a selfpossessed disdainful smile	81.40983581542969
When the cardinal was out of hearing and sight That Grimaud kept bad watch cried Porthos who had a great inclination to vent his illhumor on somebody	350.9605712890625
Grimaud was about to reply to excuse himself	188.71524047851562
Athos lifted his finger and Grimaud was silent	127.32290649414062
Would you have given up the letter Aramis said DArtagnan	528.3206787109375
I said Aramis in his most flutelike tone I had made up my mind	229.0384521484375
If he had insisted upon the letter being given up to him I would have presented the letter to him with one hand and with the other I would have run my sword through his body	259.4893798828125
I expected as much said Athos and that was why I threw myself between you and him	53.19466018676758
Indeed this man is very much to blame for talking thus to other men one would say he had never had to do with any but women and children	252.9469451904297
My dear Athos I admire you but nevertheless we were in the wrong after all	55.86876678466797
How in the wrong said Athos	23.838214874267578
Whose then is the air we breathe Whose is the ocean upon which we look Whose is the sand upon which we were reclining Whose is that letter of your mistress Do these belong to the cardinal Upon my honor this man fancies the world belongs to him	12.426268577575684
There you stood stammering stupefied annihilated	83.86083221435547
One might have supposed the Bastille appeared before you and that the gigantic Medusa had converted you into stone	232.09381103515625
Is being in love conspiring You are in love with a woman whom the cardinal has caused to be shut up and you wish to get her out of the hands of the cardinal	81.53998565673828
That s a match you are playing with his Eminence this letter is your game	295126.25
Why should you expose your game to your adversary That is never done	41.810333251953125
Let him find it out if he can We can find out his	24.242238998413086
Well that s all very sensible Athos said DArtagnan	53.15155792236328
In that case let there be no more question of what s past and let Aramis resume the letter from his cousin where the cardinal interrupted him	15131.5966796875
Aramis drew the letter from his pocket the three friends surrounded him and the three lackeys grouped themselves again near the wine jar	163.8055419921875
You had only read a line or two said DArtagnan read the letter again from the commencement	322.4901428222656
Willingly said Aramis	1042.07666015625
MY DEAR COUSIN I think I shall make up my mind to set out for Bthune where my sister has placed our little servant in the convent of the Carmelites this poor child is quite resigned as she knows she can not live elsewhere without the salvation of her soul being in danger	2.000459671020508
Nevertheless if the affairs of our family are arranged as we hope they will be I believe she will run the risk of being damned and will return to those she regrets particularly as she knows they are always thinking of her	53.87067794799805
Meanwhile she is not very wretched what she most desires is a letter from her intended	90.57825469970703
I know that such viands pass with difficulty through convent gratings but after all as I have given you proofs my dear cousin I am not unskilled in such affairs and I will take charge of the commission	384.6893005371094
My sister thanks you for your good and eternal remembrance	321.6974792480469
She has experienced much anxiety but she is now at length a little reassured having sent her secretary away in order that nothing may happen unexpectedly	5562.12451171875
Adieu my dear cousin	550.0341796875
Tell us news of yourself as often as you can that is to say as often as you can with safety	138.4287872314453
I embrace you	564.9149780273438
MARIE MICHON	170.30450439453125
Oh what do I not owe you Aramis said DArtagnan	183.9710693359375
Dear Constance I have at length then intelligence of you	40.75337219238281
She lives she is in safety in a convent she is at Bthune Where is Bthune Athos	643.9154663085938
Why upon the frontiers of Artois and of Flanders	243.43667602539062
The siege once over we shall be able to make a tour in that direction	1835.137939453125
And that will not be long it is to be hoped said Porthos for they have this morning hanged a spy who confessed that the Rochellais were reduced to the leather of their shoes	105.55731201171875
Supposing that after having eaten the leather they eat the soles I can not see much that is left unless they eat one another	686.5487670898438
Poor fools said Athos emptying a glass of excellent Bordeaux wine which without having at that period the reputation it now enjoys merited it no less poor fools As if the Catholic religion was not the most advantageous and the most agreeable of all religions All the same resumed he after having clicked his tongue against his palate they are brave fellows But what the devil are you about Aramis continued Athos	525.5700073242188
Why you are squeezing that letter into your pocket	152.95639038085938
Yes said DArtagnan Athos is right it must be burned	460.42840576171875
And yet if we burn it who knows whether Monsieur Cardinal has not a secret to interrogate ashes	143.44119262695312
He must have one said Athos	175.57937622070312
What will you do with the letter then asked Porthos	401.9686584472656
Come here Grimaud said Athos	321.43865966796875
Grimaud rose and obeyed	110.40226745605469
As a punishment for having spoken without permission my friend you will please to eat this piece of paper then to recompense you for the service you will have rendered us you shall afterward drink this glass of wine	1011.8167724609375
First here is the letter	44.17440414428711
Eat heartily	1499.4522705078125
Grimaud smiled and with his eyes fixed upon the glass which Athos held in his hand he ground the paper well between his teeth and then swallowed it	122.55523681640625
Bravo Monsieur Grimaud said Athos and now take this	179.1431427001953
That s well	1747.7598876953125
We dispense with your saying grace	546.6387329101562
Grimaud silently swallowed the glass of Bordeaux wine but his eyes raised toward heaven during this delicious occupation spoke a language which though mute was not the less expressive	39.95079040527344
And now said Athos unless Monsieur Cardinal should form the ingenious idea of ripping up Grimaud I think we may be pretty much at our ease respecting the letter	194.0199432373047
Meantime his Eminence continued his melancholy ride murmuring between his mustaches These four men must positively be mine	295.84906005859375
Chapter LII	638.5502319335938
CAPTIVITY THE FIRST DAY	68.66515350341797
Let us return to Milady whom a glance thrown upon the coast of France has made us lose sight of for an instant	71.46125793457031
We shall find her still in the despairing attitude in which we left her plunged in an abyss of dismal reflectiona dark hell at the gate of which she has almost left hope behind because for the first time she doubts for the first time she fears	151.9519500732422
On two occasions her fortune has failed her on two occasions she has found herself discovered and betrayed and on these two occasions it was to one fatal genius sent doubtlessly by the Lord to combat her that she has succumbed	557.2791137695312
DArtagnan has conquered herher that invincible power of evil	319.7071838378906
He has deceived her in her love humbled her in her pride thwarted her in her ambition and now he ruins her fortune deprives her of liberty and even threatens her life	147.4644317626953
Still more he has lifted the corner of her maskthat shield with which she covered herself and which rendered her so strong	164.2581024169922
DArtagnan has turned aside from Buckingham whom she hates as she hates everyone she has loved the tempest with which Richelieu threatened him in the person of the queen	399.01171875
DArtagnan had passed himself upon her as De Wardes for whom she had conceived one of those tigerlike fancies common to women of her character	320.20745849609375
DArtagnan knows that terrible secret which she has sworn no one shall know without dying	322.0813293457031
In short at the moment in which she has just obtained from Richelieu a carte blanche by the means of which she is about to take vengeance on her enemy this precious paper is torn from her hands and it is DArtagnan who holds her prisoner and is about to send her to some filthy Botany Bay some infamous Tyburn of the Indian Ocean	341.25848388671875
All this she owes to DArtagnan without doubt	45.120758056640625
From whom can come so many disgraces heaped upon her head if not from him He alone could have transmitted to Lord de Winter all these frightful secrets which he has discovered one after another by a train of fatalities	55.488525390625
He knows her brotherinlaw	889.4410400390625
He must have written to him	40.2469596862793
What hatred she distills Motionless with her burning and fixed glances in her solitary apartment how well the outbursts of passion which at times escape from the depths of her chest with her respiration accompany the sound of the surf which rises growls roars and breaks itself like an eternal and powerless despair against the rocks on which is built this dark and lofty castle How many magnificent projects of vengeance she conceives by the light of the flashes which her tempestuous passion casts over her mind against Mme	251.9573211669922
Bonacieux against Buckingham but above all against DArtagnanprojects lost in the distance of the future	214.11683654785156
Yes but in order to avenge herself she must be free	445.34417724609375
And to be free a prisoner has to pierce a wall detach bars cut through a floorall undertakings which a patient and strong man may accomplish but before which the feverish irritations of a woman must give way	99.08893585205078
Besides to do all this time is necessarymonths years and she has ten or twelve days as Lord de Winter her fraternal and terrible jailer has told her	48.26641082763672
And yet if she were a man she would attempt all this and perhaps might succeed why then did heaven make the mistake of placing that manlike soul in that frail and delicate body	160.0164794921875
The first moments of her captivity were terrible a few convulsions of rage which she could not suppress paid her debt of feminine weakness to nature	137.42410278320312
But by degrees she overcame the outbursts of her mad passion and nervous tremblings which agitated her frame disappeared and she remained folded within herself like a fatigued serpent in repose	97.17993927001953
Go to go to I must have been mad to allow myself to be carried away so says she gazing into the glass which reflects back to her eyes the burning glance by which she appears to interrogate herself	520.936767578125
No violence violence is the proof of weakness	151.83816528320312
In the first place I have never succeeded by that means	50.14834976196289
Perhaps if I employed my strength against women I might perchance find them weaker than myself and consequently conquer them but it is with men that I struggle and I am but a woman to them	288.4112243652344
Let me fight like a woman then my strength is in my weakness	357.19964599609375
Then as if to render an account to herself of the changes she could place upon her countenance so mobile and so expressive she made it take all expressions from that of passionate anger which convulsed her features to that of the most sweet most affectionate and most seducing smile	93.5396499633789
Then her hair assumed successively under her skillful hands all the undulations she thought might assist the charms of her face	124.387939453125
At length she murmured satisfied with herself Come nothing is lost I am still beautiful	111.32389068603516
It was then nearly eight oclock in the evening	185.354736328125
Milady perceived a bed she calculated that the repose of a few hours would not only refresh her head and her ideas but still further her complexion	129.35829162597656
A better idea however came into her mind before going to bed	223.37376403808594
She had heard something said about supper	992.7613525390625
She had already been an hour in this apartment they could not long delay bringing her a repast	227.77354431152344
The prisoner did not wish to lose time and she resolved to make that very evening some attempts to ascertain the nature of the ground she had to work upon by studying the characters of the men to whose guardianship she was committed	33.27157974243164
A light appeared under the door this light announced the reappearance of her jailers	284.7280578613281
Milady who had arisen threw herself quickly into the armchair her head thrown back her beautiful hair unbound and disheveled her bosom half bare beneath her crumpled lace one hand on her heart and the other hanging down	451.7698974609375
The bolts were drawn the door groaned upon its hinges	55.634586334228516
Steps sounded in the chamber and drew near	118.58375549316406
Place that table there said a voice which the prisoner recognized as that of Felton	55.88904571533203
The order was executed	52.737274169921875
You will bring lights and relieve the sentinel continued Felton	324.208984375
And this double order which the young lieutenant gave to the same individuals proved to Milady that her servants were the same men as her guards that is to say soldiers	145.8892364501953
Feltons orders were for the rest executed with a silent rapidity that gave a good idea of the way in which he maintained discipline	200.63157653808594
At length Felton who had not yet looked at Milady turned toward her	43.49087142944336
Ah ah said he she is asleep that s well	583.6345825195312
When she wakes she can sup	497.712158203125
And he made some steps toward the door	390.1913146972656
But my lieutenant said a soldier less stoical than his chief and who had approached Milady this woman is not asleep	71.5712661743164
What not asleep said Felton what is she doing then	114.52249908447266
She has fainted	67.51915740966797
Her face is very pale and I have listened in vain I do not hear her breathe	103.13656616210938
You are right said Felton after having looked at Milady from the spot on which he stood without moving a step toward her	109.35616302490234
Go and tell Lord de Winter that his prisoner has faintedfor this event not having been foreseen I do nt know what to do	1582.9189453125
The soldier went out to obey the orders of his officer	62.45162582397461
Felton sat down upon an armchair which happened to be near the door and waited without speaking a word without making a gesture	70.4842758178711
Milady possessed that great art so much studied by women of looking through her long eyelashes without appearing to open the lids	66.03948211669922
She perceived Felton who sat with his back toward her	2901.419189453125
She continued to look at him for nearly ten minutes and in these ten minutes the immovable guardian never turned round once	112.46000671386719
She then thought that Lord de Winter would come and by his presence give fresh strength to her jailer	2089.805908203125
Her first trial was lost she acted like a woman who reckons up her resources	91.3254165649414
As a result she raised her head opened her eyes and sighed deeply	994.662841796875
At this sigh Felton turned round	31.592500686645508
Ah you are awake madame he said then I have nothing more to do here	75.66136932373047
If you want anything you can ring	311.2879638671875
Oh my God my God how I have suffered said Milady in that harmonious voice which like that of the ancient enchantresses charmed all whom she wished to destroy	128.48216247558594
And she assumed upon sitting up in the armchair a still more graceful and abandoned position than when she reclined	192.62229919433594
Felton arose	399.53680419921875
You will be served thus madame three times a day said he	332.7351379394531
In the morning at nine oclock in the day at one oclock and in the evening at eight	70.8191146850586
If that does not suit you you can point out what other hours you prefer and in this respect your wishes will be complied with	66.19772338867188
But am I to remain always alone in this vast and dismal chamber asked Milady	106.67002868652344
A woman of the neighbourhood has been sent for who will be tomorrow at the castle and will return as often as you desire her presence	170.29637145996094
I thank you sir replied the prisoner humbly	80.28829956054688
Felton made a slight bow and directed his steps toward the door	260.8011779785156
At the moment he was about to go out Lord de Winter appeared in the corridor followed by the soldier who had been sent to inform him of the swoon of Milady	340.0929260253906
He held a vial of salts in his hand	357.5341796875
Well what is itwhat is going on here said he in a jeering voice on seeing the prisoner sitting up and Felton about to go out	773.34619140625
Is this corpse come to life already Felton my lad did you not perceive that you were taken for a novice and that the first act was being performed of a comedy of which we shall doubtless have the pleasure of following out all the developments	305.871337890625
I thought so my lord said Felton but as the prisoner is a woman after all I wish to pay her the attention that every man of gentle birth owes to a woman if not on her account at least on my own	101.29032897949219
Milady shuddered through her whole system	397.7478942871094
These words of Feltons passed like ice through her veins	121.83772277832031
So replied de Winter laughing that beautiful hair so skillfully disheveled that white skin and that languishing look have not yet seduced you you heart of stone	177.25364685058594
No my Lord replied the impassive young man your Lordship may be assured that it requires more than the tricks and coquetry of a woman to corrupt me	796.4116821289062
In that case my brave lieutenant let us leave Milady to find out something else and go to supper but be easy She has a fruitful imagination and the second act of the comedy will not delay its steps after the first	680.04345703125
And at these words Lord de Winter passed his arm through that of Felton and led him out laughing	38.87622833251953
Oh I will be a match for you murmured Milady between her teeth be assured of that you poor spoiled monk you poor converted soldier who has cut his uniform out of a monks frock	193.60389709472656
By the way resumed de Winter stopping at the threshold of the door you must not Milady let this check take away your appetite	2.000459671020508
Taste that fowl and those fish	83.6380386352539
On my honor they are not poisoned	117.74158477783203
I have a very good cook and he is not to be my heir I have full and perfect confidence in him	1146.4034423828125
Do as I do	72.55844116210938
Adieu dear sister till your next swoon	72.5722885131836
This was all that Milady could endure	82.38761901855469
Her hands clutched her armchair she ground her teeth inwardly her eyes followed the motion of the door as it closed behind Lord de Winter and Felton and the moment she was alone a fresh fit of despair seized her	2012.251220703125
She cast her eyes upon the table saw the glittering of a knife rushed toward it and clutched it but her disappointment was cruel	127.47520446777344
The blade was round and of flexible silver	446737.125
A burst of laughter resounded from the other side of the illclosed door and the door reopened	215.1528778076172
Ha ha cried Lord de Winter ha ha Do nt you see my brave Felton do nt you see what I told you That knife was for you my lad she would have killed you	97.66473388671875
Observe this is one of her peculiarities to get rid thus after one fashion or another of all the people who bother her	344.2427978515625
If I had listened to you the knife would have been pointed and of steel	284.5160827636719
Then no more of Felton she would have cut your throat and after that everybody elses	146.2895050048828
See John see how well she knows how to handle a knife	115.66059112548828
In fact Milady still held the harmless weapon in her clenched hand but these last words this supreme insult relaxed her hands her strength and even her will	146.24270629882812
The knife fell to the ground	368.7629089355469
You were right my Lord said Felton with a tone of profound disgust which sounded to the very bottom of the heart of Milady you were right my Lord and I was wrong	61.751773834228516
And both again left the room	145.7836151123047
But this time Milady lent a more attentive ear than the first and she heard their steps die away in the distance of the corridor	436.5561828613281
I am lost murmured she I am lost I am in the power of men upon whom I can have no more influence than upon statues of bronze or granite they know me by heart and are steeled against all my weapons	51.22175979614258
It is however impossible that this should end as they have decreed	86.20095825195312
In fact as this last reflection indicatedthis instinctive return to hopesentiments of weakness or fear did not dwell long in her ardent spirit	1313.320068359375
Milady sat down to table ate from several dishes drank a little Spanish wine and felt all her resolution return	152.67474365234375
Before she went to bed she had pondered analyzed turned on all sides examined on all points the words the steps the gestures the signs and even the silence of her interlocutors and of this profound skillful and anxious study the result was that Felton everything considered appeared the more vulnerable of her two persecutors	121.24195098876953
One expression above all recurred to the mind of the prisoner If I had listened to you Lord de Winter had said to Felton	114.3580322265625
Felton then had spoken in her favor since Lord de Winter had not been willing to listen to him	239.13331604003906
Weak or strong repeated Milady that man has then a spark of pity in his soul of that spark I will make a flame that shall devour him	112.26861572265625
As to the other he knows me he fears me and knows what he has to expect of me if ever I escape from his hands	86.55889129638672
It is useless then to attempt anything with him	327.27117919921875
But Feltonthats another thing	17.75382423400879
He is a young ingenuous pure man who seems virtuous him there are means of destroying	150.33941650390625
And Milady went to bed and fell asleep with a smile upon her lips	121.56033325195312
Anyone who had seen her sleeping might have said she was a young girl dreaming of the crown of flowers she was to wear on her brow at the next festival	136.1610565185547
Chapter LIII	253.21182250976562
CAPTIVITY THE SECOND DAY	65.29444122314453
Milady dreamed that she at length had DArtagnan in her power that she was present at his execution and it was the sight of his odious blood flowing beneath the ax of the headsman which spread that charming smile upon her lips	454.6085510253906
She slept as a prisoner sleeps rocked by his first hope	95.59896850585938
In the morning when they entered her chamber she was still in bed	451.7854309082031
Felton remained in the corridor	188.12701416015625
He brought with him the woman of whom he had spoken the evening before and who had just arrived this woman entered and approaching Miladys bed offered her services	432.615966796875
Milady was habitually pale her complexion might therefore deceive a person who saw her for the first time	663.80517578125
I am in a fever said she I have not slept a single instant during all this long night	944.2697143554688
I suffer horribly	503.7310791015625
Are you likely to be more humane to me than others were yesterday All I ask is permission to remain abed	382.68536376953125
Would you like to have a physician called said the woman	133.4477081298828
Felton listened to this dialogue without speaking a word	125.33592224121094
Milady reflected that the more people she had around her the more she would have to work upon and Lord de Winter would redouble his watch	41.426361083984375
Besides the physician might declare the ailment feigned and Milady after having lost the first trick was not willing to lose the second	79.12141418457031
Go and fetch a physician said she	374.9068908691406
What could be the good of that These gentlemen declared yesterday that my illness was a comedy it would be just the same today no doubtfor since yesterday evening they have had plenty of time to send for a doctor	153.40573120117188
Then said Felton who became impatient say yourself madame what treatment you wish followed	145.0015106201172
Eh how can I tell My God I know that I suffer that s all	233.0369873046875
Give me anything you like it is of little consequence	118.62442779541016
Go and fetch Lord de Winter said Felton tired of these eternal complaints	71.12867736816406
Oh no no cried Milady no sir do not call him I conjure you	276.9537048339844
I am well I want nothing do not call him	260.8704528808594
She gave so much vehemence such magnetic eloquence to this exclamation that Felton in spite of himself advanced some steps into the room	194.9239959716797
He has come thought Milady	8.653480529785156
Meanwhile madame if you really suffer said Felton a physician shall be sent for and if you deceive uswell it will be the worse for you	296.55865478515625
But at least we shall not have to reproach ourselves with anything	216.27188110351562
Milady made no reply but turning her beautiful head round upon her pillow she burst into tears and uttered heartbreaking sobs	120.13008880615234
Felton surveyed her for an instant with his usual impassiveness then seeing that the crisis threatened to be prolonged he went out	126.45912170410156
The woman followed him and Lord de Winter did not appear	102.39628601074219
I fancy I begin to see my way murmured Milady with a savage joy burying herself under the clothes to conceal from anybody who might be watching her this burst of inward satisfaction	38.52616500854492
Two hours passed away	368.0956726074219
Now it is time that the malady should be over said she let me rise and obtain some success this very day	278.97711181640625
I have but ten days and this evening two of them will be gone	242.5913543701172
In the morning when they entered Miladys chamber they had brought her breakfast	260.3041076660156
Now she thought they could not long delay coming to clear the table and that Felton would then reappear	112.86054229736328
Milady was not deceived	242.84376525878906
Felton reappeared and without observing whether Milady had or had not touched her repast made a sign that the table should be carried out of the room it having been brought in ready spread	246.24412536621094
Felton remained behind he held a book in his hand	166.218017578125
Milady reclining in an armchair near the chimney beautiful pale and resigned looked like a holy virgin awaiting martyrdom	251.81895446777344
Felton approached her and said Lord de Winter who is a Catholic like yourself madame thinking that the deprivation of the rites and ceremonies of your church might be painful to you has consented that you should read every day the ordinary of your Mass and here is a book which contains the ritual	62.03944778442383
At the manner in which Felton laid the book upon the little table near which Milady was sitting at the tone in which he pronounced the two words your Mass at the disdainful smile with which he accompanied them Milady raised her head and looked more attentively at the officer	803.1008911132812
By that plain arrangement of the hair by that costume of extreme simplicity by the brow polished like marble and as hard and impenetrable she recognized one of those gloomy Puritans she had so often met not only in the court of King James but in that of the King of France where in spite of the remembrance of the St	263.31634521484375
Bartholomew they sometimes came to seek refuge	76001.6328125
She then had one of those sudden inspirations which only people of genius receive in great crises in supreme moments which are to decide their fortunes or their lives	17.75382423400879
Those two words your Mass and a simple glance cast upon Felton revealed to her all the importance of the reply she was about to make but with that rapidity of intelligence which was peculiar to her this reply ready arranged presented itself to her lips	280.7016296386719
I said she with an accent of disdain in unison with that which she had remarked in the voice of the young officer I sir My Mass Lord de Winter the corrupted Catholic knows very well that I am not of his religion and this is a snare he wishes to lay for me	184.38197326660156
And of what religion are you then madame asked Felton with an astonishment which in spite of the empire he held over himself he could not entirely conceal	57.216896057128906
I will tell it cried Milady with a feigned exultation on the day when I shall have suffered sufficiently for my faith	232.0980224609375
The look of Felton revealed to Milady the full extent of the space she had opened for herself by this single word	238.62518310546875
The young officer however remained mute and motionless his look alone had spoken	532.2833251953125
I am in the hands of my enemies continued she with that tone of enthusiasm which she knew was familiar to the Puritans	102.10077667236328
Well let my God save me or let me perish for my God That is the reply I beg you to make to Lord de Winter	299.0508117675781
And as to this book added she pointing to the manual with her finger but without touching it as if she must be contaminated by it you may carry it back and make use of it yourself for doubtless you are doubly the accomplice of Lord de Winterthe accomplice in his persecutions the accomplice in his heresies	100.58319854736328
Felton made no reply took the book with the same appearance of repugnance which he had before manifested and retired pensively	124.49178314208984
Lord de Winter came toward five oclock in the evening	451.27386474609375
Milady had had time during the whole day to trace her plan of conduct	134.54579162597656
She received him like a woman who had already recovered all her advantages	2077.497314453125
It appears said the baron seating himself in the armchair opposite that occupied by Milady and stretching out his legs carelessly upon the hearth it appears we have made a little apostasy	168.31871032714844
What do you mean sir	126.40142059326172
I mean to say that since we last met you have changed your religion	1416.16357421875
You have not by chance married a Protestant for a third husband have you	641.3112182617188
Explain yourself my Lord replied the prisoner with majesty for though I hear your words I declare I do not understand them	508.41619873046875
Then you have no religion at all I like that best replied Lord de Winter laughing	171.395751953125
Certainly that is most in accord with your own principles replied Milady frigidly	324.115478515625
Oh I confess it is all the same to me	379.9632263183594
Oh you need not avow this religious indifference my Lord your debaucheries and crimes would vouch for it	2486.398681640625
What you talk of debaucheries Madame Messalina Lady Macbeth Either I misunderstand you or you are very shameless	104.36300659179688
You only speak thus because you are overheard coolly replied Milady and you wish to interest your jailers and your hangmen against me	114.37166595458984
My jailers and my hangmen Heyday madame you are taking a poetical tone and the comedy of yesterday turns to a tragedy this evening	752.4276733398438
As to the rest in eight days you will be where you ought to be and my task will be completed	1198.8916015625
Infamous task impious task cried Milady with the exultation of a victim who provokes his judge	250.2662353515625
My word said de Winter rising I think the hussy is going mad Come come calm yourself Madame Puritan or Ill remove you to a dungeon	196.72344970703125
Its my Spanish wine that has got into your head is it not But never mind that sort of intoxication is not dangerous and will have no bad effects	588.4037475585938
And Lord de Winter retired swearing which at that period was a very knightly habit	1246.6768798828125
Felton was indeed behind the door and had not lost one word of this scene	98.7220687866211
Milady had guessed aright	73.7647476196289
Yes go go said she to her brother the effects are drawing near on the contrary but you weak fool will not see them until it is too late to shun them	92.60672760009766
Silence was reestablished	385.0580139160156
Two hours passed away	157.5470733642578
Miladys supper was brought in and she was found deeply engaged in saying her prayers aloudprayers which she had learned of an old servant of her second husband a most austere Puritan	162.84474182128906
She appeared to be in ecstasy and did not pay the least attention to what was going on around her	149.49032592773438
Felton made a sign that she should not be disturbed and when all was arranged he went out quietly with the soldiers	131.33450317382812
Milady knew she might be watched so she continued her prayers to the end and it appeared to her that the soldier who was on duty at her door did not march with the same step and seemed to listen	108.90416717529297
For the moment she wished nothing better	130.5845947265625
She arose came to the table ate but little and drank only water	94.26407623291016
An hour after her table was cleared but Milady remarked that this time Felton did not accompany the soldiers	264.5751647949219
He feared then to see her too often	146.9987030029297
She turned toward the wall to smilefor there was in this smile such an expression of triumph that this smile alone would have betrayed her	624.76171875
She allowed therefore half an hour to pass away and as at that moment all was silence in the old castle as nothing was heard but the eternal murmur of the wavesthat immense breaking of the oceanwith her pure harmonious and powerful voice she began the first couplet of the psalm then in great favor with the Puritans	2.000459671020508
Thou leavest thy servants Lord To see if they be strong But soon thou dost afford Thy hand to lead them on	74.2851791381836
These verses were not excellentvery far from it but as it is well known the Puritans did not pique themselves upon their poetry	97.33538818359375
While singing Milady listened	168.38323974609375
The soldier on guard at her door stopped as if he had been changed into stone	137.9193572998047
Milady was then able to judge of the effect she had produced	50.820735931396484
Then she continued her singing with inexpressible fervor and feeling	134.47183227539062
It appeared to her that the sounds spread to a distance beneath the vaulted roofs and carried with them a magic charm to soften the hearts of her jailers	210.06246948242188
It however likewise appeared that the soldier on dutya zealous Catholic no doubtshook off the charm for through the door he called Hold your tongue madame Your song is as dismal as a De profundis and if besides the pleasure of being in garrison here we must hear such things as these no mortal can hold out	461.9949035644531
Silence then exclaimed another stern voice which Milady recognized as that of Felton	418.8201904296875
What are you meddling with stupid Did anybody order you to prevent that woman from singing No	425.36334228515625
You were told to guard herto fire at her if she attempted to fly	196.9069061279297
Guard her If she flies kill her but do nt exceed your orders	129.0231170654297
An expression of unspeakable joy lightened the countenance of Milady but this expression was fleeting as the reflection of lightning	160.2443389892578
Without appearing to have heard the dialogue of which she had not lost a word she began again giving to her voice all the charm all the power all the seduction the demon had bestowed upon it	93.5980453491211
For all my tears my cares My exile and my chains I have my youth my prayers And God who counts my pains	2112.23291015625
Her voice of immense power and sublime expression gave to the rude unpolished poetry of these psalms a magic and an effect which the most exalted Puritans rarely found in the songs of their brethren and which they were forced to ornament with all the resources of their imagination	186.47857666015625
Felton believed he heard the singing of the angel who consoled the three Hebrews in the furnace	50.68998336791992
Milady continued	1290.569580078125
One day our doors will ope With God come our desire And if betrays that hope To death we can aspire	39.28095626831055
This verse into which the terrible enchantress threw her whole soul completed the trouble which had seized the heart of the young officer	77.20050048828125
He opened the door quickly and Milady saw him appear pale as usual but with his eye inflamed and almost wild	121.58161163330078
Why do you sing thus and with such a voice said he	247.9108428955078
Your pardon sir said Milady with mildness	359.5601501464844
I forgot that my songs are out of place in this castle	467.16021728515625
I have perhaps offended you in your creed but it was without wishing to do so I swear	64.50377655029297
Pardon me then a fault which is perhaps great but which certainly was involuntary	93.61933898925781
Milady was so beautiful at this moment the religious ecstasy in which she appeared to be plunged gave such an expression to her countenance that Felton was so dazzled that he fancied he beheld the angel whom he had only just before heard	362.8796081542969
Yes yes said he you disturb you agitate the people who live in the castle	190.25357055664062
The poor senseless young man was not aware of the incoherence of his words while Milady was reading with her lynxs eyes the very depths of his heart	847.092041015625
I will be silent then said Milady casting down her eyes with all the sweetness she could give to her voice with all the resignation she could impress upon her manner	179.53977966308594
No no madame said Felton only do not sing so loud particularly at night	103.78580474853516
And at these words Felton feeling that he could not long maintain his severity toward his prisoner rushed out of the room	53.2608528137207
You have done right Lieutenant said the soldier	131.0867462158203
Such songs disturb the mind and yet we become accustomed to them her voice is so beautiful	62.17531967163086
Chapter LIV	39.894805908203125
CAPTIVITY THE THIRD DAY	153.8616943359375
Felton had fallen but there was still another step to be taken	198.28460693359375
He must be retained or rather he must be left quite alone and Milady but obscurely perceived the means which could lead to this result	57.17866134643555
Still more must be done	97.685791015625
He must be made to speak in order that he might be spoken tofor Milady very well knew that her greatest seduction was in her voice which so skillfully ran over the whole gamut of tones from human speech to language celestial	198.30123901367188
Yet in spite of all this seduction Milady might failfor Felton was forewarned and that against the least chance	209.32286071777344
From that moment she watched all his actions all his words from the simplest glance of his eyes to his gestureseven to a breath that could be interpreted as a sigh	148.74571228027344
In short she studied everything as a skillful comedian does to whom a new part has been assigned in a line to which he is not accustomed	71.26780700683594
Face to face with Lord de Winter her plan of conduct was more easy	738.6558837890625
She had laid that down the preceding evening	281.6576232910156
To remain silent and dignified in his presence from time to time to irritate him by affected disdain by a contemptuous word to provoke him to threats and violence which would produce a contrast with her own resignationsuch was her plan	1387.008056640625
Felton would see all perhaps he would say nothing but he would see	62.332237243652344
In the morning Felton came as usual but Milady allowed him to preside over all the preparations for breakfast without addressing a word to him	853.0791015625
At the moment when he was about to retire she was cheered with a ray of hope for she thought he was about to speak but his lips moved without any sound leaving his mouth and making a powerful effort to control himself he sent back to his heart the words that were about to escape from his lips and went out	40.25425720214844
Toward midday Lord de Winter entered	93.09596252441406
It was a tolerably fine winters day and a ray of that pale English sun which lights but does not warm came through the bars of her prison	43.05466079711914
Milady was looking out at the window and pretended not to hear the door as it opened	343.3324890136719
Ah ah said Lord de Winter after having played comedy after having played tragedy we are now playing melancholy	12.894065856933594
The prisoner made no reply	356.6484069824219
Yes yes continued Lord de Winter I understand	3713.20703125
You would like very well to be at liberty on that beach You would like very well to be in a good ship dancing upon the waves of that emeraldgreen sea you would like very well either on land or on the ocean to lay for me one of those nice little ambuscades you are so skillful in planning	526.3359375
Patience patience In four days time the shore will be beneath your feet the sea will be open to youmore open than will perhaps be agreeable to you for in four days England will be relieved of you	623.4219360351562
Milady folded her hands and raising her fine eyes toward heaven Lord Lord said she with an angelic meekness of gesture and tone pardon this man as I myself pardon him	48.0146484375
Yes pray accursed woman cried the baron your prayer is so much the more generous from your being I swear to you in the power of a man who will never pardon you and he went out	63.581485748291016
At the moment he went out a piercing glance darted through the opening of the nearly closed door and she perceived Felton who drew quickly to one side to prevent being seen by her	138.30738830566406
Then she threw herself upon her knees and began to pray	65.96105194091797
My God my God said she thou knowest in what holy cause I suffer give me then strength to suffer	268.6678466796875
The door opened gently the beautiful supplicant pretended not to hear the noise and in a voice broken by tears she continued	305.7205810546875
God of vengeance God of goodness wilt thou allow the frightful projects of this man to be accomplished	545.1929931640625
Then only she pretended to hear the sound of Feltons steps and rising quick as thought she blushed as if ashamed of being surprised on her knees	53.10357666015625
I do not like to disturb those who pray madame said Felton seriously do not disturb yourself on my account I beseech you	81.3791275024414
How do you know I was praying sir said Milady in a voice broken by sobs	92.94324493408203
You were deceived sir I was not praying	88.33697509765625
Do you think then madame replied Felton in the same serious voice but with a milder tone do you think I assume the right of preventing a creature from prostrating herself before her Creator God forbid Besides repentance becomes the guilty whatever crimes they may have committed for me the guilty are sacred at the feet of God	10.092782020568848
Guilty I said Milady with a smile which might have disarmed the angel of the last judgment	140.0121307373047
Guilty Oh my God thou knowest whether I am guilty Say I am condemned sir if you please but you know that God who loves martyrs sometimes permits the innocent to be condemned	525.7848510742188
Were you condemned were you innocent were you a martyr replied Felton the greater would be the necessity for prayer and I myself would aid you with my prayers	344.5771789550781
Oh you are a just man cried Milady throwing herself at his feet	684.3546142578125
I can hold out no longer for I fear I shall be wanting in strength at the moment when I shall be forced to undergo the struggle and confess my faith	155.5323944091797
Listen then to the supplication of a despairing woman	69.51949310302734
You are abused sir but that is not the question	113.07649993896484
I only ask you one favor and if you grant it me I will bless you in this world and in the next	266.0829162597656
Speak to the master madame said Felton happily I am neither charged with the power of pardoning nor punishing	361.47454833984375
It is upon one higher placed than I am that God has laid this responsibility	365.11358642578125
To youno to you alone Listen to me rather than add to my destruction rather than add to my ignominy	78.8958969116211
If you have merited this shame madame if you have incurred this ignominy you must submit to it as an offering to God	96.51245880126953
What do you say Oh you do not understand me When I speak of ignominy you think I speak of some chastisement of imprisonment or death	151.728515625
Would to heaven Of what consequence to me is imprisonment or death	73.18075561523438
It is I who no longer understand you madame said Felton	437.6998596191406
Or rather who pretend not to understand me sir replied the prisoner with a smile of incredulity	317.0060119628906
No madame on the honor of a soldier on the faith of a Christian	73.49083709716797
What you are ignorant of Lord de Winters designs upon me	432.1961975097656
I am	58.45230484008789
Impossible you are his confidant	297.48065185546875
I never lie madame	80.35816192626953
Oh he conceals them too little for you not to divine them	406.6214599609375
I seek to divine nothing madame I wait till I am confided in and apart from that which Lord de Winter has said to me before you he has confided nothing to me	103.31549072265625
Why then cried Milady with an incredible tone of truthfulness you are not his accomplice you do not know that he destines me to a disgrace which all the punishments of the world can not equal in horror	193.98101806640625
You are deceived madame said Felton blushing Lord de Winter is not capable of such a crime	206.45774841308594
Good said Milady to herself without thinking what it is he calls it a crime Then aloud The friend of that wretch is capable of everything	230.50384521484375
Whom do you call that wretch asked Felton	320.9121398925781
Are there then in England two men to whom such an epithet can be applied	200.45054626464844
You mean George Villiers asked Felton whose looks became excited	276.37744140625
Whom Pagans and unbelieving Gentiles call Duke of Buckingham replied Milady	327.42791748046875
I could not have thought that there was an Englishman in all England who would have required so long an explanation to make him understand of whom I was speaking	58.495155334472656
The hand of the Lord is stretched over him said Felton he will not escape the chastisement he deserves	126.60513305664062
Felton only expressed with regard to the duke the feeling of execration which all the English had declared toward him whom the Catholics themselves called the extortioner the pillager the debauchee and whom the Puritans styled simply Satan	120.96528625488281
Oh my God my God cried Milady when I supplicate thee to pour upon this man the chastisement which is his due thou knowest it is not my own vengeance I pursue but the deliverance of a whole nation that I implore	50.108741760253906
Do you know him then asked Felton	77.58515167236328
At length he interrogates me said Milady to herself at the height of joy at having obtained so quickly such a great result	121.74932861328125
Oh know him Yes yes to my misfortune to my eternal misfortune and Milady twisted her arms as if in a paroxysm of grief	104.55702209472656
Felton no doubt felt within himself that his strength was abandoning him and he made several steps toward the door but the prisoner whose eye never left him sprang in pursuit of him and stopped him	254.60549926757812
Sir cried she be kind be clement listen to my prayer That knife which the fatal prudence of the baron deprived me of because he knows the use I would make of it Oh hear me to the end that knife give it to me for a minute only for mercys for pitys sake I will embrace your knees You shall shut the door that you may be certain I contemplate no injury to you My God to youthe only just good and compassionate being I have met with To youmy preserver perhaps One minute that knife one minute a single minute and I will restore it to you through the grating of the door	276.219482421875
Only one minute Mr	173.15814208984375
Felton and you will have saved my honor	1219.2828369140625
To kill yourself cried Felton with terror forgetting to withdraw his hands from the hands of the prisoner to kill yourself	187.6064453125
I have told sir murmured Milady lowering her voice and allowing herself to sink overpowered to the ground I have told my secret He knows all My God I am lost	411.2012023925781
Felton remained standing motionless and undecided	310.67864990234375
He still doubts thought Milady I have not been earnest enough	51.03880310058594
Someone was heard in the corridor Milady recognized the step of Lord de Winter	230.46505737304688
Felton recognized it also and made a step toward the door	17.941452026367188
Milady sprang toward him	101.71742248535156
Oh not a word said she in a concentrated voice not a word of all that I have said to you to this man or I am lost and it would be youyou	239.0928497314453
Then as the steps drew near she became silent for fear of being heard applying with a gesture of infinite terror her beautiful hand to Feltons mouth	1162.363037109375
Felton gently repulsed Milady and she sank into a chair	164.8751983642578
Lord de Winter passed before the door without stopping and they heard the noise of his footsteps soon die away	88.61534118652344
Felton as pale as death remained some instants with his ear bent and listening then when the sound was quite extinct he breathed like a man awaking from a dream and rushed out of the apartment	211.8217010498047
Ah said Milady listening in her turn to the noise of Feltons steps which withdrew in a direction opposite to those of Lord de Winter at length you are mine	96.56852722167969
Then her brow darkened	75.63742065429688
If he tells the baron said she I am lostfor the baron who knows very well that I shall not kill myself will place me before him with a knife in my hand and he will discover that all this despair is but acted	10.922313690185547
She placed herself before the glass and regarded herself attentively never had she appeared more beautiful	29.540063858032227
Oh yes said she smiling but we wo nt tell him	208.30166625976562
In the evening Lord de Winter accompanied the supper	19.567230224609375
Sir said Milady is your presence an indispensable accessory of my captivity Could you not spare me the increase of torture which your visits cause me	25.185821533203125
How dear sister said Lord de Winter	370.39971923828125
Did not you sentimentally inform me with that pretty mouth of yours so cruel to me today that you came to England solely for the pleasure of seeing me at your ease an enjoyment of which you told me you so sensibly felt the deprivation that you had risked everything for itseasickness tempest captivity Well here I am be satisfied	78.91790771484375
Besides this time my visit has a motive	20755.806640625
Milady trembled she thought Felton had told all	105.15717315673828
Perhaps never in her life had this woman who had experienced so many opposite and powerful emotions felt her heart beat so violently	55.27172088623047
She was seated	82.09699249267578
Lord de Winter took a chair drew it toward her and sat down close beside her	323.248046875
Then taking a paper out of his pocket he unfolded it slowly	286.3523864746094
Here said he I want to show you the kind of passport which I have drawn up and which will serve you henceforward as the rule of order in the life I consent to leave you	115.38262939453125
Then turning his eyes from Milady to the paper he read Order to conduct The name is blank interrupted Lord de Winter	150.3993682861328
If you have any preference you can point it out to me and if it be not within a thousand leagues of London attention will be paid to your wishes	102.07950592041016
I will begin again then	305.59112548828125
Order to conduct tothe person named Charlotte Backson branded by the justice of the kingdom of France but liberated after chastisement	184.399658203125
She is to dwell in this place without ever going more than three leagues from it	73.42595672607422
In case of any attempt to escape the penalty of death is to be applied	191.57676696777344
She will receive five shillings per day for lodging and food	70.5906982421875
That order does not concern me replied Milady coldly since it bears another name than mine	341.06976318359375
A name Have you a name then	1033.1702880859375
I bear that of your brother	85.42473602294922
Ay but you are mistaken	148.43736267089844
My brother is only your second husband and your first is still living	388.36810302734375
Tell me his name and I will put it in the place of the name of Charlotte Backson	165.8233184814453
No You will not You are silent Well then you must be registered as Charlotte Backson	98.40116882324219
Milady remained silent only this time it was no longer from affectation but from terror	232.6276397705078
She believed the order ready for execution	46.15624237060547
She thought that Lord de Winter had hastened her departure she thought she was condemned to set off that very evening	56.91732406616211
Everything in her mind was lost for an instant when all at once she perceived that no signature was attached to the order	53.79043960571289
The joy she felt at this discovery was so great she could not conceal it	150.59759521484375
Yes yes said Lord de Winter who perceived what was passing in her mind yes you look for the signature and you say to yourself All is not lost for that order is not signed	369.16473388671875
It is only shown to me to terrify me that s all	23.36703872680664
You are mistaken	1167.432373046875
Tomorrow this order will be sent to the Duke of Buckingham	108.84415435791016
The day after tomorrow it will return signed by his hand and marked with his seal and fourandtwenty hours afterward I will answer for its being carried into execution	288.0579833984375
Adieu madame	587.3533325195312
That is all I had to say to you	1094.1719970703125
And I reply to you sir that this abuse of power this exile under a fictitious name are infamous	714.7529907226562
Would you like better to be hanged in your true name Milady You know that the English laws are inexorable on the abuse of marriage	2.000459671020508
Speak freely	297.04180908203125
Although my name or rather that of my brother would be mixed up with the affair I will risk the scandal of a public trial to make myself certain of getting rid of you	117.80172729492188
Milady made no reply but became as pale as a corpse	76.34010314941406
Oh I see you prefer peregrination	210.6183319091797
That s well madame and there is an old proverb that says Traveling trains youth	851.6106567382812
My faith you are not wrong after all and life is sweet	97.18081665039062
That s the reason why I take such care you shall not deprive me of mine	131.67129516601562
There only remains then the question of the five shillings to be settled	329.2745056152344
You think me rather parsimonious do nt you That s because I do nt care to leave you the means of corrupting your jailers	43.393798828125
Besides you will always have your charms left to seduce them with	176.59982299804688
Employ them if your check with regard to Felton has not disgusted you with attempts of that kind	108.3701400756836
Felton has not told him said Milady to herself	239.31903076171875
Nothing is lost then	19.329132080078125
And now madame till I see you again Tomorrow I will come and announce to you the departure of my messenger	102.81946563720703
Lord de Winter rose saluted her ironically and went out	30.01741600036621
Milady breathed again	1078.823974609375
She had still four days before her	6062.0107421875
Four days would quite suffice to complete the seduction of Felton	552.0484619140625
A terrible idea however rushed into her mind	284.9552917480469
She thought that Lord de Winter would perhaps send Felton himself to get the order signed by the Duke of Buckingham	110.96239471435547
In that case Felton would escape herfor in order to secure success the magic of a continuous seduction was necessary	300.22381591796875
Nevertheless as we have said one circumstance reassured her	80.0370101928711
Felton had not spoken	73.62151336669922
As she would not appear to be agitated by the threats of Lord de Winter she placed herself at the table and ate	159.91458129882812
Then as she had done the evening before she fell on her knees and repeated her prayers aloud	246.06346130371094
As on the evening before the soldier stopped his march to listen to her	123.41513061523438
Soon after she heard lighter steps than those of the sentinel which came from the end of the corridor and stopped before her door	162.77952575683594
It is he said she	87.81280517578125
And she began the same religious chant which had so strongly excited Felton the evening before	165.4116973876953
But although her voicesweet full and sonorousvibrated as harmoniously and as affectingly as ever the door remained shut	140.67068481445312
It appeared however to Milady that in one of the furtive glances she darted from time to time at the grating of the door she thought she saw the ardent eyes of the young man through the narrow opening	270.4773254394531
But whether this was reality or vision he had this time sufficient selfcommand not to enter	219.145263671875
However a few instants after she had finished her religious song Milady thought she heard a profound sigh	224.10670471191406
Then the same steps she had heard approach slowly withdrew as if with regret	83.18291473388672
Chapter LV	159.4865264892578
CAPTIVITY THE FOURTH DAY	59.500244140625
The next day when Felton entered Miladys apartment he found her standing mounted upon a chair holding in her hands a cord made by means of torn cambric handkerchiefs twisted into a kind of rope one with another and tied at the ends	137.4770050048828
At the noise Felton made in entering Milady leaped lightly to the ground and tried to conceal behind her the improvised cord she held in her hand	434.1031799316406
The young man was more pale than usual and his eyes reddened by want of sleep denoted that he had passed a feverish night	199.245849609375
Nevertheless his brow was armed with a severity more austere than ever	309.6763000488281
He advanced slowly toward Milady who had seated herself and taking an end of the murderous rope which by neglect or perhaps by design she allowed to be seen What is this madame he asked coldly	978.0874633789062
That Nothing said Milady smiling with that painful expression which she knew so well how to give to her smile	1576.6793212890625
Ennui is the mortal enemy of prisoners I had ennui and I amused myself with twisting that rope	916.4382934570312
Felton turned his eyes toward the part of the wall of the apartment before which he had found Milady standing in the armchair in which she was now seated and over her head he perceived a giltheaded screw fixed in the wall for the purpose of hanging up clothes or weapons	185.53875732421875
He started and the prisoner saw that startfor though her eyes were cast down nothing escaped her	529.5950927734375
What were you doing on that armchair asked he	82.97145080566406
Of what consequence replied Milady	56.412967681884766
But replied Felton I wish to know	78.22610473632812
Do not question me said the prisoner you know that we who are true Christians are forbidden to lie	151.3633575439453
Well then said Felton I will tell you what you were doing or rather what you meant to do you were going to complete the fatal project you cherish in your mind	357.27545166015625
Remember madame if our God forbids falsehood he much more severely condemns suicide	74.50988006591797
When God sees one of his creatures persecuted unjustly placed between suicide and dishonor believe me sir replied Milady in a tone of deep conviction God pardons suicide for then suicide becomes martyrdom	131.0841064453125
You say either too much or too little speak madame	229.12759399414062
In the name of heaven explain yourself	890.1754760742188
That I may relate my misfortunes for you to treat them as fables that I may tell you my projects for you to go and betray them to my persecutor No sir	60.92963790893555
Besides of what importance to you is the life or death of a condemned wretch You are only responsible for my body is it not so And provided you produce a carcass that may be recognized as mine they will require no more of you nay perhaps you will even have a double reward	219.47036743164062
I madame I cried Felton	151.21734619140625
You suppose that I would ever accept the price of your life Oh you can not believe what you say	4968.90576171875
Let me act as I please Felton let me act as I please said Milady elated	164.35540771484375
Every soldier must be ambitious must he not You are a lieutenant Well you will follow me to the grave with the rank of captain	380.70098876953125
What have I then done to you said Felton much agitated that you should load me with such a responsibility before God and before men In a few days you will be away from this place your life madame will then no longer be under my care and added he with a sigh then you can do what you will with it	372.05535888671875
So cried Milady as if she could not resist giving utterance to a holy indignation you a pious man you who are called a just man you ask but one thingand that is that you may not be inculpated annoyed by my death	198.22012329101562
It is my duty to watch over your life madame and I will watch	36.68541717529297
But do you understand the mission you are fulfilling Cruel enough if I am guilty but what name can you give it what name will the Lord give it if I am innocent	227.63836669921875
I am a soldier madame and fulfill the orders I have received	793.0030517578125
Do you believe then that at the day of the Last Judgment God will separate blind executioners from iniquitous judges You are not willing that I should kill my body and you make yourself the agent of him who would kill my soul	303.1654357910156
But I repeat it again to you replied Felton in great emotion no danger threatens you I will answer for Lord de Winter as for myself	60.044681549072266
Dunce cried Milady dunce who dares to answer for another man when the wisest when those most after Gods own heart hesitate to answer for themselves and who ranges himself on the side of the strongest and the most fortunate to crush the weakest and the most unfortunate	173.70396423339844
Impossible madame impossible murmured Felton who felt to the bottom of his heart the justness of this argument	168.00733947753906
A prisoner you will not recover your liberty through me living you will not lose your life through me	230.42713928222656
Yes cried Milady but I shall lose that which is much dearer to me than life I shall lose my honor Felton and it is you you whom I make responsible before God and before men for my shame and my infamy	84.92420196533203
This time Felton immovable as he was or appeared to be could not resist the secret influence which had already taken possession of him	542.1243896484375
To see this woman so beautiful fair as the brightest vision to see her by turns overcome with grief and threatening to resist at once the ascendancy of grief and beautyit was too much for a visionary it was too much for a brain weakened by the ardent dreams of an ecstatic faith it was too much for a heart furrowed by the love of heaven that burns by the hatred of men that devours	150.64456176757812
Milady saw the trouble	53.2313117980957
She felt by intuition the flame of the opposing passions which burned with the blood in the veins of the young fanatic	26.698747634887695
As a skillful general seeing the enemy ready to surrender marches toward him with a cry of victory she rose beautiful as an antique priestess inspired like a Christian virgin her arms extended her throat uncovered her hair disheveled holding with one hand her robe modestly drawn over her breast her look illumined by that fire which had already created such disorder in the veins of the young Puritan and went toward him crying out with a vehement air and in her melodious voice to which on this occasion she communicated a terrible energy	203.15208435058594
Let this victim to Baal be sent To the lions the martyr be thrown Thy God shall teach thee to repent From th abyss hell give ear to my moan	38.2601318359375
Felton stood before this strange apparition like one petrified	51.01396179199219
Who art thou Who art thou cried he clasping his hands	108.90873718261719
Art thou a messenger from God art thou a minister from hell art thou an angel or a demon callest thou thyself Eloa or Astarte	116.1445541381836
Do you not know me Felton I am neither an angel nor a demon I am a daughter of earth I am a sister of thy faith that is all	235.8067626953125
Yes yes said Felton I doubted but now I believe	31.436988830566406
You believe and still you are an accomplice of that child of Belial who is called Lord de Winter You believe and yet you leave me in the hands of mine enemies of the enemy of England of the enemy of God You believe and yet you deliver me up to him who fills and defiles the world with his heresies and debaucheriesto that infamous Sardanapalus whom the blind call the Duke of Buckingham and whom believers name Antichrist	162.3110809326172
I deliver you up to Buckingham I what mean you by that	40.16609573364258
They have eyes cried Milady but they see not ears have they but they hear not	344.1589660644531
Yes yes said Felton passing his hands over his brow covered with sweat as if to remove his last doubt	1854.5587158203125
Yes I recognize the voice which speaks to me in my dreams yes I recognize the features of the angel who appears to me every night crying to my soul which can not sleep Strike save England save thyselffor thou wilt die without having appeased God Speak speak cried Felton I can understand you now	2502.131591796875
A flash of terrible joy but rapid as thought gleamed from the eyes of Milady	24.441362380981445
However fugitive this homicide flash Felton saw it and started as if its light had revealed the abysses of this womans heart	489.3701171875
He recalled all at once the warnings of Lord de Winter the seductions of Milady her first attempts after her arrival	78.01913452148438
He drew back a step and hung down his head without however ceasing to look at her as if fascinated by this strange creature he could not detach his eyes from her eyes	1267.6461181640625
Milady was not a woman to misunderstand the meaning of this hesitation	54.92716979980469
Under her apparent emotions her icy coolness never abandoned her	73.15908813476562
Before Felton replied and before she should be forced to resume this conversation so difficult to be sustained in the same exalted tone she let her hands fall and as if the weakness of the woman overpowered the enthusiasm of the inspired fanatic she said But no it is not for me to be the Judith to deliver Bethulia from this Holofernes	154.42832946777344
The sword of the eternal is too heavy for my arm	217.44886779785156
Allow me then to avoid dishonor by death let me take refuge in martyrdom	139.17257690429688
I do not ask you for liberty as a guilty one would nor for vengeance as would a pagan	45.2546501159668
Let me die that is all	31.8304386138916
I supplicate you I implore you on my kneeslet me die and my last sigh shall be a blessing for my preserver	654.2643432617188
Hearing that voice so sweet and suppliant seeing that look so timid and downcast Felton reproached himself	53.859928131103516
By degrees the enchantress had clothed herself with that magic adornment which she assumed and threw aside at will that is to say beauty meekness and tearsand above all the irresistible attraction of mystical voluptuousness the most devouring of all voluptuousness	285.6304626464844
Alas said Felton I can do but one thing which is to pity you if you prove to me you are a victim But Lord de Winter makes cruel accusations against you	104.18684387207031
You are a Christian you are my sister in religion	113.9461441040039
I feel myself drawn toward youI who have never loved anyone but my benefactorI who have met with nothing but traitors and impious men	30.840314865112305
But you madame so beautiful in reality you so pure in appearance must have committed great iniquities for Lord de Winter to pursue you thus	50.08168029785156
They have eyes repeated Milady with an accent of indescribable grief but they see not ears have they but they hear not	71.7253189086914
But cried the young officer speak then speak	403.1119079589844
Confide my shame to you cried Milady with the blush of modesty upon her countenance for often the crime of one becomes the shame of anotherconfide my shame to you a man and I a woman Oh continued she placing her hand modestly over her beautiful eyes never neverI could not	114.27005004882812
To me to a brother said Felton	36.42134475708008
Milady looked at him for some time with an expression which the young man took for doubt but which however was nothing but observation or rather the wish to fascinate	1010.45849609375
Felton in his turn a suppliant clasped his hands	1633.2479248046875
Well then said Milady I confide in my brother I will dare to	233.88436889648438
At this moment the steps of Lord de Winter were heard but this time the terrible brotherinlaw of Milady did not content himself as on the preceding day with passing before the door and going away again	84.3351058959961
He paused exchanged two words with the sentinel then the door opened and he appeared	55.438621520996094
During the exchange of these two words Felton drew back quickly and when Lord de Winter entered he was several paces from the prisoner	74.16937255859375
The baron entered slowly sending a scrutinizing glance from Milady to the young officer	24.04435920715332
You have been here a very long time John said he	11.456551551818848
Has this woman been relating her crimes to you In that case I can comprehend the length of the conversation	260.59222412109375
Felton started and Milady felt she was lost if she did not come to the assistance of the disconcerted Puritan	142.8623504638672
Ah you fear your prisoner should escape said she	197.892333984375
Well ask your worthy jailer what favor I this instant solicited of him	232.570068359375
You demanded a favor said the baron suspiciously	84.70410919189453
Yes my Lord replied the young man confused	1294.6474609375
And what favor pray asked Lord de Winter	96.65900421142578
A knife which she would return to me through the grating of the door a minute after she had received it replied Felton	99.77286529541016
There is someone then concealed here whose throat this amiable lady is desirous of cutting said de Winter in an ironical contemptuous tone	100.54032897949219
There is myself replied Milady	74.98519897460938
I have given you the choice between America and Tyburn replied Lord de Winter	95.16993713378906
Choose Tyburn madame	40.973426818847656
Believe me the cord is more certain than the knife	77.5374755859375
Felton grew pale and made a step forward remembering that at the moment he entered Milady had a rope in her hand	93.36812591552734
You are right said she I have often thought of it	66.98234558105469
Then she added in a low voice And I will think of it again	29.00788688659668
Felton felt a shudder run to the marrow of his bones probably Lord de Winter perceived this emotion	358.36114501953125
Mistrust yourself John said he	18.191219329833984
I have placed reliance upon you my friend	348.6819763183594
Beware I have warned you But be of good courage my lad in three days we shall be delivered from this creature and where I shall send her she can harm nobody	38.08358383178711
You hear him cried Milady with vehemence so that the baron might believe she was addressing heaven and that Felton might understand she was addressing him	186.47866821289062
Felton lowered his head and reflected	94.12052917480469
The baron took the young officer by the arm and turned his head over his shoulder so as not to lose sight of Milady till he was gone out	128.62094116210938
Well said the prisoner when the door was shut I am not so far advanced as I believed	154.12420654296875
De Winter has changed his usual stupidity into a strange prudence	2.000459671020508
It is the desire of vengeance and how desire molds a man As to Felton he hesitates	124.15174865722656
Ah he is not a man like that cursed DArtagnan	1207.52001953125
A Puritan only adores virgins and he adores them by clasping his hands	246.6669464111328
A Musketeer loves women and he loves them by clasping his arms round them	142.4013671875
Milady waited then with much impatience for she feared the day would pass away without her seeing Felton again	364.275390625
At last in an hour after the scene we have just described she heard someone speaking in a low voice at the door	235.19947814941406
Presently the door opened and she perceived Felton	2244.5224609375
The young man advanced rapidly into the chamber leaving the door open behind him and making a sign to Milady to be silent his face was much agitated	136.9964141845703
What do you want with me said she	859.201416015625
Listen replied Felton in a low voice	808.1563720703125
I have just sent away the sentinel that I might remain here without anybody knowing it in order to speak to you without being overheard	197.91761779785156
The baron has just related a frightful story to me	140.99356079101562
Milady assumed her smile of a resigned victim and shook her head	162.13194274902344
Either you are a demon continued Felton or the baronmy benefactor my fatheris a monster	556.3453369140625
I have known you four days I have loved him four years	537.2731323242188
I therefore may hesitate between you	2015.22607421875
Be not alarmed at what I say I want to be convinced	775.9207153320312
Tonight after twelve I will come and see you and you shall convince me	230.95889282226562
No Felton no my brother said she the sacrifice is too great and I feel what it must cost you	2860.375732421875
No I am lost do not be lost with me	81.64405822753906
My death will be much more eloquent than my life and the silence of the corpse will convince you much better than the words of the prisoner	369.7445068359375
Be silent madame cried Felton and do not speak to me thus I came to entreat you to promise me upon your honor to swear to me by what you hold most sacred that you will make no attempt upon your life	351.7200012207031
I will not promise said Milady for no one has more respect for a promise or an oath than I have and if I make a promise I must keep it	68.21876525878906
Well said Felton only promise till you have seen me again	4299.02783203125
If when you have seen me again you still persistwell then you shall be free and I myself will give you the weapon you desire	432.7498779296875
Well said Milady for you I will wait	193.12399291992188
I swear it by our God	118.82652282714844
Are you satisfied	146.37806701660156
Well said Felton till tonight	99.31423950195312
And he darted out of the room shut the door and waited in the corridor the soldiers halfpike in his hand and as if he had mounted guard in his place	37.86285400390625
The soldier returned and Felton gave him back his weapon	393.85101318359375
Then through the grating to which she had drawn near Milady saw the young man make a sign with delirious fervor and depart in an apparent transport of joy	93.77410888671875
As for her she returned to her place with a smile of savage contempt upon her lips and repeated blaspheming that terrible name of God by whom she had just sworn without ever having learned to know Him	144.4189910888672
My God said she what a senseless fanatic My God it is IIand this fellow who will help me to avenge myself	75.55522918701172
Chapter LVI	281.05535888671875
CAPTIVITY THE FIFTH DAY	150.86962890625
Milady had however achieved a halftriumph and success doubled her forces	576.5061645507812
It was not difficult to conquer as she had hitherto done men prompt to let themselves be seduced and whom the gallant education of a court led quickly into her net	27.73963737487793
Milady was handsome enough not to find much resistance on the part of the flesh and she was sufficiently skillful to prevail over all the obstacles of the mind	280.50177001953125
But this time she had to contend with an unpolished nature concentrated and insensible by force of austerity	19.742225646972656
Religion and its observances had made Felton a man inaccessible to ordinary seductions	388.394775390625
There fermented in that sublimated brain plans so vast projects so tumultuous that there remained no room for any capricious or material lovethat sentiment which is fed by leisure and grows with corruption	36.50507354736328
Milady had then made a breach by her false virtue in the opinion of a man horribly prejudiced against her and by her beauty in the heart of a man hitherto chaste and pure	267.4225769042969
In short she had taken the measure of motives hitherto unknown to herself through this experiment made upon the most rebellious subject that nature and religion could submit to her study	79.2313232421875
Many a time nevertheless during the evening she despaired of fate and of herself	371.6815490722656
She did not invoke God we very well know but she had faith in the genius of evilthat immense sovereignty which reigns in all the details of human life and by which as in the Arabian fable a single pomegranate seed is sufficient to reconstruct a ruined world	151.77163696289062
Milady being well prepared for the reception of Felton was able to erect her batteries for the next day	129.04835510253906
She knew she had only two days left that when once the order was signed by Buckinghamand Buckingham would sign it the more readily from its bearing a false name and he could not therefore recognize the woman in questiononce this order was signed we say the baron would make her embark immediately and she knew very well that women condemned to exile employ arms much less powerful in their seductions than the pretendedly virtuous woman whose beauty is lighted by the sun of the world whose style the voice of fashion lauds and whom a halo of aristocracy gilds with enchanting splendors	492.2210388183594
To be a woman condemned to a painful and disgraceful punishment is no impediment to beauty but it is an obstacle to the recovery of power	179.63670349121094
Like all persons of real genius Milady knew what suited her nature and her means	161.84173583984375
Poverty was repugnant to her degradation took away twothirds of her greatness	1812.041015625
Milady was only a queen while among queens	157.0122833251953
The pleasure of satisfied pride was necessary to her domination	397.9615173339844
To command inferior beings was rather a humiliation than a pleasure for her	992.7613525390625
She should certainly return from her exileshe did not doubt that a single instant but how long might this exile last For an active ambitious nature like that of Milady days not spent in climbing are inauspicious days	82.80525207519531
What word then can be found to describe the days which they occupy in descending To lose a year two years three years is to talk of an eternity to return after the death or disgrace of the cardinal perhaps to return when DArtagnan and his friends happy and triumphant should have received from the queen the reward they had well acquired by the services they had rendered herthese were devouring ideas that a woman like Milady could not endure	42.40068054199219
For the rest the storm which raged within her doubled her strength and she would have burst the walls of her prison if her body had been able to take for a single instant the proportions of her mind	283.02532958984375
Then that which spurred her on additionally in the midst of all this was the remembrance of the cardinal	78.43194580078125
What must the mistrustful restless suspicious cardinal think of her silencethe cardinal not merely her only support her only prop her only protector at present but still further the principal instrument of her future fortune and vengeance She knew him she knew that at her return from a fruitless journey it would be in vain to tell him of her imprisonment in vain to enlarge upon the sufferings she had undergone	142.15469360351562
The cardinal would reply with the sarcastic calmness of the skeptic strong at once by power and genius You should not have allowed yourself to be taken	29.180294036865234
Then Milady collected all her energies murmuring in the depths of her soul the name of Feltonthe only beam of light that penetrated to her in the hell into which she had fallen and like a serpent which folds and unfolds its rings to ascertain its strength she enveloped Felton beforehand in the thousand meshes of her inventive imagination	908.9462280273438
Time however passed away the hours one after another seemed to awaken the clock as they passed and every blow of the brass hammer resounded upon the heart of the prisoner	94.88876342773438
At nine oclock Lord de Winter made his customary visit examined the window and the bars sounded the floor and the walls looked to the chimney and the doors without during this long and minute examination he or Milady pronouncing a single word	82.43193817138672
Doubtless both of them understood that the situation had become too serious to lose time in useless words and aimless wrath	215.8425750732422
Well said the baron on leaving her you will not escape tonight	47.21857452392578
At ten oclock Felton came and placed the sentinel	17.88372039794922
Milady recognized his step	36.73997497558594
She was as well acquainted with it now as a mistress is with that of the lover of her heart and yet Milady at the same time detested and despised this weak fanatic	73.15337371826172
That was not the appointed hour	57.81068801879883
Felton did not enter	10.243911743164062
Two hours after as midnight sounded the sentinel was relieved	88.40603637695312
This time it was the hour and from this moment Milady waited with impatience	63.118492126464844
The new sentinel commenced his walk in the corridor	183.35459899902344
At the expiration of ten minutes Felton came	342.9456787109375
Milady was all attention	138.59828186035156
Listen said the young man to the sentinel	34.85077667236328
On no pretense leave the door for you know that last night my Lord punished a soldier for having quit his post for an instant although I during his absence watched in his place	75.30378723144531
Yes I know it said the soldier	34.887977600097656
I recommend you therefore to keep the strictest watch	70.9429931640625
For my part I am going to pay a second visit to this woman who I fear entertains sinister intentions upon her own life and I have received orders to watch her	846.9987182617188
Good murmured Milady the austere Puritan lies	389.48956298828125
As to the soldier he only smiled	222.4752197265625
Zounds Lieutenant said he you are not unlucky in being charged with such commissions particularly if my Lord has authorized you to look into her bed	885.7237548828125
Felton blushed	27123824.0
Under any other circumstances he would have reprimanded the soldier for indulging in such pleasantry but his conscience murmured too loud for his mouth to dare speak	434.6736145019531
If I call come said he	725.185302734375
If anyone comes call me	265.93817138671875
I will Lieutenant said the soldier	61.36454772949219
Felton entered Miladys apartment	154.575439453125
Milady arose	709.0886840820312
You are here said she	1669.54931640625
I promised to come said Felton and I have come	221.1779022216797
You promised me something else	344.86517333984375
What my God said the young man who in spite of his selfcommand felt his knees tremble and the sweat start from his brow	41961.8828125
You promised to bring a knife and to leave it with me after our interview	218.8068389892578
Say no more of that madame said Felton	280.7859802246094
There is no situation however terrible it may be which can authorize a creature of God to inflict death upon himself	156.39671325683594
I have reflected and I can not must not be guilty of such a sin	117.12305450439453
Ah you have reflected said the prisoner sitting down in her armchair with a smile of disdain and I also have reflected	2773.645751953125
Upon what	258.861083984375
That I can have nothing to say to a man who does not keep his word	458.03253173828125
Oh my God murmured Felton	787.5115966796875
You may retire said Milady	297.2861022949219
I will not talk	446.7358093261719
Here is the knife said Felton drawing from his pocket the weapon which he had brought according to his promise but which he hesitated to give to his prisoner	154.53189086914062
Let me see it said Milady	959.7735595703125
For what purpose	164.07383728027344
Upon my honor I will instantly return it to you	54.60252380371094
You shall place it on that table and you may remain between it and me	300.9951477050781
Felton offered the weapon to Milady who examined the temper of it attentively and who tried the point on the tip of her finger	517.2067260742188
Well said she returning the knife to the young officer this is fine and good steel	229.31405639648438
You are a faithful friend Felton	203970.9375
Felton took back the weapon and laid it upon the table as he had agreed with the prisoner	1283.3099365234375
Milady followed him with her eyes and made a gesture of satisfaction	560.208740234375
Now said she listen to me	62.405216217041016
The request was needless	99.43128204345703
The young officer stood upright before her awaiting her words as if to devour them	88.16923522949219
Felton said Milady with a solemnity full of melancholy imagine that your sister the daughter of your father speaks to you	1368.875
While yet young unfortunately handsome I was dragged into a snare	102.31517028808594
I resisted	132.47134399414062
Ambushes and violences multiplied around me but I resisted	69.91796112060547
The religion I serve the God I adore were blasphemed because I called upon that religion and that God but still I resisted	252.0140380859375
Then outrages were heaped upon me and as my soul was not subdued they wished to defile my body forever	81.1307373046875
Milady stopped and a bitter smile passed over her lips	651.0181274414062
Finally said Felton finally what did they do	87.1399154663086
At length one evening my enemy resolved to paralyze the resistance he could not conquer	167.5963897705078
One evening he mixed a powerful narcotic with my water	279.9536437988281
Scarcely had I finished my repast when I felt myself sink by degrees into a strange torpor	272.3832702636719
Although I was without mistrust a vague fear seized me and I tried to struggle against sleepiness	171.1944122314453
I arose	522.7779541015625
I wished to run to the window and call for help but my legs refused their office	621.2138671875
It appeared as if the ceiling sank upon my head and crushed me with its weight	276.144287109375
I stretched out my arms	13.211291313171387
I tried to speak	132.7217254638672
I could only utter inarticulate sounds and irresistible faintness came over me	704.5185546875
I supported myself by a chair feeling that I was about to fall but this support was soon insufficient on account of my weak arms	529.4981689453125
I fell upon one knee then upon both	196.90625
I tried to pray but my tongue was frozen	201.5821990966797
God doubtless neither heard nor saw me and I sank upon the floor a prey to a slumber which resembled death	161.82305908203125
Of all that passed in that sleep or the time which glided away while it lasted I have no remembrance	148.41131591796875
The only thing I recollect is that I awoke in bed in a round chamber the furniture of which was sumptuous and into which light only penetrated by an opening in the ceiling	405.4908752441406
No door gave entrance to the room	162.174072265625
It might be called a magnificent prison	49.35698699951172
It was a long time before I was able to make out what place I was in or to take account of the details I describe	118.79122924804688
My mind appeared to strive in vain to shake off the heavy darkness of the sleep from which I could not rouse myself	455.7424011230469
I had vague perceptions of space traversed of the rolling of a carriage of a horrible dream in which my strength had become exhausted but all this was so dark and so indistinct in my mind that these events seemed to belong to another life than mine and yet mixed with mine in fantastic duality	533.1119384765625
At times the state into which I had fallen appeared so strange that I believed myself dreaming	215.97952270507812
I arose trembling	46.5311279296875
My clothes were near me on a chair I neither remembered having undressed myself nor going to bed	97.40127563476562
Then by degrees the reality broke upon me full of chaste terrors	195.7589569091797
I was no longer in the house where I had dwelt	79.67610168457031
As well as I could judge by the light of the sun the day was already twothirds gone	163.4207763671875
It was the evening before when I had fallen asleep my sleep then must have lasted twentyfour hours What had taken place during this long sleep	274.0845642089844
I dressed myself as quickly as possible my slow and stiff motions all attested that the effects of the narcotic were not yet entirely dissipated	140.28945922851562
The chamber was evidently furnished for the reception of a woman and the most finished coquette could not have formed a wish but on casting her eyes about the apartment she would have found that wish accomplished	242.92576599121094
Certainly I was not the first captive that had been shut up in this splendid prison but you may easily comprehend Felton that the more superb the prison the greater was my terror	268.7984313964844
Yes it was a prison for I tried in vain to get out of it	362.2344055175781
I sounded all the walls in the hopes of discovering a door but everywhere the walls returned a full and flat sound	59.38972091674805
I made the tour of the room at least twenty times in search of an outlet of some kind but there was none	423.37640380859375
I sank exhausted with fatigue and terror into an armchair	1241.2061767578125
Meantime night came on rapidly and with night my terrors increased	182.2642822265625
I did not know but I had better remain where I was seated	280.95623779296875
It appeared that I was surrounded with unknown dangers into which I was about to fall at every instant	438.9999694824219
Although I had eaten nothing since the evening before my fears prevented my feeling hunger	413.5989074707031
No noise from without by which I could measure the time reached me I only supposed it must be seven or eight oclock in the evening for it was in the month of October and it was quite dark	228.7115936279297
All at once the noise of a door turning on its hinges made me start	324.4802551269531
A globe of fire appeared above the glazed opening of the ceiling casting a strong light into my chamber and I perceived with terror that a man was standing within a few paces of me	145.4305419921875
A table with two covers bearing a supper ready prepared stood as if by magic in the middle of the apartment	1287.0419921875
That man was he who had pursued me during a whole year who had vowed my dishonor and who by the first words that issued from his mouth gave me to understand he had accomplished it the preceding night	154.2933349609375
Scoundrel murmured Felton	1648.861328125
Oh yes scoundrel cried Milady seeing the interest which the young officer whose soul seemed to hang on her lips took in this strange recital	401.7872009277344
Oh yes scoundrel He believed having triumphed over me in my sleep that all was completed	375.27337646484375
He came hoping that I would accept my shame as my shame was consummated he came to offer his fortune in exchange for my love	688.6209106445312
All that the heart of a woman could contain of haughty contempt and disdainful words I poured out upon this man	76.62430572509766
Doubtless he was accustomed to such reproaches for he listened to me calm and smiling with his arms crossed over his breast	307.390625
Then when he thought I had said all he advanced toward me I sprang toward the table I seized a knife I placed it to my breast	110.94499206542969
Take one step more said I and in addition to my dishonor you shall have my death to reproach yourself with	298.418212890625
There was no doubt in my look my voice my whole person that sincerity of gesture of attitude of accent which carries conviction to the most perverse minds for he paused	322.685791015625
Your death said he oh no you are too charming a mistress to allow me to consent to lose you thus after I have had the happiness to possess you only a single time	50.27814865112305
Adieu my charmer I will wait to pay you my next visit till you are in a better humor	242.24200439453125
At these words he blew a whistle the globe of fire which lighted the room reascended and disappeared	240.8512420654297
I found myself again in complete darkness	134.66287231445312
The same noise of a door opening and shutting was repeated the instant afterward the flaming globe descended afresh and I was completely alone	282.33843994140625
This moment was frightful if I had any doubts as to my misfortune these doubts had vanished in an overwhelming reality	72.29159545898438
I was in the power of a man whom I not only detested but despisedof a man capable of anything and who had already given me a fatal proof of what he was able to do	244.06675720214844
But who then was this man asked Felton	565.0517578125
I passed the night on a chair starting at the least noise for toward midnight the lamp went out and I was again in darkness	107.7619400024414
But the night passed away without any fresh attempt on the part of my persecutor	235.71481323242188
Day came the table had disappeared only I had still the knife in my hand	108.10830688476562
This knife was my only hope	313.6902160644531
I was worn out with fatigue	1061.9986572265625
Sleeplessness inflamed my eyes I had not dared to sleep a single instant	192.7205047607422
The light of day reassured me I went and threw myself on the bed without parting with the emancipating knife which I concealed under my pillow	1561.1195068359375
When I awoke a fresh meal was served	412.56732177734375
This time in spite of my terrors in spite of my agony I began to feel a devouring hunger	322.99737548828125
It was fortyeight hours since I had taken any nourishment	266.2862243652344
I ate some bread and some fruit then remembering the narcotic mixed with the water I had drunk I would not touch that which was placed on the table but filled my glass at a marble fountain fixed in the wall over my dressing table	22.40546989440918
And yet notwithstanding these precautions I remained for some time in a terrible agitation of mind	67.78274536132812
But my fears were this time illfounded I passed the day without experiencing anything of the kind I dreaded	203.66526794433594
I took the precaution to half empty the carafe in order that my suspicions might not be noticed	4.351946830749512
The evening came on and with it darkness but however profound was this darkness my eyes began to accustom themselves to it	201.85296630859375
I saw amid the shadows the table sink through the floor a quarter of an hour later it reappeared bearing my supper	45.2155876159668
In an instant thanks to the lamp my chamber was once more lighted	57.287330627441406
I was determined to eat only such things as could not possibly have anything soporific introduced into them	161.9154510498047
Two eggs and some fruit composed my repast then I drew another glass of water from my protecting fountain and drank it	61.025184631347656
At the first swallow it appeared to me not to have the same taste as in the morning	90.7077407836914
Suspicion instantly seized me	26.59963035583496
I paused but I had already drunk half a glass	118.97286224365234
I threw the rest away with horror and waited with the dew of fear upon my brow	479.1267395019531
No doubt some invisible witness had seen me draw the water from that fountain and had taken advantage of my confidence in it the better to assure my ruin so coolly resolved upon so cruelly pursued	204.0631561279297
Half an hour had not passed when the same symptoms began to appear but as I had only drunk half a glass of the water I contended longer and instead of falling entirely asleep I sank into a state of drowsiness which left me a perception of what was passing around me while depriving me of the strength either to defend myself or to fly	254.47479248046875
I dragged myself toward the bed to seek the only defense I had leftmy saving knife but I could not reach the bolster	231.5888214111328
I sank on my knees my hands clasped round one of the bedposts then I felt that I was lost	98.18598937988281
Felton became frightfully pale and a convulsive tremor crept through his whole body	274.6820983886719
And what was most frightful continued Milady her voice altered as if she still experienced the same agony as at that awful minute was that at this time I retained a consciousness of the danger that threatened me was that my soul if I may say so waked in my sleeping body was that I saw that I heard	33.789405822753906
It is true that all was like a dream but it was not the less frightful	1071.823974609375
I saw the lamp ascend and leave me in darkness then I heard the wellknown creaking of the door although I had heard that door open but twice	256.61328125
I felt instinctively that someone approached me it is said that the doomed wretch in the deserts of America thus feels the approach of the serpent	58.03518295288086
I wished to make an effort I attempted to cry out	3880.556640625
By an incredible effort of will I even raised myself up but only to sink down again immediately and to fall into the arms of my persecutor	134.38441467285156
Tell me who this man was cried the young officer	506.6946716308594
Milady saw at a single glance all the painful feelings she inspired in Felton by dwelling on every detail of her recital but she would not spare him a single pang	363.32769775390625
The more profoundly she wounded his heart the more certainly he would avenge her	194.77468872070312
She continued then as if she had not heard his exclamation or as if she thought the moment was not yet come to reply to it	1168.683837890625
Only this time it was no longer an inert body without feeling that the villain had to deal with	69.72156524658203
I have told you that without being able to regain the complete exercise of my faculties I retained the sense of my danger	176.76116943359375
I struggled then with all my strength and doubtless opposed weak as I was a long resistance for I heard him cry out These miserable Puritans I knew very well that they tired out their executioners but I did not believe them so strong against their lovers	91.19407653808594
Alas this desperate resistance could not last long	847.9277954101562
I felt my strength fail and this time it was not my sleep that enabled the coward to prevail but my swoon	112.42633819580078
Felton listened without uttering any word or sound except an inward expression of agony	100.45986938476562
The sweat streamed down his marble forehead and his hand under his coat tore his breast	169.42575073242188
My first impulse on coming to myself was to feel under my pillow for the knife I had not been able to reach if it had not been useful for defense it might at least serve for expiation	146.607666015625
But on taking this knife Felton a terrible idea occurred to me	701.464111328125
I have sworn to tell you all and I will tell you all	178.0703887939453
I have promised you the truth I will tell it were it to destroy me	184.9285125732422
The idea came into your mind to avenge yourself on this man did it not cried Felton	693.7951049804688
Yes said Milady	80.9281997680664
The idea was not that of a Christian I knew but without doubt that eternal enemy of our souls that lion roaring constantly around us breathed it into my mind	124.58460235595703
In short what shall I say to you Felton continued Milady in the tone of a woman accusing herself of a crime	36.251068115234375
This idea occurred to me and did not leave me it is of this homicidal thought that I now bear the punishment	82.90864562988281
Continue continue said Felton I am eager to see you attain your vengeance	183.67813110351562
Oh I resolved that it should take place as soon as possible	179.7751922607422
I had no doubt he would return the following night	96.69782257080078
During the day I had nothing to fear	418.3477783203125
When the hour of breakfast came therefore I did not hesitate to eat and drink	574.6930541992188
I had determined to make believe sup but to eat nothing	498.0958557128906
I was forced then to combat the fast of the evening with the nourishment of the morning	275.30126953125
Only I concealed a glass of water which remained after my breakfast thirst having been the chief of my sufferings when I remained fortyeight hours without eating or drinking	472.2393493652344
The day passed away without having any other influence on me than to strengthen the resolution I had formed only I took care that my face should not betray the thoughts of my heart for I had no doubt I was watched	75.2371597290039
Several times even I felt a smile on my lips	83.38640594482422
Felton I dare not tell you at what idea I smiled you would hold me in horror	119.7994384765625
Go on go on said Felton you see plainly that I listen and that I am anxious to know the end	88.95809173583984
Evening came the ordinary events took place	254.54518127441406
During the darkness as before my supper was brought	437.04541015625
Then the lamp was lighted and I sat down to table	62.97079849243164
I only ate some fruit	94.31470489501953
I pretended to pour out water from the jug but I only drank that which I had saved in my glass	17.16653060913086
The substitution was made so carefully that my spies if I had any could have no suspicion of it	111.50802612304688
After supper I exhibited the same marks of languor as on the preceding evening but this time as I yielded to fatigue or as if I had become familiarized with danger I dragged myself toward my bed let my robe fall and lay down	252.19976806640625
I found my knife where I had placed it under my pillow and while feigning to sleep my hand grasped the handle of it convulsively	404.0236511230469
Two hours passed away without anything fresh happening	109.98359680175781
Oh my God who could have said so the evening before I began to fear that he would not come	38.431854248046875
At length I saw the lamp rise softly and disappear in the depths of the ceiling my chamber was filled with darkness and obscurity but I made a strong effort to penetrate this darkness and obscurity	255.80953979492188
Nearly ten minutes passed I heard no other noise but the beating of my own heart	111.8112564086914
I implored heaven that he might come	174.74949645996094
At length I heard the wellknown noise of the door which opened and shut I heard notwithstanding the thickness of the carpet a step which made the floor creak I saw notwithstanding the darkness a shadow which approached my bed	246.8959503173828
Haste haste said Felton do you not see that each of your words burns me like molten lead	148.38804626464844
Then continued Milady then I collected all my strength I recalled to my mind that the moment of vengeance or rather of justice had struck	133.19772338867188
I looked upon myself as another Judith I gathered myself up my knife in my hand and when I saw him near me stretching out his arms to find his victim then with the last cry of agony and despair I struck him in the middle of his breast	108.62540435791016
The miserable villain He had foreseen all	199.59188842773438
His breast was covered with a coatofmail the knife was bent against it	340.3570251464844
Ah ah cried he seizing my arm and wresting from me the weapon that had so badly served me you want to take my life do you my pretty Puritan But that s more than dislike that s ingratitude Come come calm yourself my sweet girl I thought you had softened	130.58209228515625
I am not one of those tyrants who detain women by force	236.66705322265625
You do nt love me	70.0949478149414
With my usual fatuity I doubted it now I am convinced	117.25464630126953
Tomorrow you shall be free	141.76736450195312
I had but one wish that was that he should kill me	151.71563720703125
Beware said I for my liberty is your dishonor	10.646718978881836
Explain yourself my pretty sibyl	171.25540161132812
Yes for as soon as I leave this place I will tell everything	2426.0361328125
I will proclaim the violence you have used toward me	363.4456787109375
I will describe my captivity	146037.921875
I will denounce this place of infamy	1752.9246826171875
You are placed on high my Lord but tremble Above you there is the king above the king there is God	92.03742980957031
However perfect master he was over himself my persecutor allowed a movement of anger to escape him	61.96240234375
I could not see the expression of his countenance but I felt the arm tremble upon which my hand was placed	111.80357360839844
Then you shall not leave this place said he	180.00250244140625
Very well cried I then the place of my punishment will be that of my tomb	47.30396270751953
I will die here and you will see if a phantom that accuses is not more terrible than a living being that threatens	432.2260437011719
You shall have no weapon left in your power	616.5065307617188
There is a weapon which despair has placed within the reach of every creature who has the courage to use it	222.71572875976562
I will allow myself to die with hunger	2.000459671020508
Come said the wretch is not peace much better than such a war as that I will restore you to liberty this moment I will proclaim you a piece of immaculate virtue I will name you the Lucretia of England	1308.86376953125
And I will say that you are the Sextus	146.19215393066406
I will denounce you before men as I have denounced you before God and if it be necessary that like Lucretia I should sign my accusation with my blood I will sign it	148.5684356689453
Ah said my enemy in a jeering tone that s quite another thing	14491.0771484375
My faith everything considered you are very well off here	1961.91064453125
You shall want for nothing and if you let yourself die of hunger that will be your own fault	274.258056640625
At these words he retired	46.815086364746094
I heard the door open and shut and I remained overwhelmed less I confess it by my grief than by the mortification of not having avenged myself	1055.9512939453125
He kept his word	48.72004699707031
All the day all the next night passed away without my seeing him again	315.5602722167969
But I also kept my word with him and I neither ate nor drank	90.89791107177734
I was as I told him resolved to die of hunger	78.44290161132812
I passed the day and the night in prayer for I hoped that God would pardon me my suicide	136.662353515625
The second night the door opened I was lying on the floor for my strength began to abandon me	56.37599563598633
At the noise I raised myself up on one hand	180.40635681152344
Well said a voice which vibrated in too terrible a manner in my ear not to be recognized well Are we softened a little Will we not pay for our liberty with a single promise of silence Come I am a good sort of a prince added he and although I like not Puritans I do them justice and it is the same with Puritanesses when they are pretty	71.27035522460938
Come take a little oath for me on the cross I wo nt ask anything more of you	40.83330154418945
On the cross cried I rising for at that abhorred voice I had recovered all my strength on the cross I swear that no promise no menace no force no torture shall close my mouth On the cross I swear to denounce you everywhere as a murderer as a thief of honor as a base coward On the cross I swear if I ever leave this place to call down vengeance upon you from the whole human race	233.7855682373047
Beware said the voice in a threatening accent that I had never yet heard	84.97422790527344
I have an extraordinary means which I will not employ but in the last extremity to close your mouth or at least to prevent anyone from believing a word you may utter	511.3961181640625
I mustered all my strength to reply to him with a burst of laughter	71.01287841796875
He saw that it was a merciless war between usa war to the death	374.2811584472656
Listen said he	54.2286262512207
I give you the rest of tonight and all day tomorrow	141.88604736328125
Reflect promise to be silent and riches consideration even honor shall surround you threaten to speak and I will condemn you to infamy	207.71519470214844
You cried I	328.9234313964844
To interminable ineffaceable infamy	758.7955932617188
You repeated I	634.903564453125
Oh I declare to you Felton I thought him mad	37.578670501708984
Yes yes I replied he	391.9313049316406
Oh leave me said I	5153.43408203125
Begone if you do not desire to see me dash my head against that wall before your eyes	158.31475830078125
Very well it is your own doing	269.6484069824219
Till tomorrow evening then	230.34518432617188
Till tomorrow evening then replied I allowing myself to fall and biting the carpet with rage	570.770751953125
Felton leaned for support upon a piece of furniture and Milady saw with the joy of a demon that his strength would fail him perhaps before the end of her recital	53.47832107543945
Chapter LVII	943.9821166992188
MEANS FOR CLASSICAL TRAGEDY	228.73155212402344
After a moment of silence employed by Milady in observing the young man who listened to her Milady continued her recital	170.38694763183594
It was nearly three days since I had eaten or drunk anything	455.3031921386719
I suffered frightful torments	120.89378356933594
At times there passed before me clouds which pressed my brow which veiled my eyes this was delirium	142.00477600097656
When the evening came I was so weak that every time I fainted I thanked God for I thought I was about to die	432.2691650390625
In the midst of one of these swoons I heard the door open	246.98484802246094
Terror recalled me to myself	159.54061889648438
He entered the apartment followed by a man in a mask	74.8452377319336
He was masked likewise but I knew his step I knew his voice I knew him by that imposing bearing which hell has bestowed upon his person for the curse of humanity	73.00554656982422
Well said he to me have you made your mind up to take the oath I requested of you	316.864990234375
You have said Puritans have but one word	1344.9248046875
Mine you have heard and that is to pursue youon earth to the tribunal of men in heaven to the tribunal of God	454.6207275390625
You persist then	218.2392578125
I swear it before the God who hears me	41362.76953125
I will take the whole world as a witness of your crime and that until I have found an avenger	1331.97607421875
You are a prostitute said he in a voice of thunder and you shall undergo the punishment of prostitutes Branded in the eyes of the world you invoke try to prove to that world that you are neither guilty nor mad	99.30960845947266
Then addressing the man who accompanied him Executioner said he do your duty	887.0750122070312
Oh his name his name cried Felton	285.45562744140625
His name tell it me	267.2372131347656
Then in spite of my cries in spite of my resistancefor I began to comprehend that there was a question of something worse than deaththe executioner seized me threw me on the floor fastened me with his bonds and suffocated by sobs almost without sense invoking God who did not listen to me I uttered all at once a frightful cry of pain and shame	797.7232666015625
A burning fire a redhot iron the iron of the executioner was imprinted on my shoulder	102.4234390258789
Felton uttered a groan	113.03773498535156
Here said Milady rising with the majesty of a queen here Felton behold the new martyrdom invented for a pure young girl the victim of the brutality of a villain	150.7161102294922
Learn to know the heart of men and henceforth make yourself less easily the instrument of their unjust vengeance	36.83219909667969
Milady with a rapid gesture opened her robe tore the cambric that covered her bosom and red with feigned anger and simulated shame showed the young man the ineffaceable impression which dishonored that beautiful shoulder	172.06576538085938
But cried Felton that is a fleurdelis which I see there	176.6523895263672
And therein consisted the infamy replied Milady	85.31331634521484
The brand of Englandit would be necessary to prove what tribunal had imposed it on me and I could have made a public appeal to all the tribunals of the kingdom but the brand of Franceoh by that by that I was branded indeed	29603.71875
This was too much for Felton	123.5063705444336
Pale motionless overwhelmed by this frightful revelation dazzled by the superhuman beauty of this woman who unveiled herself before him with an immodesty which appeared to him sublime he ended by falling on his knees before her as the early Christians did before those pure and holy martyrs whom the persecution of the emperors gave up in the circus to the sanguinary sensuality of the populace	13.94151782989502
The brand disappeared the beauty alone remained	56.60438919067383
Pardon Pardon cried Felton oh pardon	246.65353393554688
Milady read in his eyes love love	345.8895263671875
Pardon for what asked she	974.6339721679688
Pardon me for having joined with your persecutors	352.3901672363281
Milady held out her hand to him	187.91856384277344
So beautiful so young cried Felton covering that hand with his kisses	354.69635009765625
Milady let one of those looks fall upon him which make a slave of a king	176.52682495117188
Felton was a Puritan he abandoned the hand of this woman to kiss her feet	51.93204116821289
He no longer loved her he adored her	54.99759292602539
When this crisis was past when Milady appeared to have resumed her selfpossession which she had never lost when Felton had seen her recover with the veil of chastity those treasures of love which were only concealed from him to make him desire them the more ardently he said Ah now I have only one thing to ask of you that is the name of your true executioner	160.70315551757812
For to me there is but one the other was an instrument that was all	74.6461181640625
What brother cried Milady must I name him again Have you not yet divined who he is	47.106571197509766
What cried Felton heagain healways he Whatthe truly guilty	3.918487548828125
The truly guilty said Milady is the ravager of England the persecutor of true believers the base ravisher of the honor of so many womenhe who to satisfy a caprice of his corrupt heart is about to make England shed so much blood who protects the Protestants today and will betray them tomorrow	117.90007019042969
Buckingham It is then Buckingham cried Felton in a high state of excitement	282.54046630859375
Milady concealed her face in her hands as if she could not endure the shame which this name recalled to her	167.9394989013672
Buckingham the executioner of this angelic creature cried Felton	109.50550079345703
And thou hast not hurled thy thunder at him my God And thou hast left him noble honored powerful for the ruin of us all	198.08389282226562
God abandons him who abandons himself said Milady	41.407413482666016
But he will draw upon his head the punishment reserved for the damned said Felton with increasing exultation	333.8948974609375
He wills that human vengeance should precede celestial justice	874.1320190429688
Men fear him and spare him	98.82083892822266
I said Felton I do not fear him nor will I spare him	258.83294677734375
The soul of Milady was bathed in an infernal joy	185.9130096435547
But how can Lord de Winter my protector my father asked Felton possibly be mixed up with all this	13.781810760498047
Listen Felton resumed Milady for by the side of base and contemptible men there are often found great and generous natures	674.6509399414062
I had an affianced husband a man whom I loved and who loved mea heart like yours Felton a man like you	232.46298217773438
I went to him and told him all he knew me that man did and did not doubt an instant	494.93798828125
He was a nobleman a man equal to Buckingham in every respect	83.15217590332031
He said nothing he only girded on his sword wrapped himself in his cloak and went straight to Buckingham Palace	341.8020935058594
Yes yes said Felton I understand how he would act	87.09346771240234
But with such men it is not the sword that should be employed it is the poniard	245.56297302246094
Buckingham had left England the day before sent as ambassador to Spain to demand the hand of the Infanta for King Charles I	140.44300842285156
who was then only Prince of Wales	99.52169036865234
My affianced husband returned	117.96501922607422
Hear me said he this man has gone and for the moment has consequently escaped my vengeance but let us be united as we were to have been and then leave it to Lord de Winter to maintain his own honor and that of his wife	325.7994689941406
Lord de Winter cried Felton	221.63555908203125
Yes said Milady Lord de Winter and now you can understand it all can you not Buckingham remained nearly a year absent	28.538410186767578
A week before his return Lord de Winter died leaving me his sole heir	83.12982177734375
Whence came the blow God who knows all knows without doubt but as for me I accuse nobody	260.9679870605469
Oh what an abyss what an abyss cried Felton	166.71578979492188
Lord de Winter died without revealing anything to his brother	60.91839599609375
The terrible secret was to be concealed till it burst like a clap of thunder over the head of the guilty	7079.05615234375
Your protector had seen with pain this marriage of his elder brother with a portionless girl	222.13250732421875
I was sensible that I could look for no support from a man disappointed in his hopes of an inheritance	159.43353271484375
I went to France with a determination to remain there for the rest of my life	202.90725708007812
But all my fortune is in England	284.15435791015625
Communication being closed by the war I was in want of everything	158.072998046875
I was then obliged to come back again	66.72598266601562
Six days ago I landed at Portsmouth	308.7010192871094
Well said Felton	253.044189453125
Well Buckingham heard by some means no doubt of my return	283.83135986328125
He spoke of me to Lord de Winter already prejudiced against me and told him that his sisterinlaw was a prostitute a branded woman	63.19981002807617
The noble and pure voice of my husband was no longer here to defend me	74.0196304321289
Lord de Winter believed all that was told him with so much the more ease that it was his interest to believe it	314.13720703125
He caused me to be arrested had me conducted hither and placed me under your guard	494.022216796875
You know the rest	297.98809814453125
The day after tomorrow he banishes me he transports me the day after tomorrow he exiles me among the infamous	42.95146560668945
Oh the train is well laid the plot is clever	542.6533203125
My honor will not survive it You see then Felton I can do nothing but die	80.15457153320312
Felton give me that knife	71.027099609375
And at these words as if all her strength was exhausted Milady sank weak and languishing into the arms of the young officer who intoxicated with love anger and voluptuous sensations hitherto unknown received her with transport pressed her against his heart all trembling at the breath from that charming mouth bewildered by the contact with that palpitating bosom	205.65658569335938
No no said he	341.4163513183594
No you shall live honored and pure you shall live to triumph over your enemies	13.927093505859375
Milady put him from her slowly with her hand while drawing him nearer with her look but Felton in his turn embraced her more closely imploring her like a divinity	93.26872253417969
Oh death death said she lowering her voice and her eyelids oh death rather than shame Felton my brother my friend I conjure you	229.76739501953125
No cried Felton no you shall live and you shall be avenged	253.20965576171875
Felton I bring misfortune to all who surround me Felton abandon me Felton let me die	678.451904296875
Well then we will live and die together cried he pressing his lips to those of the prisoner	2.000459671020508
Several strokes resounded on the door this time Milady really pushed him away from her	321.40093994140625
Hark said she we have been overheard Someone is coming All is over We are lost	80.04338836669922
No said Felton it is only the sentinel warning me that they are about to change the guard	231.2178497314453
Then run to the door and open it yourself	153.31944274902344
Felton obeyed this woman was now his whole thought his whole soul	106.04097747802734
He found himself face to face with a sergeant commanding a watchpatrol	98.57380676269531
Well what is the matter asked the young lieutenant	149.3444061279297
You told me to open the door if I heard anyone cry out said the soldier but you forgot to leave me the key	142.6930389404297
I heard you cry out without understanding what you said	502.77935791015625
I tried to open the door but it was locked inside then I called the sergeant	93.28775787353516
And here I am said the sergeant	393.69610595703125
Felton quite bewildered almost mad stood speechless	78.00347137451172
Milady plainly perceived that it was now her turn to take part in the scene	87.50883483886719
She ran to the table and seizing the knife which Felton had laid down exclaimed And by what right will you prevent me from dying	495.5169982910156
Great God exclaimed Felton on seeing the knife glitter in her hand	103.55939483642578
At that moment a burst of ironical laughter resounded through the corridor	504.68505859375
The baron attracted by the noise in his chamber gown his sword under his arm stood in the doorway	73.50751495361328
Ah said he here we are at the last act of the tragedy	88.02665710449219
You see Felton the drama has gone through all the phases I named but be easy no blood will flow	96.26426696777344
Milady perceived that all was lost unless she gave Felton an immediate and terrible proof of her courage	44.91382598876953
You are mistaken my Lord blood will flow and may that blood fall back on those who cause it to flow	95.92111206054688
Felton uttered a cry and rushed toward her	66.49333190917969
He was too late Milady had stabbed herself	123.74541473388672
But the knife had fortunately we ought to say skillfully come in contact with the steel busk which at that period like a cuirass defended the chests of women	435.4767150878906
It had glided down it tearing the robe and had penetrated slantingly between the flesh and the ribs	82.65550994873047
Miladys robe was not the less stained with blood in a second	2649.523193359375
Milady fell down and seemed to be in a swoon	1930.176513671875
Felton snatched away the knife	53.56196594238281
See my Lord said he in a deep gloomy tone here is a woman who was under my guard and who has killed herself	255.8135528564453
Be at ease Felton said Lord de Winter	433.1429748535156
She is not dead demons do not die so easily	320.3205871582031
Be tranquil and go wait for me in my chamber	432.7244873046875
But my Lord	34.1268310546875
Go sir I command you	407.5100402832031
At this injunction from his superior Felton obeyed but in going out he put the knife into his bosom	110.73125457763672
As to Lord de Winter he contented himself with calling the woman who waited on Milady and when she was come he recommended the prisoner who was still fainting to her care and left them alone	128.37696838378906
Meanwhile all things considered and notwithstanding his suspicions as the wound might be serious he immediately sent off a mounted man to find a physician	63.78907775878906
Chapter LVIII	402.9668273925781
As Lord de Winter had thought Miladys wound was not dangerous	805.6776733398438
So soon as she was left alone with the woman whom the baron had summoned to her assistance she opened her eyes	112.82508850097656
It was however necessary to affect weakness and painnot a very difficult task for so finished an actress as Milady	57.27190017700195
Thus the poor woman was completely the dupe of the prisoner whom notwithstanding her hints she persisted in watching all night	62.54222106933594
But the presence of this woman did not prevent Milady from thinking	85.64146423339844
There was no longer a doubt that Felton was convinced Felton was hers	413.3827819824219
If an angel appeared to that young man as an accuser of Milady he would take him in the mental disposition in which he now found himself for a messenger sent by the devil	113.78065490722656
Milady smiled at this thought for Felton was now her only hopeher only means of safety	246.697998046875
But Lord de Winter might suspect him Felton himself might now be watched	35.231075286865234
Toward four oclock in the morning the doctor arrived but since the time Milady stabbed herself however short the wound had closed	103.33234405517578
The doctor could therefore measure neither the direction nor the depth of it he only satisfied himself by Miladys pulse that the case was not serious	197.20082092285156
In the morning Milady under the pretext that she had not slept well in the night and wanted rest sent away the woman who attended her	579.5753173828125
She had one hope which was that Felton would appear at the breakfast hour but Felton did not come	77.376220703125
Were her fears realized Was Felton suspected by the baron about to fail her at the decisive moment She had only one day left	294.69805908203125
Lord de Winter had announced her embarkation for the twentythird and it was now the morning of the twentysecond	316.5928649902344
Nevertheless she still waited patiently till the hour for dinner	56.90399932861328
Although she had eaten nothing in the morning the dinner was brought in at its usual time	45.30894088745117
Milady then perceived with terror that the uniform of the soldiers who guarded her was changed	70.5621337890625
Then she ventured to ask what had become of Felton	97.88717651367188
She was told that he had left the castle an hour before on horseback	1466.41162109375
She inquired if the baron was still at the castle	169.0435791015625
The soldier replied that he was and that he had given orders to be informed if the prisoner wished to speak to him	175.1540069580078
Milady replied that she was too weak at present and that her only desire was to be left alone	491.0390625
The soldier went out leaving the dinner served	1063.783203125
Felton was sent away	219.1055450439453
The marines were removed	183.50128173828125
Felton was then mistrusted	541.2340698242188
This was the last blow to the prisoner	164.35792541503906
Left alone she arose	30.09144401550293
The bed which she had kept from prudence and that they might believe her seriously wounded burned her like a bed of fire	138.15499877929688
She cast a glance at the door the baron had had a plank nailed over the grating	108.09393310546875
He no doubt feared that by this opening she might still by some diabolical means corrupt her guards	239.1839599609375
Milady smiled with joy	115.64702606201172
She was free now to give way to her transports without being observed	60.880615234375
She traversed her chamber with the excitement of a furious maniac or of a tigress shut up in an iron cage	281.6870422363281
Certes if the knife had been left in her power she would now have thought not of killing herself but of killing the baron	183.44644165039062
At six oclock Lord de Winter came in	40.102500915527344
He was armed at all points	539.7655029296875
This man in whom Milady till that time had only seen a very simple gentleman had become an admirable jailer	195.69735717773438
He appeared to foresee all to divine all to anticipate all	69.31133270263672
A single look at Milady apprised him of all that was passing in her mind	42.147499084472656
Ay said he I see but you shall not kill me today	11.373861312866211
You have no longer a weapon and besides I am on my guard	23353.16796875
You had begun to pervert my poor Felton	427.593994140625
He was yielding to your infernal influence but I will save him	83.16653442382812
He will never see you again all is over	188.28810119628906
Get your clothes together	298.5827331542969
Tomorrow you will go	175.7245330810547
I had fixed the embarkation for the twentyfourth but I have reflected that the more promptly the affair takes place the more sure it will be	807.677490234375
Tomorrow by twelve oclock I shall have the order for your exile signed Buckingham	83.66780090332031
If you speak a single word to anyone before going aboard ship my sergeant will blow your brains out	29.990663528442383
He has orders to do so	473.7999572753906
If when on the ship you speak a single word to anyone before the captain permits you the captain will have you thrown into the sea	12.06812572479248
That is agreed upon	120.46048736572266
Au revoir then that is all I have to say today	35.63383483886719
Tomorrow I will see you again to take my leave	139.9232940673828
With these words the baron went out	117.13092041015625
Milady had listened to all this menacing tirade with a smile of disdain on her lips but rage in her heart	102.7090072631836
Supper was served	37.981903076171875
Milady felt that she stood in need of all her strength	36.04605484008789
She did not know what might take place during this night which approached so menacinglyfor large masses of cloud rolled over the face of the sky and distant lightning announced a storm	35.429874420166016
The storm broke about ten oclock	50.65361785888672
Milady felt a consolation in seeing nature partake of the disorder of her heart	146.6536102294922
The thunder growled in the air like the passion and anger in her thoughts	130.6427001953125
It appeared to her that the blast as it swept along disheveled her brow as it bowed the branches of the trees and bore away their leaves	1518.91748046875
She howled as the hurricane howled and her voice was lost in the great voice of nature which also seemed to groan with despair	137.36135864257812
All at once she heard a tap at her window and by the help of a flash of lightning she saw the face of a man appear behind the bars	1811.3880615234375
She ran to the window and opened it	136.6995849609375
Felton cried she	28.605180740356445
I am saved	90.33153533935547
Yes said Felton but silence silence I must have time to file through these bars	66.8725357055664
Only take care that I am not seen through the wicket	233.30149841308594
Oh it is a proof that the Lord is on our side Felton replied Milady	182.35877990722656
They have closed up the grating with a board	16.635757446289062
That is well God has made them senseless said Felton	187.06271362304688
But what must I do asked Milady	272.1690673828125
Nothing nothing only shut the window	28.591886520385742
Go to bed or at least lie down in your clothes	43.2723274230957
As soon as I have done I will knock on one of the panes of glass	65.44025421142578
But will you be able to follow me	172.28225708007812
Oh yes	299.2546691894531
Your wound	141.65234375
Gives me pain but will not prevent my walking	93.20785522460938
Be ready then at the first signal	6.000772476196289
Milady shut the window extinguished the lamp and went as Felton had desired her to lie down on the bed	153.91864013671875
Amid the moaning of the storm she heard the grinding of the file upon the bars and by the light of every flash she perceived the shadow of Felton through the panes	306.0919494628906
She passed an hour without breathing panting with a cold sweat upon her brow and her heart oppressed by frightful agony at every movement she heard in the corridor	179.2932891845703
There are hours which last a year	14.466283798217773
At the expiration of an hour Felton tapped again	74.4058837890625
Milady sprang out of bed and opened the window	762.0274047851562
Two bars removed formed an opening for a man to pass through	372.1589660644531
Are you ready asked Felton	1513.409912109375
Must I take anything with me	871.0787963867188
Money if you have any	67.87126922607422
Yes fortunately they have left me all I had	224.41693115234375
So much the better for I have expended all mine in chartering a vessel	115.2817153930664
Here said Milady placing a bag full of louis in Feltons hands	753.4846801757812
Felton took the bag and threw it to the foot of the wall	73.66924285888672
Now said he will you come	474.8580322265625
I am ready	912.666015625
Milady mounted upon a chair and passed the upper part of her body through the window	30.234560012817383
She saw the young officer suspended over the abyss by a ladder of ropes	93.16861724853516
For the first time an emotion of terror reminded her that she was a woman	141.10345458984375
The dark space frightened her	66.59769439697266
I expected this said Felton	341.953369140625
Its nothing its nothing said Milady	80.85082244873047
I will descend with my eyes shut	189.4303436279297
Have you confidence in me said Felton	330.1025085449219
You ask that	197.5327606201172
Put your two hands together	205.75103759765625
Cross them that s right	90.79653930664062
Felton tied her two wrists together with his handkerchief and then with a cord over the handkerchief	176.9783172607422
What are you doing asked Milady with surprise	426.975830078125
Pass your arms around my neck and fear nothing	229.52978515625
But I shall make you lose your balance and we shall both be dashed to pieces	165.89060974121094
Do nt be afraid	234.3972625732422
I am a sailor	87.34112548828125
Not a second was to be lost	1619.355224609375
Milady passed her two arms round Feltons neck and let herself slip out of the window	204.84268188476562
Felton began to descend the ladder slowly step by step	315.75262451171875
Despite the weight of two bodies the blast of the hurricane shook them in the air	318.7553405761719
All at once Felton stopped	73.44609069824219
What is the matter asked Milady	107.54341125488281
Silence said Felton I hear footsteps	131.89405822753906
We are discovered	26120.380859375
There was a silence of several seconds	362.3615417480469
No said Felton it is nothing	35.607017517089844
But what then is the noise	71.0168685913086
That of the patrol going their rounds	1776.73291015625
Where is their road	131.2657012939453
Just under us	228.4771270751953
They will discover us	387.56005859375
No if it does not lighten	90.751220703125
But they will run against the bottom of the ladder	72.78302764892578
Fortunately it is too short by six feet	106.30245971679688
Here they are My God	990.729248046875
Both remained suspended motionless and breathless within twenty paces of the ground while the patrol passed beneath them laughing and talking	137.2400360107422
This was a terrible moment for the fugitives	60.49983596801758
The patrol passed	84.84498596191406
The noise of their retreating footsteps and the murmur of their voices soon died away	11.562064170837402
Now said Felton we are safe	37.45307540893555
Milady breathed a deep sigh and fainted	380.91961669921875
Felton continued to descend	13.394693374633789
Near the bottom of the ladder when he found no more support for his feet he clung with his hands at length arrived at the last step he let himself hang by the strength of his wrists and touched the ground	1373.1531982421875
He stooped down picked up the bag of money and placed it between his teeth	259.1419372558594
Then he took Milady in his arms and set off briskly in the direction opposite to that which the patrol had taken	173.63381958007812
He soon left the pathway of the patrol descended across the rocks and when arrived on the edge of the sea whistled	44.03532791137695
A similar signal replied to him and five minutes after a boat appeared rowed by four men	22.68711280822754
The boat approached as near as it could to the shore but there was not depth enough of water for it to touch land	34.37809371948242
Felton walked into the sea up to his middle being unwilling to trust his precious burden to anybody	156.53541564941406
Fortunately the storm began to subside but still the sea was disturbed	8684.498046875
The little boat bounded over the waves like a nutshell	91.68495178222656
To the sloop said Felton and row quickly	300.7500915527344
The four men bent to their oars but the sea was too high to let them get much hold of it	68.89098358154297
However they left the castle behind that was the principal thing	69.52254486083984
The night was extremely dark	45.59896469116211
It was almost impossible to see the shore from the boat they would therefore be less likely to see the boat from the shore	70.483642578125
A black point floated on the sea	34.38240051269531
That was the sloop	107.685302734375
While the boat was advancing with all the speed its four rowers could give it Felton untied the cord and then the handkerchief which bound Miladys hands together	79.96247100830078
When her hands were loosed he took some sea water and sprinkled it over her face	56.74264144897461
Milady breathed a sigh and opened her eyes	33.349456787109375
Where am I said she	27.787429809570312
Saved replied the young officer	81.8137435913086
Oh saved saved cried she	108.49600219726562
Yes there is the sky here is the sea The air I breathe is the air of liberty Ah thanks Felton thanks	94.13462829589844
The young man pressed her to his heart	104.70515441894531
But what is the matter with my hands asked Milady it seems as if my wrists had been crushed in a vice	209.99557495117188
Milady held out her arms her wrists were bruised	647.1802368164062
Alas said Felton looking at those beautiful hands and shaking his head sorrowfully	56.96760940551758
Oh its nothing nothing cried Milady	321.50225830078125
I remember now	138.51185607910156
Milady looked around her as if in search of something	787.3126220703125
It is there said Felton touching the bag of money with his foot	109.9052734375
They drew near to the sloop	170.62890625
A sailor on watch hailed the boat the boat replied	103.0540771484375
What vessel is that asked Milady	51.11069869995117
The one I have hired for you	44.159664154052734
Where will it take me	2.000459671020508
Where you please after you have put me on shore at Portsmouth	748.2789916992188
What are you going to do at Portsmouth asked Milady	339.44342041015625
Accomplish the orders of Lord de Winter said Felton with a gloomy smile	1053.2864990234375
What orders asked Milady	62.446502685546875
You do not understand asked Felton	572.242919921875
No explain yourself I beg	181.1956329345703
As he mistrusted me he determined to guard you himself and sent me in his place to get Buckingham to sign the order for your transportation	62.70466232299805
But if he mistrusted you how could he confide such an order to you	105.57709503173828
How could I know what I was the bearer of	458.0877990722656
That s true And you are going to Portsmouth	464.2380676269531
I have no time to lose	43.053009033203125
Tomorrow is the twentythird and Buckingham sets sail tomorrow with his fleet	794.4056396484375
He sets sail tomorrow Where for	521.0880126953125
For La Rochelle	556.83740234375
He need not sail cried Milady forgetting her usual presence of mind	313.4266357421875
Be satisfied replied Felton he will not sail	70.18551635742188
Milady started with joy	215.61874389648438
She could read to the depths of the heart of this young man the death of Buckingham was written there at full length	329.815673828125
Felton cried she you are as great as Judas Maccabeus If you die I will die with you that is all I can say to you	3696.583251953125
Silence cried Felton we are here	212.19129943847656
In fact they touched the sloop	97.87943267822266
Felton mounted the ladder first and gave his hand to Milady while the sailors supported her for the sea was still much agitated	272.8599548339844
An instant after they were on the deck	458.74468994140625
Captain said Felton this is the person of whom I spoke to you and whom you must convey safe and sound to France	253.2309112548828
For a thousand pistoles said the captain	607.6707153320312
I have paid you five hundred of them	546.6981811523438
That s correct said the captain	193.96205139160156
And here are the other five hundred replied Milady placing her hand upon the bag of gold	73.99969482421875
No said the captain I make but one bargain and I have agreed with this young man that the other five hundred shall not be due to me till we arrive at Boulogne	168.19947814941406
And shall we arrive there	95.58028411865234
Safe and sound as true as my names Jack Butler	136.49974060058594
Well said Milady if you keep your word instead of five hundred I will give you a thousand pistoles	305.2936096191406
Hurrah for you then my beautiful lady cried the captain and may God often send me such passengers as your Ladyship	309.1637268066406
Meanwhile said Felton convey me to the little bay of you know it was agreed you should put in there	272.60430908203125
The captain replied by ordering the necessary maneuvers and toward seven oclock in the morning the little vessel cast anchor in the bay that had been named	222.2811737060547
During this passage Felton related everything to Miladyhow instead of going to London he had chartered the little vessel how he had returned how he had scaled the wall by fastening cramps in the interstices of the stones as he ascended to give him foothold and how when he had reached the bars he fastened his ladder	129.29225158691406
Milady knew the rest	32.00050354003906
On her side Milady tried to encourage Felton in his project but at the first words which issued from her mouth she plainly saw that the young fanatic stood more in need of being moderated than urged	44.22822570800781
It was agreed that Milady should wait for Felton till ten oclock if he did not return by ten oclock she was to sail	202.42298889160156
In that case and supposing he was at liberty he was to rejoin her in France at the convent of the Carmelites at Bthune	103.7458267211914
Chapter LIX	162.978515625
WHAT TOOK PLACE AT PORTSMOUTH AUGUST 23 1628	240.16738891601562
Felton took leave of Milady as a brother about to go for a mere walk takes leave of his sister kissing her hand	28.27405548095703
His whole body appeared in its ordinary state of calmness only an unusual fire beamed from his eyes like the effects of a fever his brow was more pale than it generally was his teeth were clenched and his speech had a short dry accent which indicated that something dark was at work within him	59.900577545166016
As long as he remained in the boat which conveyed him to land he kept his face toward Milady who standing on the deck followed him with her eyes	71.99932098388672
Both were free from the fear of pursuit nobody ever came into Miladys apartment before nine oclock and it would require three hours to go from the castle to London	155.37709045410156
Felton jumped onshore climbed the little ascent which led to the top of the cliff saluted Milady a last time and took his course toward the city	16.965757369995117
At the end of a hundred paces the ground began to decline and he could only see the mast of the sloop	17.912986755371094
He immediately ran in the direction of Portsmouth which he saw at nearly half a league before him standing out in the haze of the morning with its houses and towers	82.57301330566406
Beyond Portsmouth the sea was covered with vessels whose masts like a forest of poplars despoiled by the winter bent with each breath of the wind	49.42179870605469
Felton in his rapid walk reviewed in his mind all the accusations against the favorite of James I	224.14303588867188
and Charles I	133.54879760742188
furnished by two years of premature meditation and a long sojourn among the Puritans	167.45004272460938
When he compared the public crimes of this ministerstartling crimes European crimes if so we may saywith the private and unknown crimes with which Milady had charged him Felton found that the more culpable of the two men which formed the character of Buckingham was the one of whom the public knew not the life	253.7488555908203
This was because his love so strange so new and so ardent made him view the infamous and imaginary accusations of Milady de Winter as through a magnifying glass one views as frightful monsters atoms in reality imperceptible by the side of an ant	135.52638244628906
The rapidity of his walk heated his blood still more the idea that he left behind him exposed to a frightful vengeance the woman he loved or rather whom he adored as a saint the emotion he had experienced present fatigueall together exalted his mind above human feeling	418.4333190917969
He entered Portsmouth about eight oclock in the morning	192.56224060058594
The whole population was on foot drums were beating in the streets and in the port the troops about to embark were marching toward the sea	48.17631149291992
Felton arrived at the palace of the Admiralty covered with dust and streaming with perspiration	852.3723754882812
His countenance usually so pale was purple with heat and passion	36.732757568359375
The sentinel wanted to repulse him but Felton called to the officer of the post and drawing from his pocket the letter of which he was the bearer he said A pressing message from Lord de Winter	45.79811096191406
At the name of Lord de Winter who was known to be one of his Graces most intimate friends the officer of the post gave orders to let Felton pass who besides wore the uniform of a naval officer	56.1761589050293
Felton darted into the palace	278.0556945800781
At the moment he entered the vestibule another man was entering likewise dusty out of breath leaving at the gate a post horse which on reaching the palace tumbled on his foreknees	93.39702606201172
Felton and he addressed Patrick the dukes confidential lackey at the same moment	119.39056396484375
Felton named Lord de Winter the unknown would not name anybody and pretended that it was to the duke alone he would make himself known	44.28895950317383
Each was anxious to gain admission before the other	63.743404388427734
Patrick who knew Lord de Winter was in affairs of the service and in relations of friendship with the duke gave the preference to the one who came in his name	73.8742904663086
The other was forced to wait and it was easily to be seen how he cursed the delay	86.69209289550781
The valet led Felton through a large hall in which waited the deputies from La Rochelle headed by the Prince de Soubise and introduced him into a closet where Buckingham just out of the bath was finishing his toilet upon which as at all times he bestowed extraordinary attention	127.29984283447266
Lieutenant Felton from Lord de Winter said Patrick	1342.152099609375
From Lord de Winter repeated Buckingham let him come in	58.932212829589844
Felton entered	52.79158020019531
At that moment Buckingham was throwing upon a couch a rich toilet robe worked with gold in order to put on a blue velvet doublet embroidered with pearls	108.18314361572266
Why did nt the baron come himself demanded Buckingham	132.61981201171875
I expected him this morning	51.172237396240234
He desired me to tell your Grace replied Felton that he very much regretted not having that honor but that he was prevented by the guard he is obliged to keep at the castle	233.3130645751953
Yes I know that said Buckingham he has a prisoner	297.5338439941406
It is of that prisoner that I wish to speak to your Grace replied Felton	238.83303833007812
Well then speak	43.00709915161133
That which I have to say of her can only be heard by yourself my Lord	212.315673828125
Leave us Patrick said Buckingham but remain within sound of the bell	553.3255615234375
I shall call you presently	115.11296844482422
Patrick went out	239.95263671875
We are alone sir said Buckingham speak	341.2454528808594
My Lord said Felton the Baron de Winter wrote to you the other day to request you to sign an order of embarkation relative to a young woman named Charlotte Backson	67.13097381591797
Yes sir and I answered him to bring or send me that order and I would sign it	3105.129150390625
Here it is my Lord	288.4633483886719
Give it to me said the duke	59.669010162353516
And taking it from Felton he cast a rapid glance over the paper and perceiving that it was the one that had been mentioned to him he placed it on the table took a pen and prepared to sign it	97.05551147460938
Pardon my Lord said Felton stopping the duke but does your Grace know that the name of Charlotte Backson is not the true name of this young woman	86.18480682373047
Yes sir I know it replied the duke dipping the quill in the ink	24.692899703979492
Then your Grace knows her real name asked Felton in a sharp tone	60.243595123291016
I know it and the duke put the quill to the paper	112.52753448486328
Felton grew pale	185.47445678710938
And knowing that real name my Lord replied Felton will you sign it all the same	12.572990417480469
Doubtless said Buckingham and rather twice than once	59.24016189575195
I can not believe continued Felton in a voice that became more sharp and rough that your Grace knows that it is to Milady de Winter this relates	51.885765075683594
I know it perfectly although I am astonished that you know it	125.8849868774414
And will your Grace sign that order without remorse	62.65809631347656
Buckingham looked at the young man haughtily	310.06488037109375
Do you know sir that you are asking me very strange questions and that I am very foolish to answer them	71.91679382324219
Reply to them my Lord said Felton the circumstances are more serious than you perhaps believe	31.757734298706055
Buckingham reflected that the young man coming from Lord de Winter undoubtedly spoke in his name and softened	90.89136505126953
Without remorse said he	168.63893127441406
The baron knows as well as myself that Milady de Winter is a very guilty woman and it is treating her very favorably to commute her punishment to transportation	41.95014572143555
The duke put his pen to the paper	68.23057556152344
You will not sign that order my Lord said Felton making a step toward the duke	59.940093994140625
I will not sign this order And why not	150.03948974609375
Because you will look into yourself and you will do justice to the lady	50.255279541015625
I should do her justice by sending her to Tyburn said Buckingham	531.101318359375
This lady is infamous	106.95784759521484
My Lord Milady de Winter is an angel you know that she is and I demand her liberty of you	528.4639892578125
Bah Are you mad to talk to me thus said Buckingham	60.45576858520508
My Lord excuse me I speak as I can I restrain myself	60.88601303100586
But my Lord think of what you re about to do and beware of going too far	202.10519409179688
What do you say God pardon me cried Buckingham I really think he threatens me	354.0606384277344
No my Lord I still plead	339.5762939453125
And I say to you one drop of water suffices to make the full vase overflow one slight fault may draw down punishment upon the head spared despite many crimes	389.48992919921875
Felton said Buckingham you will withdraw and place yourself at once under arrest	95.49327087402344
You will hear me to the end my Lord	144.5966339111328
You have seduced this young girl you have outraged defiled her	136.97027587890625
Repair your crimes toward her let her go free and I will exact nothing else from you	559.4127807617188
You will exact said Buckingham looking at Felton with astonishment and dwelling upon each syllable of the three words as he pronounced them	48.03826141357422
My Lord continued Felton becoming more excited as he spoke my Lord beware All England is tired of your iniquities my Lord you have abused the royal power which you have almost usurped my Lord you are held in horror by God and men	30.16924285888672
God will punish you hereafter but I will punish you here	49.738990783691406
Ah this is too much cried Buckingham making a step toward the door	152.7662811279297
Felton barred his passage	411.04217529296875
I ask it humbly of you my Lord said he sign the order for the liberation of Milady de Winter	63.501976013183594
Remember that she is a woman whom you have dishonored	588.3633422851562
Withdraw sir said Buckingham or I will call my attendant and have you placed in irons	74.9851303100586
You shall not call said Felton throwing himself between the duke and the bell placed on a stand encrusted with silver	202.5750732421875
Beware my Lord you are in the hands of God	4.71235990524292
In the hands of the devil you mean cried Buckingham raising his voice so as to attract the notice of his people without absolutely shouting	29.635953903198242
Sign my Lord sign the liberation of Milady de Winter said Felton holding out a paper to the duke	72.01810455322266
By force You are joking Holloa Patrick	44.08606719970703
Sign my Lord	171.2469940185547
Help shouted the duke and at the same time he sprang toward his sword	228.581298828125
But Felton did not give him time to draw it	110.92695617675781
He held the knife with which Milady had stabbed herself open in his bosom at one bound he was upon the duke	4858.7705078125
At that moment Patrick entered the room crying A letter from France my Lord	165.57498168945312
From France cried Buckingham forgetting everything in thinking from whom that letter came	285.89532470703125
Felton took advantage of this moment and plunged the knife into his side up to the handle	92.3802490234375
Ah traitor cried Buckingham you have killed me	237.28379821777344
Murder screamed Patrick	136.0775909423828
Felton cast his eyes round for means of escape and seeing the door free he rushed into the next chamber in which as we have said the deputies from La Rochelle were waiting crossed it as quickly as possible and rushed toward the staircase but upon the first step he met Lord de Winter who seeing him pale confused livid and stained with blood both on his hands and face seized him by the throat crying I knew it I guessed it But too late by a minute unfortunate unfortunate that I am	107.32733154296875
Felton made no resistance	376.95330810546875
Lord de Winter placed him in the hands of the guards who led him while awaiting further orders to a little terrace commanding the sea and then the baron hastened to the dukes chamber	543.3741455078125
At the cry uttered by the duke and the scream of Patrick the man whom Felton had met in the antechamber rushed into the chamber	1989.0960693359375
He found the duke reclining upon a sofa with his hand pressed upon the wound	1244.1541748046875
Laporte said the duke in a dying voice Laporte do you come from her	144.53623962402344
Yes monseigneur replied the faithful cloak bearer of Anne of Austria but too late perhaps	126.93736267089844
Silence Laporte you may be overheard	724.6073608398438
Patrick let no one enter	66.81886291503906
Oh I can not tell what she says to me My God I am dying	188.74205017089844
And the duke swooned	57.3748664855957
Meanwhile Lord de Winter the deputies the leaders of the expedition the officers of Buckinghams household had all made their way into the chamber	432.4367370605469
Cries of despair resounded on all sides	144.23345947265625
The news which filled the palace with tears and groans soon became known and spread itself throughout the city	53.62067794799805
The report of a cannon announced that something new and unexpected had taken place	48.90987777709961
Lord de Winter tore his hair	110.19273376464844
Too late by a minute cried he too late by a minute Oh my God my God what a misfortune	132.14833068847656
He had been informed at seven oclock in the morning that a rope ladder floated from one of the windows of the castle he had hastened to Miladys chamber had found it empty the window open and the bars filed had remembered the verbal caution DArtagnan had transmitted to him by his messenger had trembled for the duke and running to the stable without taking time to have a horse saddled had jumped upon the first he found had galloped off like the wind had alighted below in the courtyard had ascended the stairs precipitately and on the top step as we have said had encountered Felton	39.00060272216797
The duke however was not dead	230.3905487060547
He recovered a little reopened his eyes and hope revived in all hearts	92.24261474609375
Gentlemen said he leave me alone with Patrick and Laporteah is that you De Winter You sent me a strange madman this morning See the state in which he has put me	179.14511108398438
Oh my Lord cried the baron I shall never console myself	38.60873794555664
And you would be quite wrong my dear De Winter said Buckingham holding out his hand to him	320.69091796875
I do not know the man who deserves being regretted during the whole life of another man but leave us I pray you	341.5117492675781
The baron went out sobbing	328.2780456542969
There only remained in the closet of the wounded duke Laporte and Patrick	122.7850570678711
A physician was sought for but none was yet found	156.97335815429688
You will live my Lord you will live repeated the faithful servant of Anne of Austria on his knees before the dukes sofa	89.9912109375
What has she written to me said Buckingham feebly streaming with blood and suppressing his agony to speak of her he loved what has she written to me Read me her letter	368.10638427734375
Oh my Lord said Laporte	118.83763122558594
Obey Laporte do you not see I have no time to lose	76.5482406616211
Laporte broke the seal and placed the paper before the eyes of the duke but Buckingham in vain tried to make out the writing	1114.5162353515625
Read said he read I can not see	222.6204833984375
Read then For soon perhaps I shall not hear and I shall die without knowing what she has written to me	50.5515022277832
Laporte made no further objection and read	343.03778076171875
MY LORD By that which since I have known you have suffered by you and for you I conjure you if you have any care for my repose to countermand those great armaments which you are preparing against France to put an end to a war of which it is publicly said religion is the ostensible cause and of which it is generally whispered your love for me is the concealed cause	125.59329223632812
This war may not only bring great catastrophes upon England and France but misfortune upon you my Lord for which I should never console myself	162.16000366210938
Be careful of your life which is menaced and which will be dear to me from the moment I am not obliged to see an enemy in you	241.0148468017578
Your affectionate ANNE	69.69068908691406
Buckingham collected all his remaining strength to listen to the reading of the letter then when it was ended as if he had met with a bitter disappointment he asked Have you nothing else to say to me by the living voice Laporte	321.77801513671875
The queen charged me to tell you to watch over yourself for she had advice that your assassination would be attempted	119.13816833496094
And is that allis that all replied Buckingham impatiently	320.646728515625
She likewise charged me to tell you that she still loved you	66.923095703125
Ah said Buckingham God be praised My death then will not be to her as the death of a stranger	2.000459671020508
Laporte burst into tears	45.218509674072266
Patrick said the duke bring me the casket in which the diamond studs were kept	41.81361770629883
Patrick brought the object desired which Laporte recognized as having belonged to the queen	171.42843627929688
Now the scent bag of white satin on which her cipher is embroidered in pearls	112.40606689453125
Patrick again obeyed	4086.53076171875
Here Laporte said Buckingham these are the only tokens I ever received from herthis silver casket and these two letters	59.57664108276367
You will restore them to her Majesty and as a last memorialhe looked round for some valuable objectyou will add	306.81396484375
He still sought but his eyes darkened by death encountered only the knife which had fallen from the hand of Felton still smoking with the blood spread over its blade	100.078857421875
And you will add to them this knife said the duke pressing the hand of Laporte	51.69203186035156
He had just strength enough to place the scent bag at the bottom of the silver casket and to let the knife fall into it making a sign to Laporte that he was no longer able to speak then in a last convulsion which this time he had not the power to combat he slipped from the sofa to the floor	229.60540771484375
Patrick uttered a loud cry	397.9053649902344
Buckingham tried to smile a last time but death checked his thought which remained engraved on his brow like a last kiss of love	375.78570556640625
At this moment the dukes surgeon arrived quite terrified he was already on board the admirals ship where they had been obliged to seek him	50.84539794921875
He approached the duke took his hand held it for an instant in his own and letting it fall All is useless said he he is dead	65.13858032226562
Dead dead cried Patrick	256.2729797363281
At this cry all the crowd reentered the apartment and throughout the palace and town there was nothing but consternation and tumult	204.6636199951172
As soon as Lord de Winter saw Buckingham was dead he ran to Felton whom the soldiers still guarded on the terrace of the palace	280.4450378417969
Wretch said he to the young man who since the death of Buckingham had regained that coolness and selfpossession which never after abandoned him wretch what have you done	69.43762969970703
I have avenged myself said he	140.45010375976562
Avenged yourself said the baron	58.15726852416992
Rather say that you have served as an instrument to that accursed woman but I swear to you that this crime shall be her last	119.3656234741211
I do nt know what you mean replied Felton quietly and I am ignorant of whom you are speaking my Lord	253.8037872314453
I killed the Duke of Buckingham because he twice refused you yourself to appoint me captain I have punished him for his injustice that is all	130.20816040039062
De Winter stupefied looked on while the soldiers bound Felton and could not tell what to think of such insensibility	673.3185424804688
One thing alone however threw a shade over the pallid brow of Felton	578.1209716796875
At every noise he heard the simple Puritan fancied he recognized the step and voice of Milady coming to throw herself into his arms to accuse herself and die with him	580.4315795898438
All at once he started	59.257652282714844
His eyes became fixed upon a point of the sea commanded by the terrace where he was	142.5125732421875
With the eagle glance of a sailor he had recognized there where another would have seen only a gull hovering over the waves the sail of a sloop which was directed toward the coast of France	308.2598876953125
He grew deadly pale placed his hand upon his heart which was breaking and at once perceived all the treachery	37.460208892822266
One last favor my Lord said he to the baron	71.41602325439453
What asked his Lordship	179.21551513671875
What oclock is it	311.1206970214844
The baron drew out his watch	474.987548828125
It wants ten minutes to nine said he	120.79341125488281
Milady had hastened her departure by an hour and a half	84.5736312866211
As soon as she heard the cannon which announced the fatal event she had ordered the anchor to be weighed	739.4534301757812
The vessel was making way under a blue sky at great distance from the coast	458.0843200683594
God has so willed it said he with the resignation of a fanatic but without however being able to take his eyes from that ship on board of which he doubtless fancied he could distinguish the white outline of her to whom he had sacrificed his life	531.0635986328125
De Winter followed his look observed his feelings and guessed all	53.69160079956055
Be punished alone for the first miserable man said Lord de Winter to Felton who was being dragged away with his eyes turned toward the sea but I swear to you by the memory of my brother whom I have loved so much that your accomplice is not saved	461.3529357910156
Felton lowered his head without pronouncing a syllable	184.5729522705078
As to Lord de Winter he descended the stairs rapidly and went straight to the port	570.6983642578125
Chapter LX	883.07958984375
IN FRANCE	580.031494140625
The first fear of the King of England Charles I	35.63815689086914
on learning of the death of the duke was that such terrible news might discourage the Rochellais he tried says Richelieu in his Memoirs to conceal it from them as long as possible closing all the ports of his kingdom and carefully keeping watch that no vessel should sail until the army which Buckingham was getting together had gone taking upon himself in default of Buckingham to superintend the departure	271.93243408203125
He carried the strictness of this order so far as to detain in England the ambassadors of Denmark who had taken their leave and the regular ambassador of Holland who was to take back to the port of Flushing the Indian merchantmen of which Charles I	62.0645637512207
had made restitution to the United Provinces	196.9046630859375
But as he did not think of giving this order till five hours after the eventthat is to say till two oclock in the afternoontwo vessels had already left the port the one bearing as we know Milady who already anticipating the event was further confirmed in that belief by seeing the black flag flying at the masthead of the admirals ship	111.15155029296875
As to the second vessel we will tell hereafter whom it carried and how it set sail	185.2870330810547
During this time nothing new occurred in the camp at La Rochelle only the king who was bored as always but perhaps a little more so in camp than elsewhere resolved to go incognito and spend the festival of St	552.8740844726562
Louis at St	315.978271484375
Germain and asked the cardinal to order him an escort of only twenty Musketeers	260.7373962402344
The cardinal who sometimes became weary of the king granted this leave of absence with great pleasure to his royal lieutenant who promised to return about the fifteenth of September	104.01827239990234
de Trville being informed of this by his Eminence packed his portmanteau and as without knowing the cause he knew the great desire and even imperative need which his friends had of returning to Paris it goes without saying that he fixed upon them to form part of the escort	84.08277893066406
The four young men heard the news a quarter of an hour after M	98.15654754638672
de Trville for they were the first to whom he communicated it	56.8875846862793
It was then that DArtagnan appreciated the favor the cardinal had conferred upon him in making him at last enter the Musketeersfor without that circumstance he would have been forced to remain in the camp while his companions left it	34.593605041503906
It goes without saying that this impatience to return toward Paris had for a cause the danger which Mme	10.652505874633789
Bonacieux would run of meeting at the convent of Bthune with Milady her mortal enemy	77.7999496459961
Aramis therefore had written immediately to Marie Michon the seamstress at Tours who had such fine acquaintances to obtain from the queen authority for Mme	25.22818374633789
Bonacieux to leave the convent and to retire either into Lorraine or Belgium	45.22370529174805
They had not long to wait for an answer	60.987483978271484
Eight or ten days afterward Aramis received the following letter	10.016118049621582
MY DEAR COUSIN Here is the authorization from my sister to withdraw our little servant from the convent of Bthune the air of which you think is bad for her	174.44776916503906
My sister sends you this authorization with great pleasure for she is very partial to the little girl to whom she intends to be more serviceable hereafter	207.8924560546875
I salute you MARIE MICHON	28.223127365112305
To this letter was added an order conceived in these terms	67.58851623535156
At the Louvre August 10 1628	50.500091552734375
The superior of the convent of Bthune will place in the hands of the person who shall present this note to her the novice who entered the convent upon my recommendation and under my patronage	177.626708984375
It may be easily imagined how the relationship between Aramis and a seamstress who called the queen her sister amused the young men but Aramis after having blushed two or three times up to the whites of his eyes at the gross pleasantry of Porthos begged his friends not to revert to the subject again declaring that if a single word more was said to him about it he would never again implore his cousins to interfere in such affairs	1202.8123779296875
There was no further question therefore about Marie Michon among the four Musketeers who besides had what they wanted that was the order to withdraw Mme	794.7617797851562
Bonacieux from the convent of the Carmelites of Bthune	96.76378631591797
It was true that this order would not be of great use to them while they were in camp at La Rochelle that is to say at the other end of France	14.969939231872559
Therefore DArtagnan was going to ask leave of absence of M	201.99603271484375
de Trville confiding to him candidly the importance of his departure when the news was transmitted to him as well as to his three friends that the king was about to set out for Paris with an escort of twenty Musketeers and that they formed part of the escort	64.186279296875
Their joy was great	89.58601379394531
The lackeys were sent on before with the baggage and they set out on the morning of the sixteenth	680.2516479492188
The cardinal accompanied his Majesty from Surgres to Mauzes and there the king and his minister took leave of each other with great demonstrations of friendship	151.44300842285156
The king however who sought distraction while traveling as fast as possiblefor he was anxious to be in Paris by the twentythirdstopped from time to time to fly the magpie a pastime for which the taste had been formerly inspired in him by de Luynes and for which he had always preserved a great predilection	192.2175750732422
Out of the twenty Musketeers sixteen when this took place rejoiced greatly at this relaxation but the other four cursed it heartily	518.2479858398438
DArtagnan in particular had a perpetual buzzing in his ears which Porthos explained thus A very great lady has told me that this means that somebody is talking of you somewhere	633.5350952148438
At length the escort passed through Paris on the twentythird in the night	1104.3511962890625
The king thanked M	41.329803466796875
de Trville and permitted him to distribute furloughs for four days on condition that the favored parties should not appear in any public place under penalty of the Bastille	135.5050048828125
The first four furloughs granted as may be imagined were to our four friends	49.608497619628906
Still further Athos obtained of M	231.98947143554688
de Trville six days instead of four and introduced into these six days two more nightsfor they set out on the twentyfourth at five oclock in the evening and as a further kindness M	98.44740295410156
de Trville postdated the leave to the morning of the twentyfifth	235.8826904296875
Good Lord said DArtagnan who as we have often said never stumbled at anything	51.93143081665039
It appears to me that we are making a great trouble of a very simple thing	2.000459671020508
In two days and by using up two or three horses that s nothing I have plenty of money I am at Bthune	165.2662353515625
I present my letter from the queen to the superior and I bring back the dear treasure I go to seeknot into Lorraine not into Belgium but to Paris where she will be much better concealed particularly while the cardinal is at La Rochelle	418.0201110839844
Well once returned from the country half by the protection of her cousin half through what we have personally done for her we shall obtain from the queen what we desire	95.6308364868164
Remain then where you are and do not exhaust yourselves with useless fatigue	147.08970642089844
Myself and Planchet are all that such a simple expedition requires	142.4322052001953
To this Athos replied quietly We also have money leftfor I have not yet drunk all my share of the diamond and Porthos and Aramis have not eaten all theirs	216.8623809814453
We can therefore use up four horses as well as one	295.2323913574219
But consider DArtagnan added he in a tone so solemn that it made the young man shudder consider that Bthune is a city where the cardinal has given rendezvous to a woman who wherever she goes brings misery with her	68.39960479736328
If you had only to deal with four men DArtagnan I would allow you to go alone	117.37429809570312
You have to do with that woman We four will go and I hope to God that with our four lackeys we may be in sufficient number	72.46028137207031
You terrify me Athos cried DArtagnan	779.1162109375
My God what do you fear	178.16653442382812
Everything replied Athos	46.24544143676758
DArtagnan examined the countenances of his companions which like that of Athos wore an impression of deep anxiety and they continued their route as fast as their horses could carry them but without adding another word	683.5686645507812
On the evening of the twentyfifth as they were entering Arras and as DArtagnan was dismounting at the inn of the Golden Harrow to drink a glass of wine a horseman came out of the post yard where he had just had a relay started off at a gallop and with a fresh horse took the road to Paris	358.0560607910156
At the moment he passed through the gateway into the street the wind blew open the cloak in which he was wrapped although it was in the month of August and lifted his hat which the traveler seized with his hand the moment it had left his head pulling it eagerly over his eyes	35.0372314453125
DArtagnan who had his eyes fixed upon this man became very pale and let his glass fall	105.33291625976562
What is the matter monsieur said Planchet	581.8650512695312
Oh come gentlemen my master is ill	785.6093139648438
The three friends hastened toward DArtagnan who instead of being ill ran toward his horse	133.6366424560547
They stopped him at the door	654.5760498046875
Well where the devil are you going now cried Athos	127.96284484863281
It is he cried DArtagnan pale with anger and with the sweat on his brow it is he let me overtake him	116.66187286376953
He What he asked Athos	68.63932037353516
He that man	118.34588623046875
What man	288.234375
That cursed man my evil genius whom I have always met with when threatened by some misfortune he who accompanied that horrible woman when I met her for the first time he whom I was seeking when I offended our Athos he whom I saw on the very morning Madame Bonacieux was abducted	190.73300170898438
I have seen him that is he I recognized him when the wind blew upon his cloak	462.9274597167969
The devil said Athos musingly	311.4961242675781
To saddle gentlemen to saddle Let us pursue him and we shall overtake him	356.98223876953125
My dear friend said Aramis remember that he goes in an opposite direction from that in which we are going that he has a fresh horse and ours are fatigued so that we shall disable our own horses without even a chance of overtaking him	566.7431640625
Let the man go DArtagnan let us save the woman	300.5785217285156
Monsieur monsieur cried a hostler running out and looking after the stranger monsieur here is a paper which dropped out of your hat Eh monsieur eh	52.629154205322266
Friend said DArtagnan a halfpistole for that paper	542.8668212890625
My faith monsieur with great pleasure Here it is	802.1039428710938
The hostler enchanted with the good days work he had done returned to the yard	197.8879852294922
DArtagnan unfolded the paper	410.1775817871094
Well eagerly demanded all his three friends	906.004150390625
Nothing but one word said DArtagnan	257.7914123535156
Yes said Aramis but that one word is the name of some town or village	164.29782104492188
Armentires read Porthos Armentires I do nt know such a place	250.01217651367188
And that name of a town or village is written in her hand cried Athos	2725.962158203125
Come on come on said DArtagnan let us keep that paper carefully perhaps I have not thrown away my halfpistole	277.0052185058594
To horse my friends to horse	1048.2958984375
And the four friends flew at a gallop along the road to Bthune	55.37724304199219
Chapter LXI	390.4524230957031
THE CARMELITE CONVENT AT BTHUNE	133.3483428955078
Great criminals bear about them a kind of predestination which makes them surmount all obstacles which makes them escape all dangers up to the moment which a wearied Providence has marked as the rock of their impious fortunes	85.91387176513672
It was thus with Milady	7493.33447265625
She escaped the cruisers of both nations and arrived at Boulogne without accident	2116.755859375
When landing at Portsmouth Milady was an Englishwoman whom the persecutions of the French drove from La Rochelle when landing at Boulogne after a two days passage she passed for a Frenchwoman whom the English persecuted at Portsmouth out of their hatred for France	86.35181427001953
Milady had likewise the best of passportsher beauty her noble appearance and the liberality with which she distributed her pistoles	242.82789611816406
Freed from the usual formalities by the affable smile and gallant manners of an old governor of the port who kissed her hand she only remained long enough at Boulogne to put into the post a letter conceived in the following terms	12.164111137390137
To his Eminence Monseigneur the Cardinal Richelieu in his camp before La Rochelle	82.94412231445312
MONSEIGNEUR Let your Eminence be reassured	96.20470428466797
His Grace the Duke of Buckingham will not set out for France	683.4793701171875
MILADY DE	57.44965744018555
BOULOGNE evening of the twentyfifth	63.46937561035156
According to the desire of your Eminence I report to the convent of the Carmelites at Bthune where I will await your orders	160.38108825683594
Accordingly that same evening Milady commenced her journey	232.06259155273438
Night overtook her she stopped and slept at an inn	97.67424011230469
At five oclock the next morning she again proceeded and in three hours after entered Bthune	146.87046813964844
She inquired for the convent of the Carmelites and went thither immediately	107.12445068359375
The superior met her Milady showed her the cardinals order	63.682735443115234
The abbess assigned her a chamber and had breakfast served	128.4716339111328
All the past was effaced from the eyes of this woman and her looks fixed on the future beheld nothing but the high fortunes reserved for her by the cardinal whom she had so successfully served without his name being in any way mixed up with the sanguinary affair	89.90684509277344
The evernew passions which consumed her gave to her life the appearance of those clouds which float in the heavens reflecting sometimes azure sometimes fire sometimes the opaque blackness of the tempest and which leave no traces upon the earth behind them but devastation and death	61.116825103759766
After breakfast the abbess came to pay her a visit	59.29654312133789
There is very little amusement in the cloister and the good superior was eager to make the acquaintance of her new boarder	142.6712646484375
Milady wished to please the abbess	7.945563316345215
This was a very easy matter for a woman so really superior as she was	58.45695495605469
She tried to be agreeable and she was charming winning the good superior by her varied conversation and by the graces of her whole personality	151.00132751464844
The abbess who was the daughter of a noble house took particular delight in stories of the court which so seldom travel to the extremities of the kingdom and which above all have so much difficulty in penetrating the walls of convents at whose threshold the noise of the world dies away	136.3748321533203
Milady on the contrary was quite conversant with all aristocratic intrigues amid which she had constantly lived for five or six years	67.05368041992188
She made it her business therefore to amuse the good abbess with the worldly practices of the court of France mixed with the eccentric pursuits of the king she made for her the scandalous chronicle of the lords and ladies of the court whom the abbess knew perfectly by name touched lightly on the amours of the queen and the Duke of Buckingham talking a great deal to induce her auditor to talk a little	467.8733825683594
But the abbess contented herself with listening and smiling without replying a word	1001.9780883789062
Milady however saw that this sort of narrative amused her very much and kept at it only she now let her conversation drift toward the cardinal	19.885881423950195
But she was greatly embarrassed	106.8614501953125
She did not know whether the abbess was a royalist or a cardinalist she therefore confined herself to a prudent middle course	220.54356384277344
But the abbess on her part maintained a reserve still more prudent contenting herself with making a profound inclination of the head every time the fair traveler pronounced the name of his Eminence	10.349617958068848
Milady began to think she should soon grow weary of a convent life she resolved then to risk something in order that she might know how to act afterward	12.428528785705566
Desirous of seeing how far the discretion of the good abbess would go she began to tell a story obscure at first but very circumstantial afterward about the cardinal relating the amours of the minister with Mme	185.9764862060547
dAiguillon Marion de Lorme and several other gay women	17.127822875976562
The abbess listened more attentively grew animated by degrees and smiled	89.70099639892578
Good thought Milady she takes a pleasure in my conversation	192.39297485351562
If she is a cardinalist she has no fanaticism at least	242.58128356933594
She then went on to describe the persecutions exercised by the cardinal upon his enemies	135.36563110351562
The abbess only crossed herself without approving or disapproving	86.80419921875
This confirmed Milady in her opinion that the abbess was rather royalist than cardinalist	204.79815673828125
Milady therefore continued coloring her narrations more and more	494.9703369140625
I am very ignorant of these matters said the abbess at length but however distant from the court we may be however remote from the interests of the world we may be placed we have very sad examples of what you have related	475.8959655761719
And one of our boarders has suffered much from the vengeance and persecution of the cardinal	169.98880004882812
One of your boarders said Milady oh my God Poor woman I pity her then	119.8528060913086
And you have reason for she is much to be pitied	376.2154541015625
Imprisonment menaces ill treatmentshe has suffered everything	100.27202606201172
But after all resumed the abbess Monsieur Cardinal has perhaps plausible motives for acting thus and though she has the look of an angel we must not always judge people by the appearance	287.313232421875
Good said Milady to herself who knows I am about perhaps to discover something here I am in the vein	98.21376037597656
She tried to give her countenance an appearance of perfect candor	324.3303527832031
Alas said Milady I know it is so	58.97050094604492
It is said that we must not trust to the face but in what then shall we place confidence if not in the most beautiful work of the Lord As for me I shall be deceived all my life perhaps but I shall always have faith in a person whose countenance inspires me with sympathy	41.55839920043945
You would then be tempted to believe said the abbess that this young person is innocent	82.46854400634766
The cardinal pursues not only crimes said she there are certain virtues which he pursues more severely than certain offenses	444.0055847167969
Permit me madame to express my surprise said the abbess	403.48248291015625
At what said Milady with the utmost ingenuousness	196.24673461914062
At the language you use	142.84976196289062
What do you find so astonishing in that language said Milady smiling	347.1714172363281
You are the friend of the cardinal for he sends you hither and yet	323.0680847167969
And yet I speak ill of him replied Milady finishing the thought of the superior	82.25231170654297
At least you do nt speak well of him	237.42221069335938
That is because I am not his friend said she sighing but his victim	341.8289794921875
But this letter in which he recommends you to me	3985.962158203125
Is an order for me to confine myself to a sort of prison from which he will release me by one of his satellites	107.56259155273438
But why have you not fled	640.465576171875
Whither should I go Do you believe there is a spot on the earth which the cardinal can not reach if he takes the trouble to stretch forth his hand If I were a man that would barely be possible but what can a woman do This young boarder of yours has she tried to fly	40.3541259765625
No that is true but shethat is another thing I believe she is detained in France by some love affair	141.15447998046875
Ah said Milady with a sigh if she loves she is not altogether wretched	286.5932312011719
Then said the abbess looking at Milady with increasing interest I behold another poor victim	131.06336975097656
Alas yes said Milady	150.5692901611328
The abbess looked at her for an instant with uneasiness as if a fresh thought suggested itself to her mind	455.558837890625
You are not an enemy of our holy faith said she hesitatingly	244.23370361328125
WhoI cried Milady I a Protestant Oh no I call to witness the God who hears us that on the contrary I am a fervent Catholic	340.551513671875
Then madame said the abbess smiling be reassured the house in which you are shall not be a very hard prison and we will do all in our power to make you cherish your captivity	379.95904541015625
You will find here moreover the young woman of whom I spoke who is persecuted no doubt in consequence of some court intrigue	136.9604949951172
She is amiable and wellbehaved	107.94816589355469
What is her name	102.94225311279297
She was sent to me by someone of high rank under the name of Kitty	393.2098083496094
I have not tried to discover her other name	140.65814208984375
Kitty cried Milady	532.9146728515625
What Are you sure	192.40455627441406
That she is called so Yes madame	446.97528076171875
Do you know her	263.4747314453125
Milady smiled to herself at the idea which had occurred to her that this might be her old chambermaid	371.80279541015625
There was connected with the remembrance of this girl a remembrance of anger and a desire of vengeance disordered the features of Milady which however immediately recovered the calm and benevolent expression which this woman of a hundred faces had for a moment allowed them to lose	128.08615112304688
And when can I see this young lady for whom I already feel so great a sympathy asked Milady	382.8359680175781
Why this evening said the abbess today even	49.17460632324219
But you have been traveling these four days as you told me yourself	169.2333526611328
This morning you rose at five oclock you must stand in need of repose	56.98513412475586
Go to bed and sleep at dinnertime we will rouse you	49.88915252685547
Although Milady would very willingly have gone without sleep sustained as she was by all the excitements which a new adventure awakened in her heart ever thirsting for intrigues she nevertheless accepted the offer of the superior	49.80064392089844
During the last fifteen days she had experienced so many and such various emotions that if her frame of iron was still capable of supporting fatigue her mind required repose	1011.3208618164062
She therefore took leave of the abbess and went to bed softly rocked by the ideas of vengeance which the name of Kitty had naturally brought to her thoughts	64.95905303955078
She remembered that almost unlimited promise which the cardinal had given her if she succeeded in her enterprise	64.95905303955078
She had succeeded DArtagnan was then in her power	353.2429504394531
One thing alone frightened her that was the remembrance of her husband the Comte de la Fre whom she had believed dead or at least expatriated and whom she found again in Athosthe best friend of DArtagnan	25.975568771362305
But alas if he was the friend of DArtagnan he must have lent him his assistance in all the proceedings by whose aid the queen had defeated the project of his Eminence if he was the friend of DArtagnan he was the enemy of the cardinal and she doubtless would succeed in involving him in the vengeance by which she hoped to destroy the young Musketeer	301.9388732910156
All these hopes were so many sweet thoughts for Milady so rocked by them she soon fell asleep	84.85057067871094
She was awakened by a soft voice which sounded at the foot of her bed	62.052284240722656
She opened her eyes and saw the abbess accompanied by a young woman with light hair and delicate complexion who fixed upon her a look full of benevolent curiosity	68.1121597290039
The face of the young woman was entirely unknown to her	31.937255859375
Each examined the other with great attention while exchanging the customary compliments both were very handsome but of quite different styles of beauty	320.04595947265625
Milady however smiled in observing that she excelled the young woman by far in her high air and aristocratic bearing	110.85060119628906
It is true that the habit of a novice which the young woman wore was not very advantageous in a contest of this kind	101.69375610351562
The abbess introduced them to each other	152.7157440185547
When this formality was ended as her duties called her to chapel she left the two young women alone	115.66455841064453
The novice seeing Milady in bed was about to follow the example of the superior but Milady stopped her	119.29854583740234
How madame said she I have scarcely seen you and you already wish to deprive me of your company upon which I had counted a little I must confess for the time I have to pass here	86.55740356445312
No madame replied the novice only I thought I had chosen my time ill you were asleep you are fatigued	107.92984008789062
Well said Milady what can those who sleep wish fora happy awakening This awakening you have given me allow me then to enjoy it at my ease and taking her hand she drew her toward the armchair by the bedside	70.81854248046875
The novice sat down	117.93897247314453
How unfortunate I am said she I have been here six months without the shadow of recreation	137.9538116455078
You arrive and your presence was likely to afford me delightful company yet I expect in all probability to quit the convent at any moment	313.7342224121094
How you are going soon asked Milady	427.83831787109375
At least I hope so said the novice with an expression of joy which she made no effort to disguise	346.87359619140625
I think I learned you had suffered persecutions from the cardinal continued Milady that would have been another motive for sympathy between us	76.3345718383789
What I have heard then from our good mother is true you have likewise been a victim of that wicked priest	10694.1435546875
Hush said Milady let us not even here speak thus of him	134.9835968017578
All my misfortunes arise from my having said nearly what you have said before a woman whom I thought my friend and who betrayed me	50.7796745300293
Are you also the victim of a treachery	134.02935791015625
No said the novice but of my devotionof a devotion to a woman I loved for whom I would have laid down my life for whom I would give it still	87.88741302490234
And who has abandoned youis that it	1669.2772216796875
I have been sufficiently unjust to believe so but during the last two or three days I have obtained proof to the contrary for which I thank Godfor it would have cost me very dear to think she had forgotten me	282.7931823730469
But you madame you appear to be free continued the novice and if you were inclined to fly it only rests with yourself to do so	341.0388488769531
Whither would you have me go without friends without money in a part of France with which I am unacquainted and where I have never been before	46.364463806152344
Oh cried the novice as to friends you would have them wherever you want you appear so good and are so beautiful	135.0761260986328
That does not prevent replied Milady softening her smile so as to give it an angelic expression my being alone or being persecuted	368.9162902832031
Hear me said the novice we must trust in heaven	104.1650390625
There always comes a moment when the good you have done pleads your cause before God and see perhaps it is a happiness for you humble and powerless as I am that you have met with me for if I leave this place wellI have powerful friends who after having exerted themselves on my account may also exert themselves for you	431.4378356933594
Oh when I said I was alone said Milady hoping to make the novice talk by talking of herself it is not for want of friends in high places but these friends themselves tremble before the cardinal	22.490734100341797
The queen herself does not dare to oppose the terrible minister	173.0543975830078
I have proof that her Majesty notwithstanding her excellent heart has more than once been obliged to abandon to the anger of his Eminence persons who had served her	51.850013732910156
Trust me madame the queen may appear to have abandoned those persons but we must not put faith in appearances	57.07637023925781
The more they are persecuted the more she thinks of them and often when they least expect it they have proof of a kind remembrance	53.081703186035156
Alas said Milady I believe so the queen is so good	92.06687927246094
Oh you know her then that lovely and noble queen that you speak of her thus cried the novice with enthusiasm	471.51434326171875
That is to say replied Milady driven into her entrenchment that I have not the honor of knowing her personally but I know a great number of her most intimate friends	53.3990364074707
I am acquainted with Monsieur de Putange I met Monsieur Dujart in England I know Monsieur de Trville	495.6708679199219
Monsieur de Trville exclaimed the novice do you know Monsieur de Trville	139.37094116210938
Yes perfectly wellintimately even	35.034446716308594
The captain of the kings Musketeers	189.66888427734375
The captain of the kings Musketeers	258.6195373535156
Why then only see cried the novice we shall soon be well acquainted almost friends	1430.6953125
If you know Monsieur de Trville you must have visited him	294.2259826660156
Often said Milady who having entered this track and perceiving that falsehood succeeded was determined to follow it to the end	248.77517700195312
With him then you must have seen some of his Musketeers	105.80110931396484
All those he is in the habit of receiving replied Milady for whom this conversation began to have a real interest	50.81193923950195
Name a few of those whom you know and you will see if they are my friends	185.63255310058594
Well said Milady embarrassed I know Monsieur de Louvigny Monsieur de Courtivron Monsieur de Ferussac	301.2828063964844
The novice let her speak then seeing that she paused she said Do nt you know a gentleman named Athos	21.292753219604492
Milady became as pale as the sheets in which she was lying and mistress as she was of herself could not help uttering a cry seizing the hand of the novice and devouring her with looks	132.9725799560547
What is the matter Good God asked the poor woman have I said anything that has wounded you	638.4972534179688
No but the name struck me because I also have known that gentleman and it appeared strange to me to meet with a person who appears to know him well	203.19229125976562
Oh yes very well not only him but some of his friends Messieurs Porthos and Aramis	54.9010124206543
Indeed you know them likewise I know them cried Milady who began to feel a chill penetrate her heart	423.9748229980469
Well if you know them you know that they are good and free companions	88.20960235595703
Why do you not apply to them if you stand in need of help	253.974609375
That is to say stammered Milady I am not really very intimate with any of them	46.98420715332031
I know them from having heard one of their friends Monsieur dArtagnan say a great deal about them	6671.03662109375
You know Monsieur dArtagnan cried the novice in her turn seizing the hands of Milady and devouring her with her eyes	253.80003356933594
Then remarking the strange expression of Miladys countenance she said Pardon me madame you know him by what title	36.726844787597656
Why replied Milady embarrassed why by the title of friend	176.2141571044922
You deceive me madame said the novice you have been his mistress	274.94903564453125
It is you who have been his mistress madame cried Milady in her turn	25.769134521484375
I said the novice	100.07178497314453
Yes you I know you now	35.39022445678711
You are Madame Bonacieux	205.30795288085938
The young woman drew back filled with surprise and terror	439.62213134765625
Oh do not deny it Answer continued Milady	79.82852172851562
Well yes madame said the novice Are we rivals	233.5101776123047
The countenance of Milady was illumined by so savage a joy that under any other circumstances Mme	204.946533203125
Bonacieux would have fled in terror but she was absorbed by jealousy	351.70306396484375
Speak madame resumed Mme	80.03033447265625
Bonacieux with an energy of which she might not have been believed capable	81.86438751220703
Have you been or are you his mistress	127.89574432373047
Oh no cried Milady with an accent that admitted no doubt of her truth	24.960128784179688
Never never	688.7568359375
I believe you said Mme	60.70732116699219
Bonacieux but why then did you cry out so	6.359898567199707
Do you not understand said Milady who had already overcome her agitation and recovered all her presence of mind	204.19903564453125
How can I understand I know nothing	552.74755859375
Can you not understand that Monsieur dArtagnan being my friend might take me into his confidence	307.0154724121094
Do you not perceive that I know allyour abduction from the little house at St	44.46950149536133
Germain his despair that of his friends and their useless inquiries up to this moment How could I help being astonished when without having the least expectation of such a thing I meet you face to faceyou of whom we have so often spoken together you whom he loves with all his soul you whom he had taught me to love before I had seen you Ah dear Constance I have found you then I see you at last	4162.10986328125
And Milady stretched out her arms to Mme	34.748992919921875
Bonacieux who convinced by what she had just said saw nothing in this woman whom an instant before she had believed her rival but a sincere and devoted friend	30.761716842651367
Oh pardon me pardon me cried she sinking upon the shoulders of Milady	83.1388931274414
Pardon me I love him so much	53.06259536743164
These two women held each other for an instant in a close embrace	132.7705841064453
Certainly if Miladys strength had been equal to her hatred Mme	1116.6802978515625
Bonacieux would never have left that embrace alive	181.24566650390625
But not being able to stifle her she smiled upon her	74.80113983154297
Oh you beautiful good little creature said Milady	514.0125122070312
How delighted I am to have found you Let me look at you and while saying these words she absolutely devoured her by her looks	123.81978607177734
Oh yes it is you indeed From what he has told me I know you now	88.6253433227539
I recognize you perfectly	4.216803550720215
The poor young woman could not possibly suspect what frightful cruelty was behind the rampart of that pure brow behind those brilliant eyes in which she read nothing but interest and compassion	1607.526611328125
Then you know what I have suffered said Mme	94.29977416992188
Bonacieux since he has told you what he has suffered but to suffer for him is happiness	83.65814208984375
Milady replied mechanically Yes that is happiness	667.7503051757812
She was thinking of something else	102.0548324584961
And then continued Mme	66.27952575683594
Bonacieux my punishment is drawing to a close	48.99568557739258
Tomorrow this evening perhaps I shall see him again and then the past will no longer exist	165.71644592285156
This evening asked Milady roused from her reverie by these words	73.14933013916016
What do you mean Do you expect news from him	19.506704330444336
I expect himself	101.54940032958984
Himself DArtagnan here	48.36053466796875
But that s impossible He is at the siege of La Rochelle with the cardinal	47.50083541870117
He will not return till after the taking of the city	173.4122314453125
Ah you fancy so But is there anything impossible for my DArtagnan the noble and loyal gentleman	923.8594360351562
Oh I can not believe you	33.876861572265625
Well read then said the unhappy young woman in the excess of her pride and joy presenting a letter to Milady	340.97625732421875
The writing of Madame de Chevreuse said Milady to herself	18.745361328125
Ah I always thought there was some secret understanding in that quarter And she greedily read the following few lines	2.000459671020508
MY DEAR CHILD Hold yourself ready	3565.1513671875
Our friend will see you soon and he will only see you to release you from that imprisonment in which your safety required you should be concealed	49.737789154052734
Prepare then for your departure and never despair of us	26.386919021606445
Our charming Gascon has just proved himself as brave and faithful as ever	33.87712860107422
Tell him that certain parties are grateful for the warning he has given	78.53121948242188
Yes yes said Milady the letter is precise	14.319255828857422
Do you know what that warning was	483.6593017578125
No I only suspect he has warned the queen against some fresh machinations of the cardinal	471.4001770019531
Yes that s it no doubt said Milady returning the letter to Mme	60.032283782958984
Bonacieux and letting her head sink pensively upon her bosom	64.122314453125
At that moment they heard the gallop of a horse	85.03660583496094
Oh cried Mme	74.64429473876953
Bonacieux darting to the window can it be he	425.5501708984375
Milady remained still in bed petrified by surprise so many unexpected things happened to her all at once that for the first time she was at a loss	136.6620330810547
He he murmured she can it be he And she remained in bed with her eyes fixed	81.92019653320312
Alas no said Mme	29.646265029907227
Bonacieux it is a man I do nt know although he seems to be coming here	69.46316528320312
Yes he checks his pace he stops at the gate he rings	31.856386184692383
Milady sprang out of bed	160.98330688476562
You are sure it is not he said she	550.9439697265625
Yes yes very sure	782.1924438476562
Perhaps you did not see well	78.28599548339844
Oh if I were to see the plume of his hat the end of his cloak I should know him	206.8263702392578
Milady was dressing herself all the time	52.79407501220703
Yes he has entered	229.8351287841797
It is for you or me	47.4681396484375
My God how agitated you seem	300.58624267578125
Yes I admit it	64.71477508544922
I have not your confidence I fear the cardinal	63.69497299194336
Hush said Mme	91.12187957763672
Bonacieux somebody is coming	297.33416748046875
Immediately the door opened and the superior entered	69.38536834716797
Did you come from Boulogne demanded she of Milady	29.933897018432617
Yes replied she trying to recover her selfpossession	56.314735412597656
Who wants me	71.78506469726562
A man who will not tell his name but who comes from the cardinal	49.9793586730957
And who wishes to speak with me	117.88944244384766
Who wishes to speak to a lady recently come from Boulogne	54.55614471435547
Then let him come in if you please	96.48567962646484
Oh my God my God cried Mme	91.04096984863281
Can it be bad news	437.85516357421875
I fear it	287.818115234375
I will leave you with this stranger but as soon as he is gone if you will permit me I will return	65.27896881103516
Permit you I beseech you	37.308841705322266
The superior and Mme	880.8148803710938
Bonacieux retired	162.57203674316406
Milady remained alone with her eyes fixed upon the door	111.38978576660156
An instant later the jingling of spurs was heard upon the stairs steps drew near the door opened and a man appeared	110.0361099243164
Milady uttered a cry of joy this man was the Comte de Rochefortthe demoniacal tool of his Eminence	41.4149169921875
Chapter LXII	246.60321044921875
TWO VARIETIES OF DEMONS	165.95477294921875
Ah cried Milady and Rochefort together it is you	62.99662780761719
Yes it is I	89.01592254638672
And you come asked Milady	76.13775634765625
From La Rochelle and you	44.87488555908203
From England	119.6544418334961
Dead or desperately wounded as I left without having been able to hear anything of him	207.10061645507812
A fanatic has just assassinated him	22425.904296875
Ah said Rochefort with a smile this is a fortunate chanceone that will delight his Eminence Have you informed him of it	61.322509765625
I wrote to him from Boulogne	682.263427734375
But what brings you here	21295.52734375
His Eminence was uneasy and sent me to find you	144.19529724121094
I only arrived yesterday	168.89434814453125
And what have you been doing since yesterday	358.0248107910156
I have not lost my time	2351.213134765625
Oh I do nt doubt that	24.163000106811523
Do you know whom I have encountered here	532.0457763671875
How can I	309.261474609375
That young woman whom the queen took out of prison	153.5614013671875
The mistress of that fellow DArtagnan	1.679030418395996
Yes Madame Bonacieux with whose retreat the cardinal was unacquainted	66.97855377197266
Well well said Rochefort here is a chance which may pair off with the other Monsieur Cardinal is indeed a privileged man	140.81222534179688
Imagine my astonishment continued Milady when I found myself face to face with this woman	50.873409271240234
Does she know you	146.22373962402344
Then she looks upon you as a stranger	53.77614212036133
Milady smiled	103.85135650634766
I am her best friend	54.53605270385742
Upon my honor said Rochefort it takes you my dear countess to perform such miracles	283.473876953125
And it is well I can Chevalier said Milady for do you know what is going on here	118.04003143310547
They will come for her tomorrow or the day after with an order from the queen	196.86485290527344
Indeed And who	104.64325714111328
DArtagnan and his friends	790.8626708984375
Indeed they will go so far that we shall be obliged to send them to the Bastille	172.45050048828125
Why is it not done already	137.23977661132812
What would you The cardinal has a weakness for these men which I can not comprehend	49.18381118774414
Well then tell him this Rochefort	93.65492248535156
Tell him that our conversation at the inn of the Red Dovecot was overheard by these four men tell him that after his departure one of them came up to me and took from me by violence the safeconduct which he had given me tell him they warned Lord de Winter of my journey to England that this time they nearly foiled my mission as they foiled the affair of the studs tell him that among these four men two only are to be fearedDArtagnan and Athos tell him that the third Aramis is the lover of Madame de Chevreusehe may be left alone we know his secret and it may be useful as to the fourth Porthos he is a fool a simpleton a blustering booby not worth troubling himself about	185.32000732421875
But these four men must be now at the siege of La Rochelle	74.0866928100586
I thought so too but a letter which Madame Bonacieux has received from Madame the Constable and which she has had the imprudence to show me leads me to believe that these four men on the contrary are on the road hither to take her away	49.99928283691406
The devil What s to be done	114.41649627685547
What did the cardinal say about me	67.98016357421875
I was to take your dispatches written or verbal and return by post and when he shall know what you have done he will advise what you have to do	335.410888671875
I must then remain here	23.261491775512695
Here or in the neighborhood	317.8304443359375
You can not take me with you	68.53297424316406
No the order is imperative	27.353796005249023
Near the camp you might be recognized and your presence you must be aware would compromise the cardinal	20.6547794342041
Then I must wait here or in the neighborhood	167.05384826660156
Only tell me beforehand where you will wait for intelligence from the cardinal let me know always where to find you	92.40386199951172
Observe it is probable that I may not be able to remain here	19.943931579589844
You forget that my enemies may arrive at any minute	76.3800048828125
That s true but is this little woman then to escape his Eminence	205.24609375
Bah said Milady with a smile that belonged only to herself you forget that I am her best friend	84.65392303466797
Ah that s true I may then tell the cardinal with respect to this little woman	117.85487365722656
That he may be at ease	112.69673919677734
Is that all	84.09781646728516
He will know what that means	83.50405883789062
He will guess at least	14367.4228515625
Now then what had I better do	1285.39404296875
Return instantly	144.54360961914062
It appears to me that the news you bear is worth the trouble of a little diligence	629.546142578125
My chaise broke down coming into Lilliers	100.87042236328125
What capital	73.9734115600586
Yes I want your chaise	22.77398681640625
And how shall I travel then	13.891267776489258
On horseback	110.73300170898438
You talk very comfortablya hundred and eighty leagues	81.03473663330078
What s that	47.43174743652344
One can do it Afterward	545.6593017578125
Afterward Why in passing through Lilliers you will send me your chaise with an order to your servant to place himself at my disposal	486.35150146484375
You have no doubt some order from the cardinal about you	201.25880432128906
I have my full power	9584.421875
Show it to the abbess and tell her that someone will come and fetch me either today or tomorrow and that I am to follow the person who presents himself in your name	64566.0
Very well	10.520212173461914
Do nt forget to treat me harshly in speaking of me to the abbess	9.78794002532959
To what purpose	65.43551635742188
I am a victim of the cardinal	78.17222595214844
It is necessary to inspire confidence in that poor little Madame Bonacieux	108.72962951660156
That s true	2.000459671020508
Now will you make me a report of all that has happened	349.5657958984375
Why I have related the events to you	198.41152954101562
You have a good memory repeat what I have told you	2808.130615234375
A paper may be lost	252.1907501220703
You are right only let me know where to find you that I may not run needlessly about the neighborhood	197.8622283935547
That s correct wait	276.37060546875
Do you want a map	23.785921096801758
Oh I know this country marvelously	116.6278305053711
You When were you here	31.48933982849121
I was brought up here	11.371347427368164
It is worth something you see to have been brought up somewhere	98.12444305419922
You will wait for me then	77.40552520751953
Let me reflect a little Ay that will doat Armentires	91.28121948242188
Where is that Armentires	227.8273162841797
A little town on the Lys I shall only have to cross the river and I shall be in a foreign country	10.902705192565918
Capital but it is understood you will only cross the river in case of danger	102.56546783447266
That is well understood	73.10116577148438
And in that case how shall I know where you are	45.411216735839844
You do not want your lackey	73.99446868896484
Is he a sure man	75.39216613769531
To the proof	17.57363510131836
Give him to me	97.4277114868164
Nobody knows him	85.4180908203125
I will leave him at the place I quit and he will conduct you to me	30.812416076660156
And you say you will wait for me at Armentires	71.42463684082031
At Armentires	227.171875
Write that name on a bit of paper lest I should forget it	216.655029296875
There is nothing compromising in the name of a town	4742.041015625
Is it not so	6.157480716705322
Eh who knows Never mind said Milady writing the name on half a sheet of paper I will compromise myself	116524.671875
Well said Rochefort taking the paper from Milady folding it and placing it in the lining of his hat you may be easy	84.41429138183594
I will do as children do for fear of losing the paperrepeat the name along the route	3579.5625
Now is that all	124.28614807128906
I believe so	60.63982391357422
Let us see Buckingham dead or grievously wounded your conversation with the cardinal overheard by the four Musketeers Lord de Winter warned of your arrival at Portsmouth DArtagnan and Athos to the Bastille Aramis the lover of Madame de Chevreuse Porthos an ass Madame Bonacieux found again to send you the chaise as soon as possible to place my lackey at your disposal to make you out a victim of the cardinal in order that the abbess may entertain no suspicion Armentires on the banks of the Lys	105.25971984863281
Is that all then	38.17045211791992
In truth my dear Chevalier you are a miracle of memory	73.98236846923828
A propos add one thing	95.70601654052734
I saw some very pretty woods which almost touch the convent garden	289.45013427734375
Say that I am permitted to walk in those woods	39.004722595214844
Who knows Perhaps I shall stand in need of a back door for retreat	174.13710021972656
You think of everything	67.1279296875
And you forget one thing	5.982715606689453
To ask me if I want money	77.53766632080078
That s true	517.9666137695312
How much do you want	585.2116088867188
All you have in gold	166.87225341796875
I have five hundred pistoles or thereabouts	412.55731201171875
I have as much	235.27001953125
With a thousand pistoles one may face everything	15.121648788452148
Empty your pockets	259.8760986328125
And you go	199.30809020996094
In an hourtime to eat a morsel during which I shall send for a post horse	178.3700408935547
Capital Adieu Chevalier	59.42436981201172
Adieu Countess	1269.9306640625
Commend me to the cardinal	49.671531677246094
Commend me to Satan	155.97555541992188
Milady and Rochefort exchanged a smile and separated	105.17151641845703
An hour afterward Rochefort set out at a grand gallop five hours after that he passed through Arras	27.425857543945312
Our readers already know how he was recognized by DArtagnan and how that recognition by inspiring fear in the four Musketeers had given fresh activity to their journey	32.91474914550781
Chapter LXIII	99.13652801513672
THE DROP OF WATER	72.39041900634766
Rochefort had scarcely departed when Mme	169.2598114013672
Bonacieux reentered	846.9987182617188
She found Milady with a smiling countenance	118.44660186767578
Well said the young woman what you dreaded has happened	6.417022228240967
This evening or tomorrow the cardinal will send someone to take you away	178.57496643066406
Who told you that my dear asked Milady	274.7134094238281
I heard it from the mouth of the messenger himself	78.06963348388672
Come and sit down close to me said Milady	323.1010437011719
Here I am	204.4094696044922
Wait till I assure myself that nobody hears us	63.17534255981445
Why all these precautions	85.78267669677734
You shall know	188.28414916992188
Milady arose went to the door opened it looked in the corridor and then returned and seated herself close to Mme	101.01154327392578
Then said she he has well played his part	2263.230224609375
Who has	122.85780334472656
He who just now presented himself to the abbess as a messenger from the cardinal	294.2945861816406
It was then a part he was playing	113.39739227294922
Yes my child	326.1678771972656
That man then was not	39.731903076171875
That man said Milady lowering her voice is my brother	23.037805557250977
Your brother cried Mme	115.77741241455078
No one must know this secret my dear but yourself	164.73681640625
If you reveal it to anyone in the world I shall be lost and perhaps yourself likewise	96.38556671142578
Oh my God	98.3333969116211
This is what has happened My brother who was coming to my assistance to take me away by force if it were necessary met with the emissary of the cardinal who was coming in search of me	320.9604797363281
He followed him	489.1825256347656
At a solitary and retired part of the road he drew his sword and required the messenger to deliver up to him the papers of which he was the bearer	6.462138652801514
The messenger resisted my brother killed him	108.84083557128906
Oh said Mme	356.7193298339844
Bonacieux shuddering	492.7477722167969
Remember that was the only means	100.48942565917969
Then my brother determined to substitute cunning for force	145.7706756591797
He took the papers and presented himself here as the emissary of the cardinal and in an hour or two a carriage will come to take me away by the orders of his Eminence	136.3804168701172
I understand	68.36015319824219
It is your brother who sends this carriage	43.033058166503906
Exactly but that is not all	43.033058166503906
That letter you have received and which you believe to be from Madame de Chevreuse	77.43505859375
It is a forgery	72.570068359375
How can that be	90.11702728271484
Yes a forgery it is a snare to prevent your making any resistance when they come to fetch you	94.13103485107422
But it is DArtagnan that will come	41.56751251220703
Do not deceive yourself	127.04690551757812
DArtagnan and his friends are detained at the siege of La Rochelle	461.372314453125
How do you know that	1162.2421875
My brother met some emissaries of the cardinal in the uniform of Musketeers	335.32928466796875
You would have been summoned to the gate you would have believed yourself about to meet friends you would have been abducted and conducted back to Paris	177.5498046875
Oh my God My senses fail me amid such a chaos of iniquities	522.2695922851562
I feel if this continues said Mme	264.5982666015625
Bonacieux raising her hands to her forehead I shall go mad	764.3688354492188
I hear a horses steps it is my brother setting off again	149.5385284423828
I should like to offer him a last salute	442.4785461425781
Milady opened the window and made a sign to Mme	93.85704803466797
Bonacieux to join her	185.68894958496094
The young woman complied	1223.7777099609375
Rochefort passed at a gallop	94.3656234741211
Adieu brother cried Milady	517.5977783203125
The chevalier raised his head saw the two young women and without stopping waved his hand in a friendly way to Milady	2020.935302734375
The good George said she closing the window with an expression of countenance full of affection and melancholy	177.66134643554688
And she resumed her seat as if plunged in reflections entirely personal	62.80796432495117
Dear lady said Mme	37.401634216308594
Bonacieux pardon me for interrupting you but what do you advise me to do Good heaven You have more experience than I have	544.5283813476562
Speak I will listen	34.1391487121582
In the first place said Milady it is possible I may be deceived and that DArtagnan and his friends may really come to your assistance	266.83660888671875
Oh that would be too much cried Mme	63.7714958190918
Bonacieux so much happiness is not in store for me	125.96466064453125
Then you comprehend it would be only a question of time a sort of race which should arrive first	207.35317993164062
If your friends are the more speedy you are to be saved if the satellites of the cardinal you are lost	30.812416076660156
Oh yes yes lost beyond redemption What then to do What to do	292.61126708984375
There would be a very simple means very natural	99.69053649902344
Tell me what	34.812957763671875
To wait concealed in the neighborhood and assure yourself who are the men who come to ask for you	111.37374114990234
But where can I wait	320.3462829589844
Oh there is no difficulty in that	163.22366333007812
I shall stop and conceal myself a few leagues hence until my brother can rejoin me	190.13722229003906
Well I take you with me we conceal ourselves and wait together	22.07467269897461
But I shall not be allowed to go I am almost a prisoner	149.91384887695312
As they believe that I go in consequence of an order from the cardinal no one will believe you anxious to follow me	70.2343978881836
Well The carriage is at the door you bid me adieu you mount the step to embrace me a last time my brothers servant who comes to fetch me is told how to proceed he makes a sign to the postillion and we set off at a gallop	152.2030792236328
But DArtagnan DArtagnan if he comes	207.23585510253906
Shall we not know it	66.84320831298828
Nothing easier	45.235836029052734
We will send my brothers servant back to Bthune whom as I told you we can trust	113.62689208984375
He shall assume a disguise and place himself in front of the convent	68.70333862304688
If the emissaries of the cardinal arrive he will take no notice if it is Monsieur dArtagnan and his friends he will bring them to us	245.34222412109375
He knows them then	204.59043884277344
Has he not seen Monsieur dArtagnan at my house	206.52627563476562
Oh yes yes you are right	99.37767028808594
Thus all may go wellall may be for the best but we do not go far from this place	388.7303466796875
Seven or eight leagues at the most	182.99229431152344
We will keep on the frontiers for instance and at the first alarm we can leave France	217.79212951660156
And what can we do there	445.4306335449219
But if they come	354.266845703125
My brothers carriage will be here first	122.27534484863281
If I should happen to be any distance from you when the carriage comes for youat dinner or supper for instance	303.0567626953125
Do one thing	1280.2344970703125
What is that	191.71923828125
Tell your good superior that in order that we may be as much together as possible you ask her permission to share my repast	132.8009796142578
Will she permit it	221.82249450683594
What inconvenience can it be	89.81609344482422
Oh delightful In this way we shall not be separated for an instant	432.3744812011719
Well go down to her then to make your request	969.417724609375
I feel my head a little confused I will take a turn in the garden	303.8007507324219
Go and where shall I find you	13.2869291305542
Here in an hour	129.46783447265625
Here in an hour	344.99493408203125
Oh you are so kind and I am so grateful	33.931880950927734
How can I avoid interesting myself for one who is so beautiful and so amiable Are you not the beloved of one of my best friends	115.35814666748047
Dear DArtagnan Oh how he will thank you	125.43803405761719
I hope so	105.07747650146484
Now then all is agreed let us go down	193.0184783935547
You are going into the garden	194.65435791015625
Go along this corridor down a little staircase and you are in it	255.8776092529297
Excellent thank you	82.14142608642578
And the two women parted exchanging charming smiles	310.4366760253906
Milady had told the truthher head was confused for her illarranged plans clashed one another like chaos	19.506704330444336
She required to be alone that she might put her thoughts a little into order	21.374296188354492
She saw vaguely the future but she stood in need of a little silence and quiet to give all her ideas as yet confused a distinct form and a regular plan	61.31119918823242
What was most pressing was to get Mme	632.1116943359375
Bonacieux away and convey her to a place of safety and there if matters required make her a hostage	105.88792419433594
Milady began to have doubts of the issue of this terrible duel in which her enemies showed as much perseverance as she did animosity	208.4195098876953
Besides she felt as we feel when a storm is coming onthat this issue was near and could not fail to be terrible	216.09921264648438
The principal thing for her then was as we have said to keep Mme	107.40392303466797
Bonacieux in her power	280.1368408203125
Bonacieux was the very life of DArtagnan	293.49285888671875
This was more than his life the life of the woman he loved this was in case of ill fortune a means of temporizing and obtaining good conditions	22.02190589904785
Now this point was settled Mme	93.38331604003906
Bonacieux without any suspicion accompanied her	26.072071075439453
Once concealed with her at Armentires it would be easy to make her believe that DArtagnan had not come to Bthune	111.66488647460938
In fifteen days at most Rochefort would be back besides during that fifteen days she would have time to think how she could best avenge herself on the four friends	177.6508331298828
She would not be weary thank God for she should enjoy the sweetest pastime such events could accord a woman of her characterperfecting a beautiful vengeance	208.48211669921875
Revolving all this in her mind she cast her eyes around her and arranged the topography of the garden in her head	351.75958251953125
Milady was like a good general who contemplates at the same time victory and defeat and who is quite prepared according to the chances of the battle to march forward or to beat a retreat	460.09149169921875
At the end of an hour she heard a soft voice calling her it was Mme	520.5307006835938
The good abbess had naturally consented to her request and as a commencement they were to sup together	140.3098602294922
On reaching the courtyard they heard the noise of a carriage which stopped at the gate	49.52702331542969
Milady listened	241.00439453125
Do you hear anything said she	25.57603645324707
Yes the rolling of a carriage	159.25094604492188
It is the one my brother sends for us	70.97090148925781
Oh my God	232.15777587890625
Come come courage	77.6834716796875
The bell of the convent gate was sounded Milady was not mistaken	111.29267883300781
Go to your chamber said she to Mme	51.43020248413086
Bonacieux you have perhaps some jewels you would like to take	153.5271453857422
I have his letters said she	64.2806396484375
Well go and fetch them and come to my apartment	83.71085357666016
We will snatch some supper we shall perhaps travel part of the night and must keep our strength up	182.40042114257812
Great God said Mme	48.905643463134766
Bonacieux placing her hand upon her bosom my heart beats so I can not walk	279.75067138671875
Courage courage remember that in a quarter of an hour you will be safe and think that what you are about to do is for his sake	49.5688591003418
Yes yes everything for him	25.004526138305664
You have restored my courage by a single word go I will rejoin you	105.4606704711914
Milady ran up to her apartment quickly she there found Rocheforts lackey and gave him his instructions	232.34463500976562
He was to wait at the gate if by chance the Musketeers should appear the carriage was to set off as fast as possible pass around the convent and go and wait for Milady at a little village which was situated at the other side of the wood	71.45897674560547
In this case Milady would cross the garden and gain the village on foot	471.7192687988281
As we have already said Milady was admirably acquainted with this part of France	201.1112518310547
If the Musketeers did not appear things were to go on as had been agreed Mme	697.5592041015625
Bonacieux was to get into the carriage as if to bid her adieu and she was to take away Mme	477.9260559082031
Bonacieux came in and to remove all suspicion if she had any Milady repeated to the lackey before her the latter part of her instructions	202.79794311523438
Milady asked some questions about the carriage	131.89663696289062
It was a chaise drawn by three horses driven by a postillion Rocheforts lackey would precede it as courier	93.9622802734375
Milady was wrong in fearing that Mme	133.47901916503906
Bonacieux would have any suspicion	351.9720153808594
The poor young woman was too pure to suppose that any female could be guilty of such perfidy besides the name of the Comtesse de Winter which she had heard the abbess pronounce was wholly unknown to her and she was even ignorant that a woman had had so great and so fatal a share in the misfortune of her life	171.20021057128906
You see said she when the lackey had gone out everything is ready	348.5791015625
The abbess suspects nothing and believes that I am taken by order of the cardinal	555.4319458007812
This man goes to give his last orders take the least thing drink a finger of wine and let us be gone	88.75996398925781
Yes said Mme	84.10623931884766
Bonacieux mechanically yes let us be gone	40.20493698120117
Milady made her a sign to sit down opposite poured her a small glass of Spanish wine and helped her to the wing of a chicken	149.99464416503906
See said she if everything does not second us Here is night coming on by daybreak we shall have reached our retreat and nobody can guess where we are	120.7068099975586
Come courage take something	19.024200439453125
Bonacieux ate a few mouthfuls mechanically and just touched the glass with her lips	119.72035217285156
Come come said Milady lifting hers to her mouth do as I do	45.685585021972656
But at the moment the glass touched her lips her hand remained suspended she heard something on the road which sounded like the rattling of a distant gallop	346.1488952636719
Then it grew nearer and it seemed to her almost at the same time that she heard the neighing of horses	175.4541015625
This noise acted upon her joy like the storm which awakens the sleeper in the midst of a happy dream she grew pale and ran to the window while Mme	35.86159133911133
Bonacieux rising all in a tremble supported herself upon her chair to avoid falling	47.68156814575195
Nothing was yet to be seen only they heard the galloping draw nearer	49.797237396240234
Oh my God said Mme	19.974834442138672
Bonacieux what is that noise	1073.5977783203125
That of either our friends or our enemies said Milady with her terrible coolness	146.8102569580078
Stay where you are I will tell you	107.24506378173828
Bonacieux remained standing mute motionless and pale as a statue	13.432868957519531
The noise became louder the horses could not be more than a hundred and fifty paces distant	93.3624267578125
If they were not yet to be seen it was because the road made an elbow	217.65000915527344
The noise became so distinct that the horses might be counted by the rattle of their hoofs	588.3046875
Milady gazed with all the power of her attention it was just light enough for her to see who was coming	226.0157470703125
All at once at the turning of the road she saw the glitter of laced hats and the waving of feathers she counted two then five then eight horsemen	352.08380126953125
One of them preceded the rest by double the length of his horse	328.5914001464844
Milady uttered a stifled groan	153885.046875
In the first horseman she recognized DArtagnan	95.79545593261719
Oh my God my God cried Mme	13.432868957519531
Bonacieux what is it	32.74714660644531
It is the uniform of the cardinals Guards	60.205745697021484
Not an instant to be lost Fly fly	1037.9520263671875
Yes yes let us fly repeated Mme	120.04492950439453
Bonacieux but without being able to make a step glued as she was to the spot by terror	43.87322998046875
They heard the horsemen pass under the windows	142.55328369140625
Come then come then cried Milady trying to drag the young woman along by the arm	49.81880187988281
Thanks to the garden we yet can flee I have the key but make haste in five minutes it will be too late	23.06340789794922
Bonacieux tried to walk made two steps and sank upon her knees	889.259033203125
Milady tried to raise and carry her but could not do it	79.04199981689453
At this moment they heard the rolling of the carriage which at the approach of the Musketeers set off at a gallop	172.9282684326172
Then three or four shots were fired	120.5296630859375
For the last time will you come cried Milady	103.35781860351562
Oh my God my God you see my strength fails me you see plainly I can not walk	85.04707336425781
Flee alone	89.41073608398438
Flee alone and leave you here No no never cried Milady	432.3596496582031
All at once she paused a livid flash darted from her eyes she ran to the table emptied into Mme	21.21683120727539
Bonacieuxs glass the contents of a ring which she opened with singular quickness	123.61638641357422
It was a grain of a reddish color which dissolved immediately	98.71891784667969
Then taking the glass with a firm hand she said Drink	133.27403259277344
This wine will give you strength drink And she put the glass to the lips of the young woman who drank mechanically	270.7191162109375
This is not the way that I wished to avenge myself said Milady replacing the glass upon the table with an infernal smile but my faith we do what we can And she rushed out of the room	158.92901611328125
Bonacieux saw her go without being able to follow her she was like people who dream they are pursued and who in vain try to walk	93.19829559326172
A few moments passed a great noise was heard at the gate	56.30203628540039
Every instant Mme	106.3159408569336
Bonacieux expected to see Milady but she did not return	31.03800392150879
Several times with terror no doubt the cold sweat burst from her burning brow	112.67884063720703
At length she heard the grating of the hinges of the opening gates the noise of boots and spurs resounded on the stairs	287.22857666015625
There was a great murmur of voices which continued to draw near amid which she seemed to hear her own name pronounced	209.0626983642578
All at once she uttered a loud cry of joy and darted toward the door she had recognized the voice of DArtagnan	37.441680908203125
DArtagnan DArtagnan cried she is it you This way this way	15.839067459106445
Constance Constance replied the young man where are you where are you My God	51.70214080810547
At the same moment the door of the cell yielded to a shock rather than opened several men rushed into the chamber	599.9851684570312
Bonacieux had sunk into an armchair without the power of moving	217.927490234375
DArtagnan threw down a yetsmoking pistol which he held in his hand and fell on his knees before his mistress	298.51910400390625
Athos replaced his in his belt Porthos and Aramis who held their drawn swords in their hands returned them to their scabbards	104.2258071899414
Oh DArtagnan my beloved DArtagnan You have come then at last You have not deceived me It is indeed thee	147.2714080810547
Yes yes Constance	341.1842956542969
Oh it was in vain she told me you would not come I hoped in silence	116.80146789550781
I was not willing to fly	755.6766357421875
Oh I have done well How happy I am	146.18406677246094
At this word she Athos who had seated himself quietly started up	164.12313842773438
She What she asked DArtagnan	213.73085021972656
Why my companion	9.764701843261719
She who out of friendship for me wished to take me from my persecutors	512.5032348632812
She who mistaking you for the cardinals Guards has just fled away	85.21788787841797
Your companion cried DArtagnan becoming more pale than the white veil of his mistress	153.5994873046875
Of what companion are you speaking dear Constance	38.38623046875
Of her whose carriage was at the gate of a woman who calls herself your friend of a woman to whom you have told everything	142.20791625976562
Her name her name cried DArtagnan	189.2225341796875
My God can you not remember her name	203.31625366210938
Yes it was pronounced in my hearing once	186.65577697753906
Stopbutit is very strangeoh my God my head swims I can not see	320.1311340332031
Help help my friends her hands are icy cold cried DArtagnan	138.71873474121094
She is ill Great God she is losing her senses	68.10416412353516
While Porthos was calling for help with all the power of his strong voice Aramis ran to the table to get a glass of water but he stopped at seeing the horrible alteration that had taken place in the countenance of Athos who standing before the table his hair rising from his head his eyes fixed in stupor was looking at one of the glasses and appeared a prey to the most horrible doubt	67.98865509033203
Oh said Athos oh no it is impossible God would not permit such a crime	23.75160789489746
Water water cried DArtagnan	62.22380828857422
Oh poor woman poor woman murmured Athos in a broken voice	312.41748046875
Bonacieux opened her eyes under the kisses of DArtagnan	122.9128189086914
She revives cried the young man	75.76823425292969
Oh my God my God I thank thee	2.000459671020508
Madame said Athos madame in the name of heaven whose empty glass is this	187.76629638671875
Mine monsieur said the young woman in a dying voice	312.9150390625
But who poured the wine for you that was in this glass	61.145511627197266
But who is she	35.81816864013672
Oh I remember said Mme	88.15632629394531
Bonacieux the Comtesse de Winter	179.27696228027344
The four friends uttered one and the same cry but that of Athos dominated all the rest	13989.8095703125
At that moment the countenance of Mme	96.74795532226562
Bonacieux became livid a fearful agony pervaded her frame and she sank panting into the arms of Porthos and Aramis	52.0716552734375
DArtagnan seized the hands of Athos with an anguish difficult to be described	155.65940856933594
And what do you believe His voice was stifled by sobs	946.9630126953125
I believe everything said Athos biting his lips till the blood sprang to avoid sighing	103.4336929321289
DArtagnan DArtagnan cried Mme	35.82278823852539
Bonacieux where art thou Do not leave me You see I am dying	358.1749267578125
DArtagnan released the hands of Athos which he still held clasped in both his own and hastened to her	247.33546447753906
Her beautiful face was distorted with agony her glassy eyes had no longer their sight a convulsive shuddering shook her whole body the sweat rolled from her brow	120.60377502441406
In the name of heaven run call Aramis Porthos Call for help	286.4454040527344
Useless said Athos useless For the poison which she pours there is no antidote	297.9363708496094
Yes yes Help help murmured Mme	163.12071228027344
Bonacieux help	395.7716064453125
Then collecting all her strength she took the head of the young man between her hands looked at him for an instant as if her whole soul passed into that look and with a sobbing cry pressed her lips to his	88.36241912841797
Constance Constance cried DArtagnan	97.64476013183594
A sigh escaped from the mouth of Mme	164.87245178222656
Bonacieux and dwelt for an instant on the lips of DArtagnan	115.70736694335938
That sigh was the soul so chaste and so loving which reascended to heaven	302.92181396484375
DArtagnan pressed nothing but a corpse in his arms	951.3096313476562
The young man uttered a cry and fell by the side of his mistress as pale and as icy as herself	85.25495910644531
Porthos wept Aramis pointed toward heaven Athos made the sign of the cross	184.2518310546875
At that moment a man appeared in the doorway almost as pale as those in the chamber	202.4775390625
He looked around him and saw Mme	94.1533432006836
Bonacieux dead and DArtagnan in a swoon	548.2645263671875
He appeared just at that moment of stupor which follows great catastrophes	83.36946868896484
I was not deceived said he here is Monsieur dArtagnan and you are his friends Messieurs Athos Porthos and Aramis	505.96942138671875
The persons whose names were thus pronounced looked at the stranger with astonishment	748.2086791992188
It seemed to all three that they knew him	277.6957092285156
Gentlemen resumed the newcomer you are as I am in search of a woman who added he with a terrible smile must have passed this way for I see a corpse	56.8003044128418
The three friends remained mutefor although the voice as well as the countenance reminded them of someone they had seen they could not remember under what circumstances	122.52310180664062
Gentlemen continued the stranger since you do not recognize a man who probably owes his life to you twice I must name myself	62.15741729736328
I am Lord de Winter brotherinlaw of that woman	251.6349334716797
The three friends uttered a cry of surprise	186.11692810058594
Athos rose and offering him his hand Be welcome my Lord said he you are one of us	167.61732482910156
I set out five hours after her from Portsmouth said Lord de Winter	425.7703857421875
I arrived three hours after her at Boulogne	128.00238037109375
I missed her by twenty minutes at St	72.89138793945312
Finally at Lilliers I lost all trace of her	81.73524475097656
I was going about at random inquiring of everybody when I saw you gallop past	300.30731201171875
I recognized Monsieur dArtagnan	1036.6744384765625
I called to you but you did not answer me I wished to follow you but my horse was too much fatigued to go at the same pace with yours	281.1678466796875
And yet it appears in spite of all your diligence you have arrived too late	79.05851745605469
You see said Athos pointing to Mme	34.63916015625
Bonacieux dead and to DArtagnan whom Porthos and Aramis were trying to recall to life	151.10304260253906
Are they both dead asked Lord de Winter sternly	309.22979736328125
No replied Athos fortunately Monsieur dArtagnan has only fainted	105.56753540039062
Ah indeed so much the better said Lord de Winter	59.053932189941406
At that moment DArtagnan opened his eyes	149.96762084960938
He tore himself from the arms of Porthos and Aramis and threw himself like a madman on the corpse of his mistress	231.40237426757812
Athos rose walked toward his friend with a slow and solemn step embraced him tenderly and as he burst into violent sobs he said to him with his noble and persuasive voice Friend be a man Women weep for the dead men avenge them	105.88121032714844
Oh yes cried DArtagnan yes If it be to avenge her I am ready to follow you	93.96814727783203
Athos profited by this moment of strength which the hope of vengeance restored to his unfortunate friend to make a sign to Porthos and Aramis to go and fetch the superior	95.83657836914062
The two friends met her in the corridor greatly troubled and much upset by such strange events she called some of the nuns who against all monastic custom found themselves in the presence of five men	88.78256225585938
Madame said Athos passing his arm under that of DArtagnan we abandon to your pious care the body of that unfortunate woman	142.2113037109375
She was an angel on earth before being an angel in heaven	701.3851318359375
Treat her as one of your sisters	49.69367218017578
We will return someday to pray over her grave	307.9851379394531
DArtagnan concealed his face in the bosom of Athos and sobbed aloud	53.26692199707031
Weep said Athos weep heart full of love youth and life Alas would I could weep like you	69.38937377929688
And he drew away his friend as affectionate as a father as consoling as a priest noble as a man who has suffered much	120.8927001953125
All five followed by their lackeys leading their horses took their way to the town of Bthune whose outskirts they perceived and stopped before the first inn they came to	172.1183624267578
But said DArtagnan shall we not pursue that woman	141.2899627685547
Later said Athos	48.85260772705078
I have measures to take	73.65287780761719
She will escape us replied the young man she will escape us and it will be your fault Athos	49.95465087890625
I will be accountable for her said Athos	402.2578125
DArtagnan had so much confidence in the word of his friend that he lowered his head and entered the inn without reply	134.59507751464844
Porthos and Aramis regarded each other not understanding this assurance of Athos	72.32645416259766
Lord de Winter believed he spoke in this manner to soothe the grief of DArtagnan	62.84588623046875
Now gentlemen said Athos when he had ascertained there were five chambers free in the htel let everyone retire to his own apartment	167.44949340820312
DArtagnan needs to be alone to weep and to sleep	278.99267578125
I take charge of everything be easy	16.703786849975586
It appears however said Lord de Winter if there are any measures to take against the countess it concerns me she is my sisterinlaw	34.63916015625
And me said Athos she is my wife	253.35531616210938
DArtagnan smiledfor he understood that Athos was sure of his vengeance when he revealed such a secret	90.09954071044922
Porthos and Aramis looked at each other and grew pale	139.0345458984375
Lord de Winter thought Athos was mad	163.059814453125
Now retire to your chambers said Athos and leave me to act	192.0045928955078
You must perceive that in my quality of a husband this concerns me	80.42716979980469
Only DArtagnan if you have not lost it give me the paper which fell from that mans hat upon which is written the name of the village of	350.4396667480469
Ah said DArtagnan I comprehend that name written in her hand	83.6617660522461
You see then said Athos there is a god in heaven still	48.62214279174805
Chapter LXIV	95.38728332519531
THE MAN IN THE RED CLOAK	87.17237091064453
The despair of Athos had given place to a concentrated grief which only rendered more lucid the brilliant mental faculties of that extraordinary man	366.4819641113281
Possessed by one single thoughtthat of the promise he had made and of the responsibility he had takenhe retired last to his chamber begged the host to procure him a map of the province bent over it examined every line traced upon it perceived that there were four different roads from Bthune to Armentires and summoned the lackeys	144.14881896972656
Planchet Grimaud Bazin and Mousqueton presented themselves and received clear positive and serious orders from Athos	653.7893676757812
They must set out the next morning at daybreak and go to Armentireseach by a different route	2.000459671020508
Planchet the most intelligent of the four was to follow that by which the carriage had gone upon which the four friends had fired and which was accompanied as may be remembered by Rocheforts servant	400.59649658203125
Athos set the lackeys to work first because since these men had been in the service of himself and his friends he had discovered in each of them different and essential qualities	33.49468994140625
Then lackeys who ask questions inspire less mistrust than masters and meet with more sympathy among those to whom they address themselves	108.71749114990234
Besides Milady knew the masters and did not know the lackeys on the contrary the lackeys knew Milady perfectly	163.28204345703125
All four were to meet the next day at eleven oclock	79.16270446777344
If they had discovered Miladys retreat three were to remain on guard the fourth was to return to Bthune in order to inform Athos and serve as a guide to the four friends	89.58541870117188
These arrangements made the lackeys retired	72.09506225585938
Athos then arose from his chair girded on his sword enveloped himself in his cloak and left the htel	224.23370361328125
It was nearly ten oclock	1742.4666748046875
At ten oclock in the evening it is well known the streets in provincial towns are very little frequented	4268.7548828125
Athos nevertheless was visibly anxious to find someone of whom he could ask a question	146.90618896484375
At length he met a belated passenger went up to him and spoke a few words to him	1221.30126953125
The man he addressed recoiled with terror and only answered the few words of the Musketeer by pointing	1197.6717529296875
Athos offered the man half a pistole to accompany him but the man refused	40.00405502319336
Athos then plunged into the street the man had indicated with his finger but arriving at four crossroads he stopped again visibly embarrassed	283.4753723144531
Nevertheless as the crossroads offered him a better chance than any other place of meeting somebody he stood still	129.2738800048828
In a few minutes a night watch passed	123.36334991455078
Athos repeated to him the same question he had asked the first person he met	40.210445404052734
The night watch evinced the same terror refused in his turn to accompany Athos and only pointed with his hand to the road he was to take	69.14677429199219
Athos walked in the direction indicated and reached the suburb situated at the opposite extremity of the city from that by which he and his friends had entered it	19.702180862426758
There he again appeared uneasy and embarrassed and stopped for the third time	1717.5721435546875
Fortunately a mendicant passed who coming up to Athos to ask charity Athos offered him half a crown to accompany him where he was going	8.023022651672363
The mendicant hesitated at first but at the sight of the piece of silver which shone in the darkness he consented and walked on before Athos	104.96410369873047
Arrived at the angle of a street he pointed to a small house isolated solitary and dismal	67.78177642822266
Athos went toward the house while the mendicant who had received his reward left as fast as his legs could carry him	11.798158645629883
Athos went round the house before he could distinguish the door amid the red color in which the house was painted	17.30636215209961
No light appeared through the chinks of the shutters no noise gave reason to believe that it was inhabited	71.49258422851562
It was dark and silent as the tomb	2182.0888671875
Three times Athos knocked without receiving an answer	18.80722427368164
At the third knock however steps were heard inside	168.78768920898438
The door at length was opened and a man appeared of high stature pale complexion and black hair and beard	63.26496887207031
Athos and he exchanged some words in a low voice then the tall man made a sign to the Musketeer that he might come in	23.70594596862793
Athos immediately profited by the permission and the door was closed behind him	105.72779083251953
The man whom Athos had come so far to seek and whom he had found with so much trouble introduced him into his laboratory where he was engaged in fastening together with iron wire the dry bones of a skeleton	121.56237030029297
All the frame was adjusted except the head which lay on the table	92.96611785888672
All the rest of the furniture indicated that the dweller in this house occupied himself with the study of natural science	39.139404296875
There were large bottles filled with serpents ticketed according to their species dried lizards shone like emeralds set in great squares of black wood and bunches of wild odoriferous herbs doubtless possessed of virtues unknown to common men were fastened to the ceiling and hung down in the corners of the apartment	44.21776580810547
There was no family no servant the tall man alone inhabited this house	25.108299255371094
Athos cast a cold and indifferent glance upon the objects we have described and at the invitation of him whom he came to seek sat down near him	12.286086082458496
Then he explained to him the cause of his visit and the service he required of him	230.61566162109375
But scarcely had he expressed his request when the unknown who remained standing before the Musketeer drew back with signs of terror and refused	4421.52685546875
Then Athos took from his pocket a small paper on which two lines were written accompanied by a signature and a seal and presented them to him who had made too prematurely these signs of repugnance	554.9882202148438
The tall man had scarcely read these lines seen the signature and recognized the seal when he bowed to denote that he had no longer any objection to make and that he was ready to obey	252.3140411376953
Athos required no more	26.966007232666016
He arose bowed went out returned by the same way he came reentered the htel and went to his apartment	138.21246337890625
At daybreak DArtagnan entered the chamber and demanded what was to be done	16.0720157623291
To wait replied Athos	116.310546875
Some minutes after the superior of the convent sent to inform the Musketeers that the burial would take place at midday	19.366769790649414
As to the poisoner they had heard no tidings of her whatever only that she must have made her escape through the garden on the sand of which her footsteps could be traced and the door of which had been found shut	22.759489059448242
As to the key it had disappeared	215.5536651611328
At the hour appointed Lord de Winter and the four friends repaired to the convent the bells tolled the chapel was open the grating of the choir was closed	3.2221617698669434
In the middle of the choir the body of the victim clothed in her novitiate dress was exposed	279.5799865722656
On each side of the choir and behind the gratings opening into the convent was assembled the whole community of the Carmelites who listened to the divine service and mingled their chant with the chant of the priests without seeing the profane or being seen by them	27.599441528320312
At the door of the chapel DArtagnan felt his courage fall anew and returned to look for Athos but Athos had disappeared	253.76348876953125
Faithful to his mission of vengeance Athos had requested to be conducted to the garden and there upon the sand following the light steps of this woman who left sharp tracks wherever she went he advanced toward the gate which led into the wood and causing it to be opened he went out into the forest	83.44642639160156
Then all his suspicions were confirmed the road by which the carriage had disappeared encircled the forest	211.86351013183594
Athos followed the road for some time his eyes fixed upon the ground slight stains of blood which came from the wound inflicted upon the man who accompanied the carriage as a courier or from one of the horses dotted the road	61.96210479736328
At the end of threequarters of a league within fifty paces of Festubert a larger bloodstain appeared the ground was trampled by horses	349.30255126953125
Between the forest and this accursed spot a little behind the trampled ground was the same track of small feet as in the garden the carriage had stopped here	86.28065490722656
At this spot Milady had come out of the wood and entered the carriage	114.56499481201172
Satisfied with this discovery which confirmed all his suspicions Athos returned to the htel and found Planchet impatiently waiting for him	40.9959602355957
Everything was as Athos had foreseen	142.75271606445312
Planchet had followed the road like Athos he had discovered the stains of blood like Athos he had noted the spot where the horses had halted	139.30682373046875
But he had gone farther than Athosfor at the village of Festubert while drinking at an inn he had learned without needing to ask a question that the evening before at halfpast eight a wounded man who accompanied a lady traveling in a postchaise had been obliged to stop unable to go further	1003.753662109375
The accident was set down to the account of robbers who had stopped the chaise in the wood	1024.7581787109375
The man remained in the village the woman had had a relay of horses and continued her journey	26.182348251342773
Planchet went in search of the postillion who had driven her and found him	115.44900512695312
He had taken the lady as far as Fromelles and from Fromelles she had set out for Armentires	435.9102783203125
Planchet took the crossroad and by seven oclock in the morning he was at Armentires	1037.47314453125
There was but one tavern the Post	307.4759521484375
Planchet went and presented himself as a lackey out of a place who was in search of a situation	41.62275314331055
He had not chatted ten minutes with the people of the tavern before he learned that a woman had come there alone about eleven oclock the night before had engaged a chamber had sent for the master of the htel and told him she desired to remain some time in the neighborhood	309.25836181640625
Planchet had no need to learn more	93.3384780883789
He hastened to the rendezvous found the lackeys at their posts placed them as sentinels at all the outlets of the htel and came to find Athos who had just received this information when his friends returned	55.03116989135742
All their countenances were melancholy and gloomy even the mild countenance of Aramis	155.20375061035156
What is to be done asked DArtagnan	138.07550048828125
To wait replied Athos	322.30072021484375
Each retired to his own apartment	40.6198616027832
At eight oclock in the evening Athos ordered the horses to be saddled and Lord de Winter and his friends notified that they must prepare for the expedition	41.45177459716797
In an instant all five were ready	190.71543884277344
Each examined his arms and put them in order	47.99871826171875
Athos came down last and found DArtagnan already on horseback and growing impatient	78.16827392578125
Patience cried Athos one of our party is still wanting	112.47007751464844
The four horsemen looked round them with astonishment for they sought vainly in their minds to know who this other person could be	294.9959716796875
At this moment Planchet brought out Athoss horse the Musketeer leaped lightly into the saddle	363.63604736328125
Wait for me cried he I will soon be back and he set off at a gallop	15.270855903625488
In a quarter of an hour he returned accompanied by a tall man masked and wrapped in a large red cloak	217.99099731445312
Lord de Winter and the three Musketeers looked at one another inquiringly	488.7423400878906
Neither could give the others any information for all were ignorant who this man could be nevertheless they felt convinced that all was as it should be as it was done by the order of Athos	170.75962829589844
At nine oclock guided by Planchet the little cavalcade set out taking the route the carriage had taken	90.7297134399414
It was a melancholy sightthat of these six men traveling in silence each plunged in his own thoughts sad as despair gloomy as chastisement	470.896484375
Chapter LXV	81.91636657714844
It was a stormy and dark night vast clouds covered the heavens concealing the stars the moon would not rise till midnight	20.617515563964844
Occasionally by the light of a flash of lightning which gleamed along the horizon the road stretched itself before them white and solitary the flash extinct all remained in darkness	209.27943420410156
Every minute Athos was forced to restrain DArtagnan constantly in advance of the little troop and to beg him to keep in the line which in an instant he again departed from	280.14910888671875
He had but one thoughtto go forward and he went	479.7636413574219
They passed in silence through the little village of Festubert where the wounded servant was and then skirted the wood of Richebourg	379.1543884277344
At Herlier Planchet who led the column turned to the left	393.29925537109375
Several times Lord de Winter Porthos or Aramis tried to talk with the man in the red cloak but to every interrogation which they put to him he bowed without response	244.73101806640625
The travelers then comprehended that there must be some reason why the unknown preserved such a silence and ceased to address themselves to him	68.32378387451172
The storm increased the flashes succeeded one another more rapidly the thunder began to growl and the wind the precursor of a hurricane whistled in the plumes and the hair of the horsemen	744.1351928710938
The cavalcade trotted on more sharply	96.6053237915039
A little before they came to Fromelles the storm burst	177.52178955078125
They spread their cloaks	357.791015625
There remained three leagues to travel and they did it amid torrents of rain	10.710000991821289
DArtagnan took off his hat and could not be persuaded to make use of his cloak	265.94970703125
He found pleasure in feeling the water trickle over his burning brow and over his body agitated by feverish shudders	91.9991683959961
The moment the little troop passed Goskal and were approaching the Post a man sheltered beneath a tree detached himself from the trunk with which he had been confounded in the darkness and advanced into the middle of the road putting his finger on his lips	234.81991577148438
Athos recognized Grimaud	137.0194854736328
What s the manner cried Athos	123.4898910522461
Has she left Armentires	298.29840087890625
Grimaud made a sign in the affirmative	347.4198303222656
DArtagnan ground his teeth	105.42572784423828
Silence DArtagnan said Athos	61.35416030883789
I have charged myself with this affair	225.5439910888672
It is for me then to interrogate Grimaud	206.1815948486328
Where is she asked Athos	103.79283905029297
Grimaud extended his hands in the direction of the Lys	203.1465606689453
Far from here asked Athos	1066.787353515625
Grimaud showed his master his forefinger bent	311.7578125
Alone asked Athos	507.2088317871094
Grimaud made the sign yes	88.00025939941406
Gentlemen said Athos she is alone within half a league of us in the direction of the river	252.72958374023438
That s well said DArtagnan	55.1561164855957
Lead us Grimaud	90.23600769042969
Grimaud took his course across the country and acted as guide to the cavalcade	555.3977661132812
At the end of five hundred paces more or less they came to a rivulet which they forded	135.65342712402344
By the aid of the lightning they perceived the village of Erquinheim	58.98765563964844
Is she there Grimaud asked Athos	170.58651733398438
Grimaud shook his head negatively	106.61160278320312
Silence then cried Athos	29.83104133605957
And the troop continued their route	148.29820251464844
Another flash illuminated all around them	476.1102600097656
Grimaud extended his arm and by the bluish splendor of the fiery serpent they distinguished a little isolated house on the banks of the river within a hundred paces of a ferry	2963.795654296875
One window was lighted	1742.7159423828125
Here we are said Athos	167.59774780273438
At this moment a man who had been crouching in a ditch jumped up and came towards them	55.10955810546875
It was Mousqueton	385.31640625
He pointed his finger to the lighted window	77.9490737915039
She is there said he	249.76266479492188
And Bazin asked Athos	102.19288635253906
While I watched the window he guarded the door	442.9199523925781
Good said Athos	190.57518005371094
You are good and faithful servants	734.1451416015625
Athos sprang from his horse gave the bridle to Grimaud and advanced toward the window after having made a sign to the rest of the troop to go toward the door	1242.705078125
The little house was surrounded by a low quickset hedge two or three feet high	137.45858764648438
Athos sprang over the hedge and went up to the window which was without shutters but had the halfcurtains closely drawn	158.41656494140625
He mounted the skirting stone that his eyes might look over the curtain	506.70147705078125
By the light of a lamp he saw a woman wrapped in a dark mantle seated upon a stool near a dying fire	205.9529571533203
Her elbows were placed upon a mean table and she leaned her head upon her two hands which were white as ivory	97.47840118408203
He could not distinguish her countenance but a sinister smile passed over the lips of Athos	304.69281005859375
He was not deceived it was she whom he sought	143.57107543945312
At this moment a horse neighed	350.55047607421875
Milady raised her head saw close to the panes the pale face of Athos and screamed	238.84091186523438
Athos perceiving that she knew him pushed the window with his knee and hand	116.65592193603516
The window yielded	75.1395034790039
The squares were broken to shivers and Athos like the spectre of vengeance leaped into the room	66.3609619140625
Milady rushed to the door and opened it	104.81494903564453
More pale and menacing than Athos DArtagnan stood on the threshold	142.33084106445312
Milady recoiled uttering a cry	165.8898162841797
DArtagnan believing she might have means of flight and fearing she should escape drew a pistol from his belt but Athos raised his hand	80.11341857910156
Put back that weapon DArtagnan said he this woman must be tried not assassinated	106.51241302490234
Wait an instant my friend and you shall be satisfied	245.01828002929688
Come in gentlemen	40.45043182373047
DArtagnan obeyed for Athos had the solemn voice and the powerful gesture of a judge sent by the Lord himself	80.279541015625
Behind DArtagnan entered Porthos Aramis Lord de Winter and the man in the red cloak	94.81209564208984
The four lackeys guarded the door and the window	106.4599609375
Milady had sunk into a chair with her hands extended as if to conjure this terrible apparition	218.6429901123047
Perceiving her brotherinlaw she uttered a terrible cry	84.84337615966797
What do you want screamed Milady	51.43511962890625
We want said Athos Charlotte Backson who first was called Comtesse de la Fre and afterwards Milady de Winter Baroness of Sheffield	302.7986145019531
That is I that is I murmured Milady in extreme terror what do you want	2.000459671020508
We wish to judge you according to your crime said Athos you shall be free to defend yourself	726.5206298828125
Justify yourself if you can	794.0534057617188
dArtagnan it is for you to accuse her first	119.89842224121094
DArtagnan advanced	197.9420623779297
Before God and before men said he I accuse this woman of having poisoned Constance Bonacieux who died yesterday evening	585.68310546875
He turned towards Porthos and Aramis	1372.6640625
We bear witness to this said the two Musketeers with one voice	570.9047241210938
DArtagnan continued Before God and before men I accuse this woman of having attempted to poison me in wine which she sent me from Villeroy with a forged letter as if that wine came from my friends	1177.7852783203125
God preserved me but a man named Brisemont died in my place	95.40424346923828
We bear witness to this said Porthos and Aramis in the same manner as before	122.91228485107422
Before God and before men I accuse this woman of having urged me to the murder of the Baron de Wardes but as no one else can attest the truth of this accusation I attest it myself	131.5457763671875
I have done	447.0390319824219
And DArtagnan passed to the other side of the room with Porthos and Aramis	133.2328643798828
Your turn my Lord said Athos	255.6837921142578
The baron came forward	560.7649536132812
Before God and before men said he I accuse this woman of having caused the assassination of the Duke of Buckingham	1648.131103515625
The Duke of Buckingham assassinated cried all present with one voice	39.01741027832031
Yes said the baron assassinated	126.60066223144531
On receiving the warning letter you wrote to me I had this woman arrested and gave her in charge to a loyal servant	81.8307113647461
She corrupted this man she placed the poniard in his hand she made him kill the duke	54.189605712890625
And at this moment perhaps Felton is paying with his head for the crime of this fury	99.59133911132812
A shudder crept through the judges at the revelation of these unknown crimes	471.6191711425781
That is not all resumed Lord de Winter	89.4676284790039
My brother who made you his heir died in three hours of a strange disorder which left livid traces all over the body	71.89234924316406
My sister how did your husband die	509.8565673828125
Horror cried Porthos and Aramis	392.35107421875
Assassin of Buckingham assassin of Felton assassin of my brother I demand justice upon you and I swear that if it be not granted to me I will execute it myself	199.0732879638672
And Lord de Winter ranged himself by the side of DArtagnan leaving the place free for another accuser	74.05207824707031
Milady let her head sink between her two hands and tried to recall her ideas whirling in a mortal vertigo	914.7398681640625
My turn said Athos himself trembling as the lion trembles at the sight of the serpentmy turn	356.13873291015625
I married that woman when she was a young girl I married her in opposition to the wishes of all my family I gave her my wealth I gave her my name and one day I discovered that this woman was brandedthis woman was marked with a fleurdelis on her left shoulder	145.466064453125
Oh said Milady raising herself I defy you to find any tribunal which pronounced that infamous sentence against me	60.83244323730469
I defy you to find him who executed it	79.7011489868164
Silence said a hollow voice	22.1147403717041
It is for me to reply to that And the man in the red cloak came forward in his turn	109.09944152832031
What man is that What man is that cried Milady suffocated by terror her hair loosening itself and rising above her livid countenance as if alive	94.31424713134766
All eyes were turned towards this manfor to all except Athos he was unknown	406.4217834472656
Even Athos looked at him with as much stupefaction as the others for he knew not how he could in any way find himself mixed up with the horrible drama then unfolded	76.9486083984375
After approaching Milady with a slow and solemn step so that the table alone separated them the unknown took off his mask	82.03289031982422
Milady for some time examined with increasing terror that pale face framed with black hair and whiskers the only expression of which was icy impassibility	52.96133041381836
Then she suddenly cried Oh no no rising and retreating to the very wall	83.46846771240234
No no it is an infernal apparition It is not he Help help screamed she turning towards the wall as if she would tear an opening with her hands	70.24169921875
Who are you then cried all the witnesses of this scene	1057.3504638671875
Ask that woman said the man in the red cloak for you may plainly see she knows me	65.63556671142578
The executioner of Lille the executioner of Lille cried Milady a prey to insensate terror and clinging with her hands to the wall to avoid falling	106.03752899169922
Everyone drew back and the man in the red cloak remained standing alone in the middle of the room	580.0292358398438
Oh grace grace pardon cried the wretch falling on her knees	194.7105255126953
The unknown waited for silence and then resumed I told you well that she would know me	202.4265594482422
Yes I am the executioner of Lille and this is my history	239.581298828125
All eyes were fixed upon this man whose words were listened to with anxious attention	118.88490295410156
That woman was once a young girl as beautiful as she is today	36.829227447509766
She was a nun in the convent of the Benedictines of Templemar	129.38734436035156
A young priest with a simple and trustful heart performed the duties of the church of that convent	135.06690979003906
She undertook his seduction and succeeded she would have seduced a saint	70.3879165649414
Their vows were sacred and irrevocable	224.4080352783203
Their connection could not last long without ruining both	108.19690704345703
She prevailed upon him to leave the country but to leave the country to fly together to reach another part of France where they might live at ease because unknown money was necessary	53.15155792236328
Neither had any	34.27687072753906
The priest stole the sacred vases and sold them but as they were preparing to escape together they were both arrested	98.86055755615234
Eight days later she had seduced the son of the jailer and escaped	195.09036254882812
The young priest was condemned to ten years of imprisonment and to be branded	344.8380432128906
I was executioner of the city of Lille as this woman has said	54.31155014038086
I was obliged to brand the guilty one and he gentlemen was my brother	123.96540832519531
I then swore that this woman who had ruined him who was more than his accomplice since she had urged him to the crime should at least share his punishment	169.88865661621094
I suspected where she was concealed	344.8380432128906
I followed her I caught her I bound her and I imprinted the same disgraceful mark upon her that I had imprinted upon my poor brother	86.49514770507812
The day after my return to Lille my brother in his turn succeeded in making his escape I was accused of complicity and was condemned to remain in his place till he should be again a prisoner	336.58734130859375
My poor brother was ignorant of this sentence	188.96304321289062
He rejoined this woman they fled together into Berry and there he obtained a little curacy	344.8380432128906
This woman passed for his sister	47.11809158325195
The Lord of the estate on which the chapel of the curacy was situated saw this pretend sister and became enamoured of heramorous to such a degree that he proposed to marry her	65.43869018554688
Then she quitted him she had ruined for him she was destined to ruin and became the Comtesse de la Fre	230.49571228027344
All eyes were turned towards Athos whose real name that was and who made a sign with his head that all was true which the executioner had said	150.15887451171875
Then resumed he mad desperate determined to get rid of an existence from which she had stolen everything honor and happiness my poor brother returned to Lille and learning the sentence which had condemned me in his place surrendered himself and hanged himself that same night from the iron bar of the loophole of his prison	85.21699523925781
To do justice to them who had condemned me they kept their word	101.42304992675781
As soon as the identity of my brother was proved I was set at liberty	57.93495559692383
That is the crime of which I accuse her that is the cause for which she was branded	126.41686248779297
Monsieur dArtagnan said Athos what is the penalty you demand against this woman	113.21434783935547
The punishment of death replied DArtagnan	56.12004089355469
My Lord de Winter continued Athos what is the penalty you demand against this woman	359.0699768066406
The punishment of death replied Lord de Winter	313.9525451660156
Messieurs Porthos and Aramis repeated Athos you who are her judges what is the sentence you pronounce upon this woman	1352.6685791015625
The punishment of death replied the Musketeers in a hollow voice	316.74127197265625
Milady uttered a frightful shriek and dragged herself along several paces upon her knees toward her judges	273.78790283203125
Athos stretched out his hand toward her	224.77151489257812
Charlotte Backson Comtesse de la Fre Milady de Winter said he your crimes have wearied men on earth and God in heaven	592.6918334960938
If you know a prayer say itfor you are condemned and you shall die	479.13861083984375
At these words which left no hope Milady raised herself in all her pride and wished to speak but her strength failed her	448.366455078125
She felt that a powerful and implacable hand seized her by the hair and dragged her away as irrevocably as fatality drags humanity	187.25413513183594
She did not therefore even attempt the least resistance and went out of the cottage	96.92855072021484
Lord de Winter DArtagnan Athos Porthos and Aramis went out close behind her	42.56603240966797
The lackeys followed their masters and the chamber was left solitary with its broken window its open door and its smoky lamp burning sadly on the table	1.0454856157302856
Chapter LXVI	104.29043579101562
It was near midnight the moon lessened by its decline and reddened by the last traces of the storm arose behind the little town of Armentires which showed against its pale light the dark outline of its houses and the skeleton of its high belfry	2.000459671020508
In front of them the Lys rolled its waters like a river of molten tin while on the other side was a black mass of trees profiled on a stormy sky invaded by large coppery clouds which created a sort of twilight amid the night	83.84611511230469
On the left was an old abandoned mill with its motionless wings from the ruins of which an owl threw out its shrill periodical and monotonous cry	239.9664764404297
On the right and on the left of the road which the dismal procession pursued appeared a few low stunted trees which looked like deformed dwarfs crouching down to watch men traveling at this sinister hour	82.02588653564453
From time to time a broad sheet of lightning opened the horizon in its whole width darted like a serpent over the black mass of trees and like a terrible scimitar divided the heavens and the waters into two parts	194.00534057617188
Not a breath of wind now disturbed the heavy atmosphere	226.8518829345703
A deathlike silence oppressed all nature	66.67732238769531
The soil was humid and glittering with the rain which had recently fallen and the refreshed herbs sent forth their perfume with additional energy	1.7159162759780884
Two lackeys dragged Milady whom each held by one arm	1130.6749267578125
The executioner walked behind them and Lord de Winter DArtagnan Porthos and Aramis walked behind the executioner	213.38186645507812
Planchet and Bazin came last	246.3145751953125
The two lackeys conducted Milady to the bank of the river	336.95733642578125
Her mouth was mute but her eyes spoke with their inexpressible eloquence supplicating by turns each of those on whom she looked	375.5693054199219
Being a few paces in advance she whispered to the lackeys A thousand pistoles to each of you if you will assist my escape but if you deliver me up to your masters I have near at hand avengers who will make you pay dearly for my death	873.9695434570312
Grimaud hesitated	471.3086853027344
Mousqueton trembled in all his members	62.18145751953125
Athos who heard Miladys voice came sharply up	57.22565841674805
Lord de Winter did the same	62.67495346069336
Change these lackeys said he she has spoken to them	13.155324935913086
They are no longer sure	51.716529846191406
Planchet and Bazin were called and took the places of Grimaud and Mousqueton	31.676664352416992
On the bank of the river the executioner approached Milady and bound her hands and feet	142.02569580078125
Then she broke the silence to cry out You are cowards miserable assassinsten men combined to murder one woman	40.21018600463867
Beware If I am not saved I shall be avenged	69.39328002929688
You are not a woman said Athos coldly and sternly	15.741825103759766
You do not belong to the human species you are a demon escaped from hell whither we send you back again	104.49292755126953
Ah you virtuous men said Milady please to remember that he who shall touch a hair of my head is himself an assassin	166.71205139160156
The executioner may kill without being on that account an assassin said the man in the red cloak rapping upon his immense sword	101.97237396240234
This is the last judge that is all	80.99811553955078
Nachrichter as say our neighbors the Germans	101.16092681884766
And as he bound her while saying these words Milady uttered two or three savage cries which produced a strange and melancholy effect in flying away into the night and losing themselves in the depths of the woods	141.4141845703125
If I am guilty if I have committed the crimes you accuse me of shrieked Milady take me before a tribunal	361.2488098144531
You are not judges You can not condemn me	72.08633422851562
I offered you Tyburn said Lord de Winter	120.0069351196289
Why did you not accept it	90.46732330322266
Because I am not willing to die cried Milady struggling	77.91644287109375
Because I am too young to die	35.380653381347656
The woman you poisoned at Bthune was still younger than you madame and yet she is dead said DArtagnan	51.06154251098633
I will enter a cloister I will become a nun said Milady	163.26513671875
You were in a cloister said the executioner and you left it to ruin my brother	99.68270111083984
Milady uttered a cry of terror and sank upon her knees	509.57464599609375
The executioner took her up in his arms and was carrying her toward the boat	268.54168701171875
Oh my God cried she my God are you going to drown me	48.08843994140625
These cries had something so heartrending in them that M	500.448486328125
dArtagnan who had been at first the most eager in pursuit of Milady sat down on the stump of a tree and hung his head covering his ears with the palms of his hands and yet notwithstanding he could still hear her cry and threaten	702.37646484375
DArtagnan was the youngest of all these men	37.36207580566406
His heart failed him	71.94385528564453
Oh I can not behold this frightful spectacle said he	102.59862518310547
I can not consent that this woman should die thus	237.70846557617188
Milady heard these few words and caught at a shadow of hope	46.48872756958008
DArtagnan DArtagnan cried she remember that I loved you	72.20890808105469
The young man rose and took a step toward her	86.27082061767578
But Athos rose likewise drew his sword and placed himself in the way	69.3028335571289
If you take one step farther DArtagnan said he we shall cross swords together	44.18529510498047
DArtagnan sank on his knees and prayed	85.06017303466797
Come continued Athos executioner do your duty	242.98287963867188
Willingly monseigneur said the executioner for as I am a good Catholic I firmly believe I am acting justly in performing my functions on this woman	27.748125076293945
That s well	214.60696411132812
Athos made a step toward Milady	20.65382957458496
I pardon you said he the ill you have done me	275.6742248535156
I pardon you for my blasted future my lost honor my defiled love and my salvation forever compromised by the despair into which you have cast me	37.49192810058594
Die in peace	64.42133331298828
Lord de Winter advanced in his turn	224.49655151367188
I pardon you said he for the poisoning of my brother and the assassination of his Grace Lord Buckingham	1429.1005859375
I pardon you for the death of poor Felton I pardon you for the attempts upon my own person	154.95594787597656
Die in peace	165.74029541015625
And I said M	153.9462432861328
Pardon me madame for having by a trick unworthy of a gentleman provoked your anger and I in exchange pardon you the murder of my poor love and your cruel vengeance against me	101.63703918457031
I pardon you and I weep for you	132.3077850341797
Die in peace	420.1229248046875
I am lost murmured Milady in English	173.44638061523438
I must die	84.2854995727539
Then she arose of herself and cast around her one of those piercing looks which seemed to dart from an eye of flame	42.930477142333984
She saw nothing she listened and she heard nothing	103.80927276611328
Where am I to die said she	151.179931640625
On the other bank replied the executioner	222.60043334960938
Then he placed her in the boat and as he was going to set foot in it himself Athos handed him a sum of silver	219.2742462158203
Here said he is the price of the execution that it may be plain we act as judges	66.172119140625
That is correct said the executioner and now in her turn let this woman see that I am not fulfilling my trade but my debt	139.4695281982422
And he threw the money into the river	311.18170166015625
The boat moved off toward the lefthand shore of the Lys bearing the guilty woman and the executioner all the others remained on the righthand bank where they fell on their knees	129.6746063232422
The boat glided along the ferry rope under the shadow of a pale cloud which hung over the water at that moment	45.33644485473633
The troop of friends saw it gain the opposite bank the figures were defined like black shadows on the redtinted horizon	598.7513427734375
Milady during the passage had contrived to untie the cord which fastened her feet	252.16464233398438
On coming near the bank she jumped lightly on shore and took to flight	47.988136291503906
But the soil was moist on reaching the top of the bank she slipped and fell upon her knees	112.7624282836914
She was struck no doubt with a superstitious idea she conceived that heaven denied its aid and she remained in the attitude in which she had fallen her head drooping and her hands clasped	417.3045654296875
Then they saw from the other bank the executioner raise both his arms slowly a moonbeam fell upon the blade of the large sword	57.5571403503418
The two arms fell with a sudden force they heard the hissing of the scimitar and the cry of the victim then a truncated mass sank beneath the blow	57.694393157958984
The executioner then took off his red cloak spread it upon the ground laid the body in it threw in the head tied all up by the four corners lifted it on his back and entered the boat again	103.943603515625
In the middle of the stream he stopped the boat and suspending his burden over the water cried in a loud voice Let the justice of God be done and he let the corpse drop into the depths of the waters which closed over it	94.49931335449219
Three days afterward the four Musketeers were in Paris they had not exceeded their leave of absence and that same evening they went to pay their customary visit to M	1508.020263671875
de Trville	1725.3778076171875
Well gentlemen said the brave captain I hope you have been well amused during your excursion	96.40773010253906
Prodigiously replied Athos in the name of himself and his comrades	150.8832244873047
Chapter LXVII	12.147361755371094
On the sixth of the following month the king in compliance with the promise he had made the cardinal to return to La Rochelle left his capital still in amazement at the news which began to spread itself of Buckinghams assassination	297.3454895019531
Although warned that the man she had loved so much was in great danger the queen when his death was announced to her would not believe the fact and even imprudently exclaimed it is false he has just written to me	173.56163024902344
But the next day she was obliged to believe this fatal intelligence Laporte detained in England as everyone else had been by the orders of Charles I	199.65660095214844
arrived and was the bearer of the dukes dying gift to the queen	1402.4854736328125
The joy of the king was lively	263.13360595703125
He did not even give himself the trouble to dissemble and displayed it with affectation before the queen	195.64474487304688
Louis XIII	109.99932861328125
like every weak mind was wanting in generosity	522.6258544921875
But the king soon again became dull and indisposed his brow was not one of those that long remain clear	851.9834594726562
He felt that in returning to camp he should reenter slavery nevertheless he did return	62.87334442138672
The cardinal was for him the fascinating serpent and himself the bird which flies from branch to branch without power to escape	315.3919372558594
The return to La Rochelle therefore was profoundly dull	253.2198028564453
Our four friends in particular astonished their comrades they traveled together side by side with sad eyes and heads lowered	113.37003326416016
Athos alone from time to time raised his expansive brow a flash kindled in his eyes and a bitter smile passed over his lips then like his comrades he sank again into reverie	51.47165298461914
As soon as the escort arrived in a city when they had conducted the king to his quarters the four friends either retired to their own or to some secluded cabaret where they neither drank nor played they only conversed in a low voice looking around attentively to see that no one overheard them	14.228231430053711
One day when the king had halted to fly the magpie and the four friends according to their custom instead of following the sport had stopped at a cabaret on the high road a man coming from la Rochelle on horseback pulled up at the door to drink a glass of wine and darted a searching glance into the room where the four Musketeers were sitting	78.15872955322266
Holloa Monsieur dArtagnan said he is not that you whom I see yonder	236.4354705810547
DArtagnan raised his head and uttered a cry of joy	66.49642944335938
It was the man he called his phantom it was his stranger of Meung of the Rue des Fossoyeurs and of Arras	66.09823608398438
DArtagnan drew his sword and sprang toward the door	249.9019317626953
But this time instead of avoiding him the stranger jumped from his horse and advanced to meet DArtagnan	235.0142822265625
Ah monsieur said the young man I meet you then at last This time you shall not escape me	751.270751953125
Neither is it my intention monsieur for this time I was seeking you in the name of the king I arrest you	1021.091552734375
How what do you say cried DArtagnan	430.8539733886719
I say that you must surrender your sword to me monsieur and that without resistance	31.926834106445312
This concerns your head I warn you	20.568525314331055
Who are you then demanded DArtagnan lowering the point of his sword but without yet surrendering it	73.9573974609375
I am the Chevalier de Rochefort answered the other the equerry of Monsieur le Cardinal Richelieu and I have orders to conduct you to his Eminence	24.069486618041992
We are returning to his Eminence monsieur the Chevalier said Athos advancing and you will please to accept the word of Monsieur dArtagnan that he will go straight to La Rochelle	164.3358917236328
I must place him in the hands of guards who will take him into camp	153.42996215820312
We will be his guards monsieur upon our word as gentlemen but likewise upon our word as gentlemen added Athos knitting his brow Monsieur dArtagnan shall not leave us	184.8168182373047
The Chevalier de Rochefort cast a glance backward and saw that Porthos and Aramis had placed themselves between him and the gate he understood that he was completely at the mercy of these four men	22.205989837646484
Gentlemen said he if Monsieur dArtagnan will surrender his sword to me and join his word to yours I shall be satisfied with your promise to convey Monsieur dArtagnan to the quarters of Monseigneur the Cardinal	101.07640075683594
You have my word monsieur and here is my sword	18.21155548095703
This suits me the better said Rochefort as I wish to continue my journey	99.68597412109375
If it is for the purpose of rejoining Milady said Athos coolly it is useless you will not find her	37.51211929321289
What has become of her then asked Rochefort eagerly	145.17417907714844
Return to camp and you shall know	200.29537963867188
Rochefort remained for a moment in thought then as they were only a days journey from Surgres whither the cardinal was to come to meet the king he resolved to follow the advice of Athos and go with them	103.22306060791016
Besides this return offered him the advantage of watching his prisoner	76.43425750732422
They resumed their route	182.682373046875
On the morrow at three oclock in the afternoon they arrived at Surgres	150.59083557128906
The cardinal there awaited Louis XIII	160.7020721435547
The minister and the king exchanged numerous caresses felicitating each other upon the fortunate chance which had freed France from the inveterate enemy who set all Europe against her	133.9285430908203
After which the cardinal who had been informed that DArtagnan was arrested and who was anxious to see him took leave of the king inviting him to come the next day to view the work already done upon the dyke	18.7462100982666
On returning in the evening to his quarters at the bridge of La Pierre the cardinal found standing before the house he occupied DArtagnan without his sword and the three Musketeers armed	142.4342498779297
This time as he was well attended he looked at them sternly and made a sign with his eye and hand for DArtagnan to follow him	619.0576171875
DArtagnan obeyed	75.16712951660156
We shall wait for you DArtagnan said Athos loud enough for the cardinal to hear him	490.4870300292969
His Eminence bent his brow stopped for an instant and then kept on his way without uttering a single word	62.268455505371094
DArtagnan entered after the cardinal and behind DArtagnan the door was guarded	414.5618591308594
His Eminence entered the chamber which served him as a study and made a sign to Rochefort to bring in the young Musketeer	55.799224853515625
Rochefort obeyed and retired	17.27889633178711
DArtagnan remained alone in front of the cardinal this was his second interview with Richelieu and he afterward confessed that he felt well assured it would be his last	165.33285522460938
Richelieu remained standing leaning against the mantelpiece a table was between him and DArtagnan	104.77532958984375
Monsieur said the cardinal you have been arrested by my orders	33.18049240112305
So they tell me monseigneur	79.39004516601562
Do you know why	129.408935546875
No monseigneur for the only thing for which I could be arrested is still unknown to your Eminence	262.06085205078125
Richelieu looked steadfastly at the young man	790.4174194335938
Holloa said he what does that mean	26.934581756591797
If Monseigneur will have the goodness to tell me in the first place what crimes are imputed to me I will then tell him the deeds I have really done	196.2994384765625
Crimes are imputed to you which had brought down far loftier heads than yours monsieur said the cardinal	146.36514282226562
What monseigneur said DArtagnan with a calmness which astonished the cardinal himself	466.8208312988281
You are charged with having corresponded with the enemies of the kingdom you are charged with having surprised state secrets you are charged with having tried to thwart the plans of your general	275.7868957519531
And who charges me with this monseigneur said DArtagnan who had no doubt the accusation came from Milady a woman branded by the justice of the country a woman who has espoused one man in France and another in England a woman who poisoned her second husband and who attempted both to poison and assassinate me	1117.215576171875
What do you say monsieur cried the cardinal astonished and of what woman are you speaking thus	51.93404769897461
Of Milady de Winter replied DArtagnan yes of Milady de Winter of whose crimes your Eminence is doubtless ignorant since you have honored her with your confidence	590.7640991210938
Monsieur said the cardinal if Milady de Winter has committed the crimes you lay to her charge she shall be punished	193.81300354003906
She has been punished monseigneur	264.67626953125
And who has punished her	124.11186218261719
She is in prison	168.2679901123047
She is dead	39.63201141357422
Dead repeated the cardinal who could not believe what he heard dead Did you not say she was dead	2997.2236328125
Three times she attempted to kill me and I pardoned her but she murdered the woman I loved	147.5218963623047
Then my friends and I took her tried her and condemned her	158.76101684570312
DArtagnan then related the poisoning of Mme	74.28195190429688
Bonacieux in the convent of the Carmelites at Bthune the trial in the isolated house and the execution on the banks of the Lys	30.21043586730957
A shudder crept through the body of the cardinal who did not shudder readily	46.22836685180664
But all at once as if undergoing the influence of an unspoken thought the countenance of the cardinal till then gloomy cleared up by degrees and recovered perfect serenity	53.98075866699219
So said the cardinal in a tone that contrasted strongly with the severity of his words you have constituted yourselves judges without remembering that they who punish without license to punish are assassins	65.11814880371094
Monseigneur I swear to you that I never for an instant had the intention of defending my head against you	3032159.5
I willingly submit to any punishment your Eminence may please to inflict upon me	250.47288513183594
I do not hold life dear enough to be afraid of death	105.28913116455078
Yes I know you are a man of a stout heart monsieur said the cardinal with a voice almost affectionate I can therefore tell you beforehand you shall be tried and even condemned	488.89337158203125
Another might reply to your Eminence that he had his pardon in his pocket	74.38275146484375
I content myself with saying Command monseigneur I am ready	272.55438232421875
Your pardon said Richelieu surprised	75.69705963134766
Yes monseigneur said DArtagnan	7294.45556640625
And signed by whomby the king And the cardinal pronounced these words with a singular expression of contempt	520.1868286132812
No by your Eminence	139.10211181640625
By me You are insane monsieur	456.81134033203125
Monseigneur will doubtless recognize his own handwriting	75.8696060180664
And DArtagnan presented to the cardinal the precious piece of paper which Athos had forced from Milady and which he had given to DArtagnan to serve him as a safeguard	98.39108276367188
His Eminence took the paper and read in a slow voice dwelling upon every syllable	1131.185546875
3 1627	210.56761169433594
It is by my order and for the good of the state that the bearer of this has done what he has done	272.3892517089844
The cardinal after having read these two lines sank into a profound reverie but he did not return the paper to DArtagnan	133.93557739257812
He is meditating by what sort of punishment he shall cause me to die said the Gascon to himself	128.63101196289062
Well my faith he shall see how a gentleman can die	43.46690368652344
The young Musketeer was in excellent disposition to die heroically	30.232866287231445
Richelieu still continued thinking rolling and unrolling the paper in his hands	255.02334594726562
At length he raised his head fixed his eagle look upon that loyal open and intelligent countenance read upon that face furrowed with tears all the sufferings its possessor had endured in the course of a month and reflected for the third or fourth time how much there was in that youth of twentyone years before him and what resources his activity his courage and his shrewdness might offer to a good master	536.424560546875
On the other side the crimes the power and the infernal genius of Milady had more than once terrified him	299.1413879394531
He felt something like a secret joy at being forever relieved of this dangerous accomplice	169.79884338378906
Richelieu slowly tore the paper which DArtagnan had generously relinquished	63.2409553527832
I am lost said DArtagnan to himself	61.85630416870117
And he bowed profoundly before the cardinal like a man who says Lord Thy will be done	241.21478271484375
The cardinal approached the table and without sitting down wrote a few lines upon a parchment of which twothirds were already filled and affixed his seal	152.3793182373047
That is my condemnation thought DArtagnan he will spare me the ennui of the Bastille or the tediousness of a trial	137.48585510253906
That s very kind of him	324.07745361328125
Here monsieur said the cardinal to the young man	254.80262756347656
I have taken from you one carte blanche to give you another	198.6395721435547
The name is wanting in this commission you can write it yourself	730.7301025390625
DArtagnan took the paper hesitatingly and cast his eyes over it it was a lieutenants commission in the Musketeers	154.4254608154297
DArtagnan fell at the feet of the cardinal	150.4454803466797
Monseigneur said he my life is yours henceforth dispose of it	52.16820526123047
But this favor which you bestow upon me I do not merit	142.4389190673828
I have three friends who are more meritorious and more worthy	42.548118591308594
You are a brave youth DArtagnan interrupted the cardinal tapping him familiarly on the shoulder charmed at having vanquished this rebellious nature	122.98651123046875
Do with this commission what you will only remember though the name be blank it is to you I give it	99.13624572753906
I shall never forget it replied DArtagnan	990.9522705078125
Your Eminence may be certain of that	19.081449508666992
The cardinal turned and said in a loud voice Rochefort The chevalier who no doubt was near the door entered immediately	88.34085083007812
Rochefort said the cardinal you see Monsieur dArtagnan	990.9522705078125
I receive him among the number of my friends	77.12003326416016
Greet each other then and be wise if you wish to preserve your heads	109.00698852539062
Rochefort and DArtagnan coolly greeted each other with their lips but the cardinal was there observing them with his vigilant eye	108.87005615234375
They left the chamber at the same time	65.98707580566406
We shall meet again shall we not monsieur	41.56499099731445
When you please said DArtagnan	78.68599700927734
An opportunity will come replied Rochefort	222.7819061279297
Hey said the cardinal opening the door	318.7492370605469
The two men smiled at each other shook hands and saluted his Eminence	120.64564514160156
We were beginning to grow impatient said Athos	397.0189514160156
Here I am my friends replied DArtagnan not only free but in favor	198.60084533691406
Tell us about it	148.19068908691406
This evening but for the moment let us separate	49.08688735961914
Accordingly that same evening DArtagnan repaired to the quarters of Athos whom he found in a fair way to empty a bottle of Spanish winean occupation which he religiously accomplished every night	68.42253875732422
DArtagnan related what had taken place between the cardinal and himself and drawing the commission from his pocket said Here my dear Athos this naturally belongs to you	19.575063705444336
Athos smiled with one of his sweet and expressive smiles	138.43605041503906
Friend said he for Athos this is too much for the Comte de la Fre it is too little	42.89836120605469
Keep the commission it is yours	99.35488891601562
Alas you have purchased it dearly enough	511.6766357421875
DArtagnan left Athoss chamber and went to that of Porthos	33.849403381347656
He found him clothed in a magnificent dress covered with splendid embroidery admiring himself before a glass	29.605613708496094
Ah ah is that you dear friend exclaimed Porthos	85.55958557128906
How do you think these garments fit me	511.6766357421875
Wonderfully said DArtagnan but I come to offer you a dress which will become you still better	172.45115661621094
What asked Porthos	63.44244384765625
That of a lieutenant of Musketeers	131.43116760253906
DArtagnan related to Porthos the substance of his interview with the cardinal and said taking the commission from his pocket Here my friend write your name upon it and become my chief	381.0148010253906
Porthos cast his eyes over the commission and returned it to DArtagnan to the great astonishment of the young man	101.75016021728516
Yes said he yes that would flatter me very much but I should not have time enough to enjoy the distinction	233.95005798339844
During our expedition to Bthune the husband of my duchess died so my dear the coffer of the defunct holding out its arms to me I shall marry the widow	100.87201690673828
Look here I was trying on my wedding suit	323.8418884277344
Keep the lieutenancy my dear keep it	71.57908630371094
The young man then entered the apartment of Aramis	263.873291015625
He found him kneeling before a priedieu with his head leaning on an open prayer book	29.605613708496094
He described to him his interview with the cardinal and said for the third time drawing his commission from his pocket You our friend our intelligence our invisible protector accept this commission	125.143798828125
You have merited it more than any of us by your wisdom and your counsels always followed by such happy results	135.35227966308594
Alas dear friend said Aramis our late adventures have disgusted me with military life	106.76412200927734
This time my determination is irrevocably taken	272.930908203125
After the siege I shall enter the house of the Lazarists	156.55108642578125
Keep the commission DArtagnan the profession of arms suits you	73.90843200683594
You will be a brave and adventurous captain	115.1495361328125
DArtagnan his eye moist with gratitude though beaming with joy went back to Athos whom he found still at table contemplating the charms of his last glass of Malaga by the light of his lamp	1365.6439208984375
Well said he they likewise have refused me	177.62059020996094
That dear friend is because nobody is more worthy than yourself	127.08053588867188
He took a quill wrote the name of DArtagnan in the commission and returned it to him	56.92530059814453
I shall then have no more friends said the young man	278.40753173828125
Alas nothing but bitter recollections	139.36184692382812
And he let his head sink upon his hands while two large tears rolled down his cheeks	112.376220703125
You are young replied Athos and your bitter recollections have time to change themselves into sweet remembrances	106.32466888427734
La Rochelle deprived of the assistance of the English fleet and of the diversion promised by Buckingham surrendered after a siege of a year	69.01033020019531

I shall probably kill you the fourth said he to him holding out his hand to assist him to rise	102.94647216796875
It is much better both for you and for me to stop where we are answered the wounded man	199.98056030273438
Corbleu I am more your friend than you thinkfor after our very first encounter I could by saying a word to the cardinal have had your throat cut	346.1406555175781
